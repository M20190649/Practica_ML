 robust neural machine translation joint textual phonetic embed neural machine translation nmt notoriously sensitive noise noise almost inevitable practice one special kind noise homophone noise word replace word similar pronunciation propose improve robustness nmt homophone noise jointly embed textual phonetic information source sentence augment training dataset homophone noise interestingly achieve good translation quality robustness find though weight put phonetic rather textual information experiment show method significantly improve robustness nmt homophone noise also surprisingly improve translation quality clean test set
