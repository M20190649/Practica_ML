 reasonably accurate automatic speech recognition hard achieve hidden markov model hmms successfully apply automatic speech recognition year spite fact key hmm assumption -- statistical independence frame -- obviously violate speech data fact data model mismatch inspire many attempt modify replace hmms alternative model well able take account statistical dependence frame however fair say hmm consensus model choice speech recognition hmms heart commercially available product contemporary research system paper present preliminary exploration aim understand speech data depart hmms effect departure accuracy hmm-based speech recognition analysis use standard diagnostic tool field statistic -- hypothesis testing simulation resampling -- rarely use field speech recognition main result obtain novel manipulation real resampled data demonstrate real data statistical dependency dependency responsible significant number recognition error also demonstrate use simulation resampling remove statistical dependency data result recognition error rate become negligible take together result suggest good understanding structure statistical dependency speech data crucial first step towards improve hmm-based speech recognition
