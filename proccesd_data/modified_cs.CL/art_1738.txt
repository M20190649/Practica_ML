 recurrent neural network postfilters statistical parametric speech synthesis last two year numerous paper look use deep neural network replace acoustic model traditional statistical parametric speech synthesis however far less attention pay approach like dnn-based postfiltering dnns work conjunction traditional acoustic model paper investigate use recurrent neural network potential postfilter synthesis explore possibility replace exist postfilters well highlight ease arbitrary new feature add input postfilter also try novel approach jointly train classification regression tree postfilter rather traditional approach train independently
