 jointly learn sentence embeddings syntax unsupervised tree-lstms introduce neural network represent sentence compose word accord induced binary parse tree use tree-lstm composition function apply along tree structure find fully differentiable natural language chart parser model simultaneously optimise composition function parser thus eliminate need externally-provided parse tree normally require tree-lstm therefore see tree-based rnn unsupervised respect parse tree fully differentiable model easily train off-the-shelf gradient descent method backpropagation demonstrate achieve good performance compare various supervised tree-lstm architecture textual entailment task reverse dictionary task
