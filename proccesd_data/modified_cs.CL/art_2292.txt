 beam search strategy neural machine translation basic concept neural machine translation nmt train large neural network maximize translation performance give parallel corpus nmt use simple left-to-right beam-search decoder generate new translation approximately maximize trained conditional probability current beam search strategy generate target sentence word word left-to- right keep fixed amount active candidate time step first simple search less adaptive also expand candidate whose score much bad current best secondly expand hypothesis within best scoring candidate even score close best one latter one avoid increase beam size performance improvement observe reach good performance draw- back slow decode speed paper concentrate speed decoder apply flexible beam search strategy whose candidate size may vary time step depend candidate score speed original decoder two language pair german-english chinese-english without lose translation quality
