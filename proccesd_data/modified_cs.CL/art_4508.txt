 rational recurrence despite tremendous empirical success neural model natural language processing many lack strong intuition accompany classical machine learning approach recently connection show convolutional neural network cnns weight finite state automaton wfsas lead new interpretation insight work show recurrent neural network also share connection wfsas characterize connection formally define rational recurrence recurrent hidden state update function write forward calculation finite set wfsas show several recent neural model use rational recurrence analysis provide fresh view model facilitates devise new neural architecture draw inspiration wfsas present one model perform good two recent baseline language modeling text classification result demonstrate transfer intuition classical model like wfsas effective approach design understanding neural model
