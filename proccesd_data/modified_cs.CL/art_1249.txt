 empirical exploration skip connection sequential tagging paper empirically explore effect various kind skip connection stacked bidirectional lstms sequential tagging investigate three kind skip connection connect lstm cell skip connection gate b skip connection internal state c skip connection cell output present comprehensive experiment show skip connection cell output outperform remain two furthermore observe use gate identity function skip mapping work pretty well base novel skip connection successfully train deep stack bidirectional lstm model obtain state-of-the-art result ccg supertagging comparable result pos tagging
