 inside-outside estimation meet dynamic em briefly review inside-outside em algorithm probabilistic context-free grammar result formally prove inside-outside estimation dynamic-programming variant em interest right even consider theoretical context since well-known convergence behavior inside-outside estimation confirm many experiment apparently never formally prove however version em inside-outside estimation also inherit good convergence behavior em therefore yet imperfect line argumentation transform coherent proof
