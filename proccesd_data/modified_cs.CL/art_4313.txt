 low-latency neural speech translation development neural machine translation quality machine translation system improve significantly exploit advancement deep learning system able well approximate complex mapping source sentence target sentence ability new challenge also arise example translation partial sentence low-latency speech translation since model see complete sentence training always try generate complete sentence though input may partial sentence show nmt system adapt scenarios task-specific training data available furthermore possible without lose performance original training data achieve create artificial data use multi-task learning adaptation able reduce number correction display incremental output construction without decrease translation quality
