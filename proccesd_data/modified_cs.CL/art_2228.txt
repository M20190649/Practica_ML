 real multi-sense pseudo multi-sense approach improve word representation previous research show learn multiple representation polysemous word improve performance word embeddings many task however lead another problem several vector word may actually point meaning namely pseudo multi-sense paper introduce concept pseudo multi-sense propose algorithm detect case consideration detected pseudo multi-sense case try refine exist word embeddings eliminate influence pseudo multi-sense moreover apply algorithm previous release multi-sense word embeddings test artificial word similarity task analogy task result experiment show diminish pseudo multi-sense improve quality word representation thus method actually efficient way reduce linguistic complexity
