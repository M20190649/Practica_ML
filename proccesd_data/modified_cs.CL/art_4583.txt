 beyond error propagation neural machine translation characteristic language also matter neural machine translation usually adopt autoregressive model suffers exposure bias well consequent error propagation problem many previous work discuss relationship error propagation emph accuracy drop i.e. left part translated sentence often good right part left-to-right decoding model problem paper conduct series analysis deeply understand problem get several interesting finding role error propagation accuracy drop overstate literature although indeed contribute accuracy drop problem characteristic language play important role cause accuracy drop left part translation result right-branching language e.g. english likely accurate right part right part accurate left-branching language e.g. japanese discovery confirm different model structure include transformer rnn sequence generation task text summarization
