 sketch word vector hash propose new fast word embed technique use hash function method derandomization new type random projection disregard classic constraint use design random projection i.e. preserve pairwise distance particular normed space solution exploit extremely sparse non-negative random projection experiment show propose method achieve competitive result comparable neural embed learn technique however fraction computational complexity method propose derandomization enhance computational space complexity method possibility apply weight method positive pointwise mutual information ppmi model construction reduced dimensionality impart high discriminatory power resulting embeddings obviously method come known benefit random projection-based technique ease update
