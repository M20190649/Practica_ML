 aspect base sentiment analysis gated convolutional network aspect base sentiment analysis absa provide detailed information general sentiment analysis aim predict sentiment polarity give aspect entity text summarize previous approach two subtasks aspect-category sentiment analysis acsa aspect-term sentiment analysis atsa previous approach employ long short-term memory attention mechanism predict sentiment polarity concerned target often complicate need training time propose model base convolutional neural network gate mechanism accurate efficient first novel gate tanh-relu unit selectively output sentiment feature accord give aspect entity architecture much simple attention layer use exist model second computation model could easily parallelize training convolutional layer time dependency lstm layer gate unit also work independently experiment semeval datasets demonstrate efficiency effectiveness model
