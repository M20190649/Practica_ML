 dialogue act sequence label use hierarchical encoder crf dialogue act recognition associate dialogue act i.e. semantic label utterance conversation problem associate semantic label utterance treat sequence labeling problem work build hierarchical recurrent neural network use bidirectional lstm base unit conditional random field crf top layer classify utterance correspond dialogue act hierarchical network learns representation multiple level i.e. word level utterance level conversation level conversation level representation input crf layer take account previous utterance also dialogue act thus model dependency among label utterance important consideration natural dialogue validate approach two different benchmark data set switchboard meeting recorder dialogue act show performance improvement state-of-the-art method absolute point respectively worth note inter-annotator agreement switchboard data set method able achieve accuracy despite train noisy data
