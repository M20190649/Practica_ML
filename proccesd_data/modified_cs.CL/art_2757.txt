 sentence-level quality estimation predict hter multi-component metric submission investigate alternative machine learning model predict hter score sentence level instead directly predict hter score suggest model jointly predict amount distinct post-editing operation use calculate hter score also give possibility correct invalid e.g negative predict value prior calculation hter score without feature exploration multi-layer perceptron outputs yield small significant improvement baseline
