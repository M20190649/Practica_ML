 efficient character-level document classification combine convolution recurrent layer document classification task primarily tackle word level recent research work character-level input show several benefit word-level approach natural incorporation morpheme good handling rare word propose neural network architecture utilize convolution recurrent layer efficiently encode character input validate propose model eight large scale document classification task compare character-level convolution-only model achieve comparable performance much less parameter
