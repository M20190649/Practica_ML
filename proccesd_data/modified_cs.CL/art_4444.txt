 revisit importance encode logic rule sentiment classification analyze performance different sentiment classification model syntactically complex input like a-but-b sentence first contribution analysis address reproducible research meaningfully compare different model accuracy must average far random seed traditionally report proper average place notice distillation model describe arxiv v cs.lg incorporate explicit logic rule sentiment classification ineffective contrast use contextualized elmo embeddings arxiv v cs.cl instead logic rule yield significantly good performance additionally provide analysis visualization demonstrate elmo 's ability implicitly learn logic rule finally crowdsourced analysis reveal elmo outperforms baseline model even sentence ambiguous sentiment label
