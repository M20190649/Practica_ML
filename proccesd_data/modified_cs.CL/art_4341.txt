 efficient human-like semantic representation via information bottleneck principle maintain efficient semantic representation environment major challenge human machine human language represent useful solution problem yet clear computational principle could give rise similar solution machine work propose answer open question suggest languages compress percept word optimize information bottleneck ib tradeoff complexity accuracy lexicon present empirical evidence principle may give rise human-like semantic representation explore human languages categorize color show color name system across language near-optimal ib sense natural system similar artificial ib color name system single tradeoff parameter control cross-language variability addition ib system evolve sequence structural phase transition demonstrate possible adaptation process work thus identify computational principle characterize human semantic system could usefully inform semantic representation machine
