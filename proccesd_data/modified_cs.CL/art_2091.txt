 factored neural machine translation present new approach neural machine translation nmt use morphological grammatical decomposition word factor output side neural network architecture address two main problem occur mt namely deal large target language vocabulary vocabulary oov word mean factor able handle large vocabulary reduce training time system equivalent target language vocabulary size addition produce new word vocabulary use morphological analyser get factored representation word lemma part speech tag tense person gender number extend nmt approach attention mechanism order two different output one lemma rest factor final translation build use textit priori linguistic information compare extension word-based nmt system experiment perform iwslt dataset translating english french show performance always increase system manage much large vocabulary consistently reduce oov rate observe bleu point improvement simulate domain translation setup
