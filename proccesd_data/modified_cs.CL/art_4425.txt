 keyphrase generation correlation constraint paper study automatic keyphrase generation although conventional approach task show promising result neglect correlation among keyphrases result duplication coverage issue solve problem propose new sequence-to-sequence architecture keyphrase generation name corrrnn capture correlation among multiple keyphrases two way first employ coverage vector indicate whether word source document summarize previous phrase improve coverage keyphrases second preceding phrase take account eliminate duplicate phrase improve result coherence experiment result show model significantly outperform state-of-the-art method benchmark datasets term accuracy diversity
