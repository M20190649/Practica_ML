 large-scale domain adaptation via teacher-student learning high accuracy speech recognition require large amount transcribed data supervised training absence data domain adaptation well-trained acoustic model perform even high accuracy usually require significant label data target domain work propose approach domain adaptation require transcription instead use corpus unlabeled parallel data consist pair sample source domain well-trained model desired target domain perform adaptation employ teacher student learning posterior probability generate source-domain model use lieu label train target-domain model evaluate propose approach two scenario adapt clean acoustic model noisy speech adapt adults speech acoustic model child speech significant improvement accuracy obtain reduction word error rate original source model without need transcribed data target domain moreover show increase amount unlabeled data result additional model robustness particularly beneficial use simulate training data target-domain
