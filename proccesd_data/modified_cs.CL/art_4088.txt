 neural network model paraphrase identification semantic textual similarity natural language inference question answering paper analyze several neural network design variation sentence pair modeling compare performance extensively across eight datasets include paraphrase identification semantic textual similarity natural language inference question answer task although model claim state-of-the-art performance original paper often report one two select datasets provide systematic study show encode contextual information lstm inter-sentence interaction critical ii tree-lstm help much previously claim surprisingly improve performance twitter datasets iii enhanced sequential inference model best far large datasets pairwise word interaction model achieve best performance less data available release implementation open-source toolkit
