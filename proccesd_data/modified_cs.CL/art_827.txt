 contrastive unsupervised word alignment non-local feature word alignment important natural language processing task indicate correspondence natural language recently unsupervised learning log-linear model word alignment receive considerable attention combine merit generative discriminative approach however major challenge still remain intractable calculate expectation non-local feature critical capture divergence natural language propose contrastive approach aim differentiate observed training example noise introduce prior knowledge guide unsupervised learning also cancel partition function base observation probability mass log-linear model word alignment usually highly concentrated propose use top-n alignment approximate expectation respect posterior distribution allow efficient accurate calculation expectation non-local feature experiment show approach achieve significant improvement state-of-the-art unsupervised word alignment method
