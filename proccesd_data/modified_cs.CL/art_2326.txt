 transfer deep learning low-resource chinese word segmentation novel neural network recent study show effectiveness use neural network chinese word segmentation however model rely large-scale data less effective low-resource datasets insufficient training data propose transfer learn method improve low-resource word segmentation leverage high-resource corpus first train teacher model high-resource corpus use learned knowledge initialize student model second weighted data similarity method propose train student model low-resource data experiment result show work significantly improve performance low-resource datasets f-score pku ctb datasets furthermore paper achieve state-of-the-art result f-score pku ctb datasets
