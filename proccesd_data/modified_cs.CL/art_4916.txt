 deep graph convolutional encoders structure data text generation previous work neural text generation graph-structured data relies standard sequence-to-sequence method approach linearise input graph feed recurrent neural network paper propose alternative encoder base graph convolutional network directly exploit input structure report result two graph-to-sequence datasets empirically show benefit explicitly encode input graph structure
