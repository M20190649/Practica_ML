 neural machine translation framework base cross-lingual document vector distance constraint train universal cross-lingual representation document important many natural language processing task paper present document vectorization method effectively create document vector via self-attention mechanism use neural machine translation nmt framework model use method train parallel corpus unrelated task hand test method take monolingual document convert neural machine translation framework base crosslingual document vector distance constraint training cntdv cntdv follow-up study previous research neural machine translation framework base document vector cntdv produce document vector forward-pass encoder fast speed moreover train distance constraint document vector obtain different language pair always consistent cross-lingual document classification task cntdv embeddings surpass publish state-of-the-art performance english-to-german classification test best knowledge also achieve second best performance german-to-english classification test compare previous research need translator testing process make model faster convenient
