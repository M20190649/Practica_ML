 learn compose task-specific tree structure year recursive neural network rvnns show suitable represent text fixed-length vector achieve good performance several natural language processing task however main drawback rvnns require structured input make data preparation model implementation hard paper propose gumbel tree-lstm novel tree-structured long short-term memory architecture learn compose task-specific tree structure plain text data efficiently model use straight-through gumbel-softmax estimator decide parent node among candidate dynamically calculate gradient discrete decision evaluate propose model natural language inference sentiment analysis show model outperforms least comparable previous model also find model converge significantly faster model
