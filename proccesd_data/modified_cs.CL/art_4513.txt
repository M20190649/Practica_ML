 temporal information extraction predict relative time-lines current leading paradigm temporal information extraction text consists three phase recognition event temporal expression recognition temporal relation among time-line construction temporal relation contrast first two phase last phase time-line construction receive little attention focus work paper propose new method construct linear time-line set extracted temporal relation importantly propose novel paradigm directly predict start end-points event text constitute time-line without go intermediate step prediction temporal relation early work within paradigm propose two model predict linear complexity new training loss use timeml-style annotation yield promising result
