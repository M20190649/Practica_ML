 pre-translation neural machine translation recently development neural machine translation nmt significantly improve translation quality automatic machine translation sentence accurate fluent translation statistical machine translation smt -based system case nmt system produce translation completely different meaning especially case rare word occur use statistical machine translation already show significant gain achieve simplify input preprocessing step commonly used example pre-reordering approach work use phrase-based machine translation pre-translate input target language neural machine translation system generate final hypothesis use pre-translation thereby use either output phrase-based machine translation pbmt system combination pbmt output source sentence evaluate technique english german translation task use approach able outperform pbmt system well baseline neural mt system bleu point analyze influence quality initial system final result
