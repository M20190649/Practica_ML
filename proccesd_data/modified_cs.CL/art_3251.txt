 train test anywhere zero-shot learning text classification zero-shot learner model capable predict unseen class work propose zero-shot learning approach text categorization method involve train model large corpus sentence learn relationship sentence embedding sentence 's tag learn relationship make model generalize unseen sentence tag even new datasets provide put embed space model learn predict whether give sentence relate tag unlike classifier learn classify sentence one possible class propose three different neural network task report accuracy test set dataset use train well two standard datasets retraining do show model generalize well across new unseen class case although model achieve accuracy level state art supervise model yet evidently step forward towards general intelligence natural language processing
