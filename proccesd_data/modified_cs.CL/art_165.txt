 probabilistic top-down parsing language modeling paper describe functioning broad-coverage probabilistic top-down parser application problem language modeling speech recognition paper first introduce key notion language modeling probabilistic parsing briefly review previous approach use syntactic structure language modeling lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser present perform well term accuracy returned par efficiency find relative best broad-coverage statistical parser new language model utilize probabilistic top-down parsing outline empirical result show improve upon previous work test corpus perplexity interpolation trigram model yield exceptional improvement relative improvement observe model demonstrate degree information capture parse model orthogonal capture trigram model small recognition experiment also demonstrate utility model
