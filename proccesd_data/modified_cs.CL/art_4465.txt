 semi-autoregressive neural machine translation exist approach neural machine translation typically autoregressive model model attain state-of-the-art translation quality suffer low parallelizability thus slow decode long sequence paper propose novel model fast sequence generation -- semi-autoregressive transformer sat sat keep autoregressive property global relieve local thus able produce multiple successive word parallel time step experiment conduct english-german chinese-english translation task show sat achieve good balance translation quality decode speed wmt english-german translation sat achieves time speedup maintains translation quality significantly good previous non-autoregressive method produce two word time step sat almost lossless degeneration bleu score
