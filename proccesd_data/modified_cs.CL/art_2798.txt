 challenge data-to-document generation recent neural model show significant progress problem generate short descriptive text condition small number database record work suggest slightly difficult data-to-text generation task investigate effective current approach task particular introduce new large-scale corpus data record pair descriptive document propose series extractive evaluation method analyze performance obtain baseline result use current neural generation method experiment show model produce fluent text fail convincingly approximate human-generated document moreover even templated baseline exceed performance neural model metric though copy- reconstruction-based extension lead noticeable improvement
