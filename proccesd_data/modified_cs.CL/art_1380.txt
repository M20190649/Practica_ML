 text classification improve integrate bidirectional lstm two-dimensional max pool recurrent neural network rnn one popular architecture use natural language process nlp task recurrent structure suitable process variable-length text rnn utilize distributed representation word first convert token comprise text vector form matrix matrix include two dimension time-step dimension feature vector dimension exist model usually utilize one-dimensional max pool operation attention-based operation time-step dimension obtain fixed-length vector however feature feature vector dimension mutually independent simply apply pooling operation time-step dimension independently may destroy structure feature representation hand apply two-dimensional pooling operation two dimension may sample meaningful feature sequence modeling task integrate feature dimension matrix paper explore apply max pool operation obtain fixed-length representation text paper also utilizes convolution sample meaningful information matrix experiment conduct six text classification task include sentiment analysis question classification subjectivity classification newsgroup classification compare state-of-the-art model propose model achieve excellent performance task specifically one propose model achieve high accuracy stanford sentiment treebank binary classification fine-grained classification task
