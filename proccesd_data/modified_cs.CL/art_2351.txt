 fine-grained entity type classification jointly learn representation label embeddings fine-grained entity type classification fetc task classify entity mention broad set type distant supervision paradigm extensively use generate training data task however generate training data assigns set label every mention entity without consider local context exist fetc system two major drawback assume train data noise free use hand craft feature work overcomes drawback propose neural network model jointly learn entity mention context representation eliminate use hand craft feature model treat train data noisy use non-parametric variant hinge loss function experiment show propose model outperform previous state-of-the-art method two publicly available datasets namely figer gold bbn average relative improvement micro-f score knowledge learnt model one dataset transfer datasets use model fetc system approach transfer knowledge improve performance respective model
