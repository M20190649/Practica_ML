 multilayer network language unified framework structural analysis linguistic subsystem recently focus complex network research shift analysis isolated property system toward realistic modeling multiple phenomenon multilayer network motivate prosperity multilayer approach social transport trade system propose introduction multilayer network language multilayer network language unified framework model linguistic subsystem structural property enable exploration mutual interaction various aspect natural language system represent complex network whose vertex depict linguistic unit link model relation multilayer network language define three aspect network construction principle linguistic subsystem language interest precisely construct word-level syntax co-occurrence shuffled counterpart subword level syllable grapheme network layer five variation original text modeled language obtained result suggest substantial difference network structure different language subsystem hide exploration isolated layer word-level layer share structural property regardless language e.g croatian english syllabic subword level express language dependent structural property preserve weighted overlap quantify similarity word-level layer weighted direct network moreover analysis motif reveals close topological structure syntactic syllabic layer language finding corroborate multilayer network framework powerful consistent systematic approach model several linguistic subsystem simultaneously hence provide unified view language
