 completely unsupervised phoneme recognition adversarially learn map relationship audio embeddings unsupervised discovery acoustic token audio corpus without annotation learn vector representation token widely study although technique show successful application query-by-example spoken term detection std lack map relationship discover token real phoneme limit down-stream application paper represent probably first attempt towards goal completely unsupervised phoneme recognition map audio signal phoneme sequence without phoneme-labeled audio data basic idea cluster embedded acoustic token learn mapping cluster sequence unknown phoneme sequence generative adversarial network gan unsupervised phoneme recognition accuracy achieve preliminary experiment
