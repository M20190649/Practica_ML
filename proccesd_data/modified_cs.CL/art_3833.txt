 neural machine translation bilingually scarce scenario deep multi-task learn approach neural machine translation require large amount parallel train text learn reasonable-quality translation model particularly inconvenient language pair enough parallel text available paper use monolingual linguistic resource source side address challenging problem base multi-task learning approach specifically scaffold machine translation task auxiliary task include semantic parsing syntactic parsing named-entity recognition effectively inject semantic syntactic knowledge translation model would otherwise require large amount train bitext empirically evaluate show effectiveness multi-task learn approach three translation task english-to-french english-to-farsi english-to-vietnamese
