 weakly-supervised relation extraction pattern-enhanced embed learn extract relation text corpus important task text mining become particularly challenging focus weakly-supervised relation extraction utilize relation instance i.e. pair entity relation seed extract instance corpus exist distributional approach leverage corpus-level co-occurrence statistic entity predict relation require large number labeled instance learn effective relation classifier alternatively pattern-based approach perform bootstrapping apply neural network model local context still rely large number labeled instance build reliable model paper study integrate distributional pattern-based method weakly-supervised setting two type method provide complementary supervision build effective unified model propose novel co-training framework distributional module pattern module training distributional module help pattern module discriminate informative pattern pattern pattern module generate highly-confident instance improve distributional module whole framework effectively optimize iterate improve pattern module update distributional module conduct experiment two task knowledge base completion text corpus corpus-level relation extraction experimental result prove effectiveness framework weakly-supervised setting
