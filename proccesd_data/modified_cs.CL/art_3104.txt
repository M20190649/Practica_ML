 enhanced neural machine translation learn draft neural machine translation nmt recently achieve impressive result potential problem exist nmt algorithm however decoding conduct leave right without consider right context paper propose two-stage approach solve problem first stage conventional attention-based nmt system use produce draft translation second stage novel double-attention nmt system use refine translation look original input well draft translation drafting-and-refinement obtain right-context information draft hence produce consistent translation evaluate approach use two chinese-english translation task one k pair pair respectively experiment show approach achieve positive improvement conventional nmt system improvement bleu point small-scale large-scale task respectively
