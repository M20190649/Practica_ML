 lifelong domain word embed via meta-learning learn high-quality domain word embeddings important achieve good performance many nlp task general-purpose embeddings train large-scale corpus often sub-optimal domain-specific application however domain-specific task often large in-domain corpus train high-quality domain embeddings paper propose novel lifelong learn set domain embedding perform new domain embedding system see many past domain try expand new in-domain corpus exploit corpus past domain via meta-learning propose meta-learner characterize similarity context word many domain corpus help retrieve relevant data past domain expand new domain corpus experimental result show domain embeddings produce process improve performance downstream task
