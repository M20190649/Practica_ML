 three new method evaluate reference resolution reference resolution extend texts several thousand reference evaluate manually evaluation algorithm propose muc test use equivalence class coreference relation however show algorithm indulgent yield good score even poor resolution strategy elaborate formalism propose two new evaluation algorithm compare first muc algorithm give result variety example third algorithm use distributional comparison equivalence class finally describe assess relative importance recall vs. precision error
