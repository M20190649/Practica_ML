 neural machine translation simplify translation text simplification aim reduce lexical grammatical structural complexity text keep meaning context machine translation introduce idea simplified translation order boost learning ability deep neural translation model conduct preliminary experiment show translation complexity actually reduce translation source bi-text compare target reference bi-text use neural machine translation nmt system learn exact bi-text base knowledge distillation idea train nmt system use simplified bi-text show outperform initial system build reference data set performance boost reference automatic translation use learn network perform elementary analysis translate corpus report accuracy result propose approach english-to-french english-to-german translation task
