 context-dependent fine-grained entity type tag entity type tagging task assign category label mention entity document standard system focus small set type recent work ling weld suggest use large fine-grained label set lead dramatic improvement downstream task absence labeled training data exist fine-grained tag system obtain example automatically use resolve entity type extract knowledge base however since appropriate type often depend context e.g washington could tag either city government procedure result spurious label lead poorer generalization propose task context-dependent fine type tagging set acceptable label mention restrict deducible local context e.g sentence document introduce new resource task mention annotate context-dependent fine type provide baseline experimental result data
