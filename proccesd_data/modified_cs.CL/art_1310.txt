 dual learning machine translation neural machine translation nmt make good progress past two year ten million bilingual sentence pair need training however human labeling costly tackle training data bottleneck develop dual-learning mechanism enable nmt system automatically learn unlabeled data dual-learning game mechanism inspire following observation machine translation task dual task e.g. english-to-french translation primal versus french-to-english translation dual primal dual task form closed loop generate informative feedback signal train translation model even without involvement human labeler dual-learning mechanism use one agent represent model primal task agent represent model dual task ask teach reinforcement learn process base feedback signal generate process e.g. language-model likelihood output model reconstruction error original sentence primal dual translation iteratively update two model convergence e.g. use policy gradient method call corresponding approach neural machine translation emph dual-nmt experiment show dual-nmt work well english leftrightarrow french translation especially learn monolingual data bilingual data warm start achieve comparable accuracy nmt train full bilingual data french-to-english translation task
