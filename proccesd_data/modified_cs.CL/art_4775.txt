 joint multitask learn community question answer use task-specific embeddings address jointly two important task question answering community forum give new question find related exist question ii find relevant answer new question use auxiliary task complement previous two i.e. iii find good answer respect thread question question-comment thread use deep neural network dnns learn meaningful task-specific embeddings incorporate conditional random field crf model multitask setting perform joint learning complex graph structure dnns alone achieve competitive result train produce embeddings crf make use embeddings dependency task improve result significantly consistently across variety evaluation metric thus show complementarity dnns structure learning
