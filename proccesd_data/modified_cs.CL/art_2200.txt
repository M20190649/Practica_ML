 scdv sparse composite document vector use soft clustering distributional representation present feature vector formation technique document sparse composite document vector scdv overcome several shortcoming current distributional paragraph vector representation widely use text representation scdv word embedding 's cluster capture multiple semantic context word occur chain together form document topic-vectors express complex multi-topic document extensive experiment multi-class multi-label classification task outperform previous state-of-the-art method ntsg liu et al. also show scdv embed 's perform well heterogeneous task like topic coherence context-sensitive learning information retrieval moreover achieve significant reduction training prediction time compare representation method scdv achieve best world good performance low time space complexity
