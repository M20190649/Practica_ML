 sgm sequence generation model multi-label classification multi-label classification important yet challenge task natural language processing complex single-label classification label tend correlate exist method tend ignore correlation label besides different part text contribute differently predict different label consider exist model paper propose view multi-label classification task sequence generation problem apply sequence generation model novel decoder structure solve extensive experimental result show propose method outperform previous work substantial margin analysis experimental result demonstrate propose method capture correlation label also select informative word automatically predict different label
