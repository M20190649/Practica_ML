 investigate well contextual feature capture bi-directional recurrent neural network model learn algorithm natural language processing nlp task traditionally rely manually define relevant contextual feature hand neural network model use distributional representation word successfully apply several nlp task model learn feature automatically avoid explicit feature engineering across several domain neural model become natural choice specifically limited characteristic data know however flexibility come cost interpretability paper define three different method investigate ability bi-directional recurrent neural network rnns capture contextual feature particular analyze rnns sequence tagging task perform comprehensive analysis general well biomedical domain datasets experiment focus important contextual word feature easily extend analyze various feature type also investigate positional effect context word show developed method use error analysis
