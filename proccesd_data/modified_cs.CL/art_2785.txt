 sequential model classify temporal relation intra-sentence event present sequential model temporal relation classification intra-sentence event key observation overall syntactic structure compositional meaning multi-word context event important distinguish among fine-grained temporal relation specifically approach first extract sequence context word indicate temporal relation two event well align dependency path two event mention context word sequence together parts-of-speech tag sequence dependency relation sequence generate correspond word sequence provide input bidirectional recurrent neural network lstm model neural net learn compositional syntactic semantic representation context surround two event predict temporal relation evaluation propose approach timebank corpus show sequential modeling capable accurately recognize temporal relation event outperform neural net model use various discrete feature input imitate previous feature base model
