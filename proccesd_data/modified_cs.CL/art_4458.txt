 explore recombination efficient decoding neural machine translation neural machine translation nmt decoder capture feature entire prediction history neural connection representation mean partial hypothesis different prefix regard differently matter similar however might inefficient since partial hypothesis contain local difference influence future prediction work introduce recombination nmt decode base concept equivalence partial hypothesis heuristically use simple n -gram suffix base equivalence function adapt beam search decoding experiment large-scale chinese-to-english english-to-germen translation task show propose method obtain similar translation quality small beam size make nmt decode efficient
