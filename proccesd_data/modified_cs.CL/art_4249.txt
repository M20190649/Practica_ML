 low-resource text classification use domain-adversarial learning deep learning technique recently show successful many natural language processing task form state-of-the-art system require however large amount annotate data often miss paper explore use domain-adversarial learning regularizer avoid overfitting train domain invariant feature deep complex neural network low-resource zero-resource setting new target domain language case new language show monolingual word-vectors directly use train without pre-alignment projection common space learnt ad-hoc training time reach final performance pretrained multilingual word-vectors
