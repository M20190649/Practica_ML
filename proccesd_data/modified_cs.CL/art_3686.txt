 event extraction generative adversarial imitation learn propose new method event extraction ee task base imitation learning framework specifically inverse reinforcement learn irl via generative adversarial network gan gan estimate proper reward accord difference action commit expert ground truth agent among complicated state environment ee task benefit dynamic reward instance label yield various extent difficulty gain expect diverse -- e.g. ambiguous correctly detect trigger argument receive high gain -- traditional rl model usually neglect difference pay equal attention instance moreover experiment also demonstrate propose framework outperform state-of-the-art method without explicit feature engineering
