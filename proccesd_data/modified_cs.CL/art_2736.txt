 neural reranking name entity recognition propose neural reranking system name entity recognition ner basic idea leverage recurrent neural network model learn sentence-level pattern involve name entity mention particular give output sentence produce baseline ner model replace entity mention textit barack obama entity type textit per result sentence pattern contain direct output information yet less sparse without specific name entity example per bear loc pattern lstm cnn structure utilise learn deep representation sentence reranking result show system significantly improve ner accuracy two different baseline give best reported result standard benchmark
