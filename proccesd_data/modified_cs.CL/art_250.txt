 factorization language model backing-off lattice factorization statistical language model task resolve discriminative model factored model determine new model combine provide good estimate previous work mainly focus factorize model sequential event allow one factorization manner enable parallel factorization allow model event resolve one way time propose general framework adopt backing-off lattice reflect parallel factorization define path along model resolve factored model use mixture model combine parallel path lattice generalize katz 's backing-off method integrate mixture model get traverse entire lattice base framework formulate two type model factorization use natural language modeling
