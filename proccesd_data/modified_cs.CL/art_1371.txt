 end-to-end neural sentence order use pointer network sentence ordering one important task nlp previous work mainly focus improve performance use pair-wise strategy however nontrivial pair-wise model incorporate contextual sentence information addition error prorogation could introduce use pipeline strategy pair-wise model paper propose end-to-end neural approach address sentence order problem use pointer network ptr-net alleviate error propagation problem utilize whole contextual information experimental result show effectiveness propose model source code dataset paper available
