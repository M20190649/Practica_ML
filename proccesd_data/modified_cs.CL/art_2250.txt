 deep neural network czech multi-label document classification paper focus automatic multi-label document classification czech text document current approach usually use pre-processing negative impact loss information additional implementation work etc therefore would like omit use deep neural network learn simple feature choice motivate successful usage many machine learn field two different network compare first one standard multi-layer perceptron second one popular convolutional network experiment czech newspaper corpus show network significantly outperform baseline method use rich set feature maximum entropy classifier also show convolutional network give best result
