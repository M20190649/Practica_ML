 automatically detect self-reported birth defect outcomes twitter large-scale epidemiological research recent work identify study small cohort twitter user whose pregnancy birth defect outcome could observe via publicly available tweet exploit social medium 's large-scale potential complement limited method study birth defect lead cause infant mortality depend development automatic method primary objective study take first step towards scale use social medium observe pregnancy birth defect outcome namely develop method automatically detect tweet user report birth defect outcome annotate pre-processed approximately tweet mention birth defect order train evaluate supervise machine learn algorithm include feature-engineered deep learning-based classifier also experiment various under-sampling over-sampling approach address class imbalance support vector machine svm classifier train original imbalanced data set n-grams word cluster structural feature achieve best baseline performance positive class f -score defect class possible defect class contribution include natural language processing nlp supervise machine learning method automatically detect tweet user report birth defect outcome ii comparison feature-engineered deep learning-based classifier train imbalanced under-sampled over-sampled data iii error analysis could inform classification improvement use publicly available corpus future work focus automate user-level analysis cohort inclusion
