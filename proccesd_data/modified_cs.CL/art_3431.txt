 incorporate discriminator sentence generation gibbs sample method generate plausible fluent sentence desired property long challenge recent work use recurrent neural network rnns variant predict follow word give previous sequence target label paper propose novel framework generate constrained sentence via gibbs sampling candidate sentence revise update iteratively sampled new word replace old one experiment show effectiveness propose method generate plausible diverse sentence
