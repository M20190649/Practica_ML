 neural adaptation layer cross-domain name entity recognition recent research effort show neural architecture effective conventional information extraction task name entity recognition yield state-of-the-art result standard newswire datasets however despite significant resource require training model performance model train one domain typically degrade dramatically apply different domain yet extract entity new emerge domain social medium significant interest paper empirically investigate effective method conveniently adapt exist well-trained neural ner model new domain unlike exist approach propose lightweight yet effective method perform domain adaptation neural model specifically introduce adaptation layer top exist neural architecture re-training use source domain data require conduct extensive empirical study show approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art method
