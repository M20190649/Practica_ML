 gap-based framework chinese word segmentation via deep convolutional network previous approach chinese word segmentation roughly classify character-based word-based method former regard task sequence-labeling problem latter directly segment character sequence word however consider segment give sentence intuitive idea predict whether segment gap two consecutive character comparison make previous approach seem complex therefore paper propose gap-based framework implement intuitive idea moreover deep convolutional neural network namely resnets densenets exploit experiment result show approach outperform best character-based word-based method benchmark without post-processing module e.g conditional random field beam search
