 test generalization power neural network model across nli benchmark neural network model successful natural language inference best model reach accuracy benchmark however success model turn largely benchmark specific show model train natural language inference dataset drawn one benchmark fail perform well others even notion inference assume benchmark similar train six high perform neural network model different datasets show one problem generalize replace original test set test set take another corpus design task light result argue current neural network model able generalize well task natural language inference find use large pre-trained language model help transfer learning datasets similar enough result also highlight current nli datasets cover different nuance inference extensively enough
