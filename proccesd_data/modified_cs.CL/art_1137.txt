 swivel improving embeddings notice 's miss present submatrix-wise vector embed learner swivel method generate low-dimensional feature embeddings feature co-occurrence matrix swivel performs approximate factorization point-wise mutual information matrix via stochastic gradient descent use piecewise loss special handle unobserved co-occurrence thus make use information matrix require computation proportional size entire matrix make use vectorized multiplication process thousand row column compute million predicted value furthermore partition matrix shard order parallelize computation across many node approach result accurate embeddings achieve method consider observed co-occurrence scale much large corpus handle sample method
