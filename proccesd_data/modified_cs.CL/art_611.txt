 mantime temporal expression identification normalization tempeval- challenge paper describe temporal expression identification normalization system mantime develop tempeval- challenge identification phase combine use conditional random field along post-processing identification pipeline whereas normalization phase carry use norma open-source rule-based temporal normalizer investigate performance variation respect different feature type specifically show use wordnet-based feature identification task negatively affect overall performance statistically significant difference use gazetteer shallow parsing propositional noun phrase label top morphological feature test data best run achieve p r f identification phase normalization accuracy type attribute value attribute surprisingly use silver data alone addition gold annotate one improve performance
