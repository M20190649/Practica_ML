 unsupervised text style transfer use language model discriminator binary classifier often employ discriminator gan-based unsupervised style transfer system ensure transferred sentence similar sentence target domain one difficulty approach error signal provide discriminator unstable sometimes insufficient train generator produce fluent language paper propose new technique use target domain language model discriminator provide rich stable token-level feedback learning process train generator minimize negative log likelihood nll generated sentence evaluate language model use continuous approximation discrete sample generator model train use back-propagation end- to-end fashion moreover empirical result show use language model structured discriminator possible forgo adversarial step training make process stable compare model previous work use convolutional neural network cnns discriminator show approach lead improve performance three task word substitution decipherment sentiment modification related language translation
