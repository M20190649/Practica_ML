 byte-level recursive convolutional auto-encoder text article propose auto-encode text byte-level use convolutional network recursive architecture motivation explore whether possible scalable homogeneous text generation byte-level non-sequential fashion simple task auto-encoding show non-sequential text generation fixed-length representation possible also achieve much good auto-encoding result recurrent network propose model multi-stage deep convolutional encoder-decoder framework use residual connection contain parameterized layer encoder decoder contain share group module consist either pooling upsampling layer make network recursive term abstraction level representation result large-scale paragraph datasets report language include arabic chinese english analysis conduct study several property propose model
