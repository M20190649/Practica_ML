 feature-enriched neural model joint chinese word segmentation part-of-speech tagging recently neural network model natural language processing task increasingly focus ability alleviate burden manual feature engineering however previous neural model extract complicated feature composition traditional method discrete feature work propose feature-enriched neural model joint chinese word segmentation part-of-speech tagging task specifically simulate feature templates traditional discrete feature base model use different filter model complex compositional feature convolutional pool layer utilize long distance dependency information recurrent layer experimental result five different datasets show effectiveness propose model
