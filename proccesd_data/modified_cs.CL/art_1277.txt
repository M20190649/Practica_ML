 neural machine translation character hierarchical encode existing neural machine translation model use group character whole word unit input output propose model hierarchical char word encoder take individual character input output first argue hierarchical representation character encoder reduce computational complexity show improve translation performance secondly qualitatively study attention plot decoder find model learn compress common word single embed whereas rare word name place represent character character
