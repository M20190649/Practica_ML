 distant supervision relation extraction beyond sentence boundary grow demand structured knowledge lead great interest relation extraction especially case limited supervision however exist distance supervision approach extract relation express single sentence general cross-sentence relation extraction under-explored even supervised-learning setting paper propose first approach apply distant supervision cross- sentence relation extraction core approach graph representation incorporate standard dependency discourse relation thus provide unifying way model relation within across sentence extract feature multiple path graph increase accuracy robustness confront linguistic variation analysis error experiment important extraction task precision medicine show approach learn accurate cross-sentence extractor use small exist knowledge base unlabeled text biomedical research article compare exist distant supervision paradigm approach extract twice many relation similar precision thus demonstrate prevalence cross-sentence relation promise approach
