 end-to-end adversarial learning generative conversational agent paper present new adversarial learning method generative conversational agent gca besides new model gca similar previous work adversarial learning dialogue generation method assume gca generator aim fool discriminator label dialogue human-generated machine-generated however approach discriminator perform token-level classification i.e indicate whether current token generate human machine discriminator also receive context utterances dialogue history incomplete answer current token input new approach make possible end-to-end training backpropagation self-conversation process enables produce set generate data diversity adversarial training approach improve performance question relate training data experimental result human adversarial evaluation show adversarial method yield significant performance gain usual teacher force training
