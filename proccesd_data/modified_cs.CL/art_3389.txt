 sentence boundary detection french subword-level information vector convolutional neural network work tackle problem sentence boundary detection apply french binary classification task sentence boundary sentence boundary combine convolutional neural network subword-level information vector word embed representation learn wikipedia take advantage word morphology word represent bag character n-grams decide use big write dataset french gigaword instead standard size transcription train evaluate propose architecture intention use trained model posterior real life asr transcription three different architecture test show similar result general accuracy model overpass three model good f score reach value regard sentence boundary class however sentence boundary class reflect low score decrease f metric one model use subword-level information vector seem effective lead conclude morphology word encode embeddings representation behave like pixel image making feasible use convolutional neural network architecture
