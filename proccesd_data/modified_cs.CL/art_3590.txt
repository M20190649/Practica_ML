 guide neural machine translation retrieved translation piece one difficulty neural machine translation nmt recall appropriate translation low-frequency word phrase paper propose simple fast effective method recall previously see translation example incorporate nmt decoding process specifically input sentence use search engine retrieve sentence pair whose source side similar input sentence collect n -grams retrieved target sentence align word match source sentence call translation piece compute pseudo-probabilities retrieve sentence base similarity input sentence retrieve source sentence use weight retrieved translation piece finally exist nmt model use translate input sentence additional bonus give output contain collected translation piece show method improve nmt translation result bleu point three narrow domain translation task repetitiveness target sentence particularly salient also cause little increase translation time compare favorably another alternative retrieval-based method respect accuracy speed simplicity implementation
