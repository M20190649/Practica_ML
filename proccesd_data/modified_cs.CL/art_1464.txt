 improve text classification vector reduced precision paper present analysis impact floating-point number precision reduction quality text classification precision reduction vector represent data e.g tf-idf representation case allow decrease compute time memory footprint dedicate hardware platform impact precision reduction classification quality perform corpus use different classifier also dimensionality reduction take account result indicate precision reduction improve classification accuracy case error reduction general reduction bit give best score ensure result bad full floating-point representation
