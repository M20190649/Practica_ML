 s-net multi-modal similarity metric learning base deep convolutional network answer selection recent work use artificial neural network base distributed word representation greatly boost performance various natural language processing task especially answer selection problem nevertheless previous work use deep learn method like lstm-rnn cnn etc capture semantic representation sentence separately without consider interdependence paper propose novel end-to-end learning framework constitute deep convolutional neural network base multi-modal similarity metric learn s-net pairwise token propose model demonstrate performance surpass previous state-of-the-art system answer selection benchmark i.e. trec-qa dataset map mrr metric
