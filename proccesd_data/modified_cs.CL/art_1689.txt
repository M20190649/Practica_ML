 improve evaluation fluency use entropy machine translation evaluation metrics widely-used automatic evaluation metric adequately reflect fluency translation n-gram-based metric like bleu limit maximum length matched fragment n catch matched fragment longer n reflect fluency indirectly meteor limit n-gram use number matched chunk consider length chunk paper propose entropy-based method sufficiently reflect fluency translation distribution matched word method easily combine widely-used automatic evaluation metric improve evaluation fluency experiment show correlation bleu meteor improve sentence level combine entropy-based method wmt wmt
