 siamese neural network random forest detect duplicate question pair determine whether two give question semantically similar fairly challenging task give different structure form question take paper use gated recurrent unit gru combination highly use machine learn algorithm like random forest adaboost svm similarity prediction task dataset release quora consist k label question pair get best result use siamese adaptation bidirectional gru random forest classifier land u among top competition quora question pair host kaggle
