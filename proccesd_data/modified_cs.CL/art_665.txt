 domain-specific sentiment word extraction seed expansion pattern generation paper focus automatic extraction domain-specific sentiment word dssw fundamental subtask sentiment analysis previous work utilizes manual pattern task however performance method highly relies labelled pattern select seed order overcome problem paper present automatic framework detect large-scale domain-specific pattern dssw extraction end sentiment seed extract massive dataset user comment subsequently sentiment seed expand synonym use bootstrapping mechanism simultaneously synonymy graph build graph propagation algorithm apply build synonymy graph afterwards syntactic sequential relation target word high-ranked sentiment word extract automatically construct large-scale pattern use extracte dssws experimental result three domain reveal effectiveness method
