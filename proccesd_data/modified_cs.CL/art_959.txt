 statistical machine translation feature multitask tensor network present three-pronged approach improve statistical machine translation smt building recent success application neural network smt first propose new feature base neural network model various non-local translation phenomenon second augment architecture neural network tensor layer capture important higher-order interaction among network unit third apply multitask learning estimate neural network parameter jointly propose method result significant improvement complementary overall improvement bleu point arabic-english chinese-english translation state-of-the-art system already include neural network feature
