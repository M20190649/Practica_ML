 restriction tree adjoin language several method know parse language generate tree adjoin grammar tag n bad case run time paper investigate restriction tag tag derivation need order lower n time complexity without introduce large runtime constant without lose generative power need capture syntactic construction natural language handle unrestricted tag particular describe algorithm parse strict subclass tag n attempt show subclass retain enough generative power make useful general case
