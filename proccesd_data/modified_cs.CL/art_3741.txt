 unsupervised neural machine translation weight share unsupervised neural machine translation nmt recently propose approach machine translation aim train model without use label data model propose unsupervised nmt often use one share encoder map pair sentence different language shared-latent space weak keep unique internal characteristic language style terminology sentence structure address issue introduce extension utilize two independent encoders share partial weight responsible extract high-level representation input sentence besides two different generative adversarial network gans namely local gan global gan propose enhance cross-language translation new approach achieve significant improvement english-german english-french chinese-to-english translation task
