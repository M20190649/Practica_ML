 deep reinforced model abstractive summarization attentional rnn-based encoder-decoder model abstractive summarization achieve good performance short input output sequence long document summary however model often include repetitive incoherent phrase introduce neural network model novel intra-attention attend input continuously generate output separately new training method combine standard supervise word prediction reinforcement learning rl model train supervise learn often exhibit exposure bias assume ground truth provide step training however standard word prediction combine global sequence prediction training rl result summary become readable evaluate model cnn daily mail new york time datasets model obtain rouge- score cnn daily mail dataset improvement previous state-of-the-art model human evaluation also show model produce high quality summary
