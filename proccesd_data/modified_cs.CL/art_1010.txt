 discriminative segmental cascade feature-rich phone recognition discriminative segmental model segmental conditional random field scrfs segmental structure support vector machine ssvms success speech recognition via lattice rescoring first-pass decoding however model suffer slow decoding hamper use computationally expensive feature segment neural network high-order feature typical solution use approximate decoding either beam pruning single pas beam pruning generate lattice follow second pas work study discriminative segmental model train hinge loss i.e. segmental structure svms show beam search suitable learn rescoring model approach though give good approximate decode performance model already well-trained instead consider approach inspire structured prediction cascade use max-marginal pruning generate lattice obtain high-accuracy phonetic recognition system several expensive feature type segment neural network second-order language model second-order phone boundary feature
