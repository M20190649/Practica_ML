 expand subjective lexicon social medium mine embed subspace recent approach sentiment lexicon induction capitalize pre-trained word embeddings capture latent semantic property however embeddings obtain optimize performance give task e.g predict contextual word sub-optimal application paper address problem exploit task-specific representation induce via embed sub-space projection allow u expand lexicon describe multiple semantic property property model jointly learn suitable representation concomitant predictor experiment conduct multiple subjective lexicon show model outperform previous work baseline even low training data regime furthermore lexicon-based sentiment classifier build top lexicon outperform similar resource yield performance comparable supervised model
