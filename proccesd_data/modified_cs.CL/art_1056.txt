 deep convolutional acoustic word embeddings use word-pair side information recent study revisit whole word basic modelling unit speech recognition query application instead phonetic unit whole-word segmental system rely function map variable-length speech segment vector fixed-dimensional space result acoustic word embeddings need allow accurate discrimination different word type directly embedding space compare several old new approach word discrimination task best approach use side information form know word pair train siamese convolutional neural network cnn pair tied network take two speech segment input produce embeddings train hinge loss separate same-word pair different-word pair margin word classifier cnn performs similarly require much strong supervision type cnns yield large improvement best previously publish result word discrimination task
