 generate good word embedding analyze three critical component word embed training model corpus training parameter systematize exist neural-network-based word embed algorithm compare use corpus evaluate word embed three way analyze semantic property use feature supervised task use initialize neural network also provide several simple guideline train word embeddings first discover corpus domain important corpus size recommend choose corpus suitable domain desired task use large corpus yield good result second find fast model provide sufficient performance case complex model use training corpus sufficiently large third early stopping metric iterate rely development set desired task rather validation loss train embed
