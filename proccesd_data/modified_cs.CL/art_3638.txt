 pre-trained word embeddings useful neural machine translation performance neural machine translation nmt system often suffer low-resource scenario sufficiently large-scale parallel corpus obtain pre-trained word embeddings prove invaluable improve performance natural language analysis task often suffer paucity data however utility nmt extensively explore work perform five set experiment analyze expect pre-trained word embeddings help nmt task show embeddings surprisingly effective case -- provide gain bleu point favorable setting
