 coherence modeling asynchronous conversation neural entity grid approach propose novel coherence model write asynchronous conversation e.g. forum email show application coherence assessment thread reconstruction task conduct research two step first propose improvement recently propose neural entity grid model lexicalize entity transition extend model asynchronous conversation incorporate underlying conversational structure entity grid representation feature computation model achieve state art result standard coherence assessment task monologue conversation outperform exist model also demonstrate effectiveness reconstruct thread structure
