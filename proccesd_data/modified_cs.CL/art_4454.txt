 improve result string kernel sentiment analysis arabic dialect identification adapt test set recently string kernel obtain state-of-the-art result various text classification task arabic dialect identification native language identification paper apply two simple yet effective transductive learning approach improve result string kernel first approach base interpret pairwise string kernel similarity sample training set sample test set feature second approach simple self-training method base two learning iteration first iteration classifier train training set test test set usual second iteration number test sample classifier associate high confidence score add training set another round training however ground-truth label added test sample necessary instead use label predict classifier first training iteration adapt string kernel test set report significantly good accuracy rate english polarity classification arabic dialect identification
