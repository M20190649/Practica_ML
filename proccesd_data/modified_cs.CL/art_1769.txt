 attentive neural architecture fine-grained entity type classification work propose novel attention-based neural network model task fine-grained entity type classification unlike previously propose model recursively compose representation entity mention context model achieve state-of-the-art performance loose micro f -score well-established figer dataset relative improvement also investigate behavior attention mechanism model observe learn contextual linguistic expression indicate fine-grained category membership entity
