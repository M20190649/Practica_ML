 reduce bias production speech model replace hand-engineered pipeline end-to-end deep learning system enable strong result application like speech object recognition however causality latency constraint production system put end-to-end speech model back underfitting regime expose bias model show overcome scale i.e. train big model data work systematically identify address source bias reduce error rate remain practical deployment achieve utilize improved neural architecture stream inference solve optimization issue employ strategy increase audio label modelling versatility
