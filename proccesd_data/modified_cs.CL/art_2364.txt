 residual convolutional ctc network automatic speech recognition deep learning approach widely use automatic speech recognition asr achieve significant accuracy improvement especially convolutional neural network cnns revisit asr recently however cnns use exist work less layer may deep enough capture human speech signal information paper propose novel deep wide cnn architecture denote rcnn-ctc residual connection connectionist temporal classification ctc loss function rcnn-ctc end-to-end system exploit temporal spectral structure speech signal simultaneously furthermore introduce ctc-based system combination different conventional frame-wise senone-based one basic subsystem adopt combination different type thus mutually complementary experimental result show propose single system rcnn-ctc achieve low word error rate wer wsj tencent chat data set compare several widely use neural network system asr addition propose system combination offer error reduction two data set result relative wer reduction wsj dev tencent chat data set respectively
