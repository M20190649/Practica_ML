 coordinate system selection minimum error rate training statistical machine translation minimum error rate training mert widely use training procedure statistical machine translation general problem approach search space easy converge local optimum acquired weight set accord real distribution feature function paper introduce coordinate system selection r search algorithm mert contrary previous approach every dimension correspond one independent feature function create several coordinate system move one dimension new direction basic idea quite simple critical training procedure mert base coordinate system form search direction directly feature function experiment show select coordinate system tune set result good result obtain without language knowledge
