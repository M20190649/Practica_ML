 semi-supervised clustering short text via deep representation learning work propose semi-supervised method short text clustering represent texts distribute vector neural network use small amount label data specify intention cluster design novel objective combine representation learn process k-means cluster process together optimize objective label data unlabeled data iteratively convergence three step assign short text near centroid base representation current neural network re-estimate cluster centroid base cluster assignment step update neural network accord objective keep centroid cluster assignment fix experimental result four datasets show method work significantly good several text cluster method
