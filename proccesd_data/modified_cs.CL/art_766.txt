 radical-enhanced chinese character embed present method leverage radical learn chinese character embedding radical semantic phonetic component chinese character play important role character radical usually similar semantic meaning grammatical usage however exist chinese processing algorithm typically regard word character basic unit ignore crucial radical information paper fill gap leverage radical learn continuous representation chinese character develop dedicated neural architecture effectively learn character embed apply chinese character similarity judgement chinese word segmentation experiment result show radical-enhanced method outperforms exist embed learn algorithm task
