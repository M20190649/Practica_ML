 refine raw sentence representation textual entailment recognition via attention paper present model use team rivercorners repeval share task first model separately encode pair sentence variable-length representation use bidirectional lstm later create fixed-length raw representation mean simple aggregation function refine use attention mechanism finally combine refined representation sentence single vector use classification model obtain test accuracy matched mismatched evaluation track respectively outperform lstm baseline obtain performance similar model rely share information sentence esim use ensemble accuracy increase respectively
