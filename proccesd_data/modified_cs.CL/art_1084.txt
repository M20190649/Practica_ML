 unified tagging solution bidirectional lstm recurrent neural network word embed bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network blstm-rnn show effective model predict sequential data e.g speech utterance handwritten document study propose use blstm-rnn unified tagging solution apply various tag task include part-of-speech tagging chunk name entity recognition instead exploit specific feature carefully optimize task solution use one set task-independent feature internal representation learn unlabeled text tasks.requiring task specific knowledge sophisticated feature engineering approach get nearly state-of-the-art performance three tag task
