 adversarial propagation zero-shot cross-lingual transfer word vector specialization semantic specialization process fine-tuning pre-trained distributional word vector use external lexical knowledge e.g. wordnet accentuate particular semantic relation specialized vector space post-processing specialization method applicable arbitrary distributional vector limited update vector word occur external lexicon i.e. see word leave vector word unchanged propose novel approach specialize full distributional vocabulary adversarial post-specialization method propagate external lexical knowledge full distributional space exploit word see resource training example learn global specialization function function learn combine standard l -distance loss adversarial loss adversarial component produce realistic output vector show effectiveness robustness propose method across three language three task word similarity dialog state tracking lexical simplification report consistent improvement distributional word vector vector specialize state-of-the-art specialization framework finally also propose cross-lingual transfer method zero-shot specialization successfully specialize full target distributional space without lexical knowledge target language without bilingual data
