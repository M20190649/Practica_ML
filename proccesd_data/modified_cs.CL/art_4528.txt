 multi-reference training pseudo-references neural translation text generation neural text generation include neural machine translation image captioning summarization quite successful recently however training time typically one reference consider example even though often multiple reference available e.g. reference nist mt evaluation reference image captioning data first investigate several different way utilize multiple human reference training importantly propose algorithm generate exponentially many pseudo-references first compress exist human reference lattice traverse generate new pseudo-references approach lead substantial improvement strong baseline machine translation bleu image captioning bleu cider
