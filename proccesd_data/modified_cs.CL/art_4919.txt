 learn discriminate noise incorporate external information neural machine translation previous study show incorporate external information could improve translation quality neural machine translation nmt system however inevitably noise external information severely reduce benefit exist method could receive incorporation tackle problem study pay special attention discrimination noise incorporation argue exist two kind noise external information i.e global noise local noise affect translation whole sentence specific word respectively accordingly propose general framework learn jointly discriminate global local noise external information could good leverage model train dataset derive original parallel corpus without external label data annotation experimental result various real-world scenario language pair neural architecture indicate discriminate noise contributes significant improvement translation quality able well incorporate external information even noisy condition
