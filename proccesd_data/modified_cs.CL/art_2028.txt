 temporal attention model neural machine translation attention-based neural machine translation nmt model suffer attention deficiency issue observe recent research propose novel mechanism address limitation improve nmt attention specifically approach memorize alignment temporally within sentence modulate attention accumulated temporal memory decoder generate candidate translation compare approach baseline nmt model two related approach address issue either explicitly implicitly large-scale experiment two language pair show approach achieve well robust gain baseline related nmt approach model outperform strong smt baseline setting even without use ensemble
