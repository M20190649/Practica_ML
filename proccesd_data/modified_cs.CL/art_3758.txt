 subword regularization improve neural network translation model multiple subword candidate subword unit effective way alleviate open vocabulary problem neural machine translation nmt sentence usually convert unique subword sequence subword segmentation potentially ambiguous multiple segmentation possible even vocabulary question address paper whether possible harness segmentation ambiguity noise improve robustness nmt present simple regularization method subword regularization train model multiple subword segmentation probabilistically sample training addition good subword sampling propose new subword segmentation algorithm base unigram language model experiment multiple corpus report consistent improvement especially low resource out-of-domain setting
