 one ruler language multi-lingual dialogue evaluation adversarial multi-task learn automatic evaluate performance open-domain dialogue system challenging problem recent work neural network-based metric show promising opportunity automatic dialogue evaluation however exist method mainly focus monolingual evaluation trained metric flexible enough transfer across different language address issue propose adversarial multi-task neural metric advmt multi-lingual dialogue evaluation share feature extraction across language evaluate propose model two different language experiment show adversarial multi-task neural metric achieve high correlation human annotation yield good performance monolingual one various exist metric
