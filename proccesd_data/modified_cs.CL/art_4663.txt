 depth-bounding effective improvement evaluation unsupervised pcfg induction several recent attempt improve accuracy grammar induction system bound recursive complexity induction model ponvert et al. noji johnson shain et al. jin et al. modern depth-bounded grammar inducer show accurate early unbounded pcfg inducer technique never compare unbounded induction within system part previous depth-bounding model build around sequence model complexity grow exponentially maximum allow depth present work instead apply depth bound within chart-based bayesian pcfg inducer johnson et al. b bounding switch sample tree without bound result show depth-bounding indeed significantly effective limit search space inducer thereby increase accuracy result parsing model moreover parse result english chinese german show bound model new inference technique able produce parse tree accurately competitively state-of-the-art constituency-based grammar induction model
