 adaptive semi-supervised learning cross-domain sentiment classification consider cross-domain sentiment classification problem sentiment classifier learn source domain generalize target domain approach explicitly minimize distance source target instance embedded feature space difference source target minimize exploit additional information target domain consolidate idea semi-supervised learning jointly employ two regularization -- entropy minimization self-ensemble bootstrapping -- incorporate unlabeled target data classifier refinement experimental result demonstrate propose approach better leverage unlabeled data target domain achieve substantial improvement baseline method various experimental setting
