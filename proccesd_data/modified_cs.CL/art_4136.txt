 evaluation sentence embeddings downstream linguistic probing task despite fast developmental pace new sentence embed method still challenge find comprehensive evaluation different technique past year saw significant improvement field sentence embeddings especially towards development universal sentence encoders could provide inductive transfer wide variety downstream task work perform comprehensive evaluation recent method use wide variety downstream linguistic feature probe task show simple approach use bag-of-words recently introduce language model deep context-dependent word embeddings prove yield good result many task compare sentence encoders train entailment datasets also show however still far away universal encoder perform consistently across several downstream task
