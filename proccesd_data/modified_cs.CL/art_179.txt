 transformation-based learning fast lane transformation-based learning successfully employ solve many natural language processing problem achieve state-of-the-art performance many natural language processing task overtrain easily however serious drawback training time often intorelably long especially large corpus often use nlp paper present novel realistic method speed training time transformation-based learner without sacrifice performance paper compare contrast training time need performance achieve modified learner two system standard transformation-based learner ica system cite hepple tbl result experiment show system able achieve significant improvement training time still achieve performance standard transformation-based learner valuable contribution system algorithm utilize transformation-based learning part execution
