 accelerate reinforcement learn sentence generation vocabulary prediction major obstacle reinforcement learning-based sentence generation large action space whose size equal vocabulary size target-side language improve efficiency reinforcement learning present novel approach reduce action space base dynamic vocabulary prediction method first predict fixed-size small vocabulary input generate target sentence input-specific vocabulary use supervised reinforcement learn step also test time experiment six machine translation two image caption datasets method achieves faster reinforcement learn sim x faster less gpu memory sim x less full-vocabulary counterpart reinforcement learn method consistently lead significant improvement bleu score score equal good baseline use full vocabulary faster decode time sim x faster cpu
