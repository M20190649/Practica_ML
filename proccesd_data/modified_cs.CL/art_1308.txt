 rnn approach text normalization challenge paper present challenge community give large corpus write text align normalized spoken form train rnn learn correct normalization function present data set general text normalization generate use exist text normalization component text-to-speech system data set release open-source near future also present experiment data set variety different rnn architecture architecture fact produce good result measure term overall accuracy error produce problematic since would convey completely wrong message system deploy speech application hand show simple fst-based filter mitigate error achieve level accuracy achievable rnn alone though conclusion largely negative point actually argue text normalization problem intractable use pure rnn approach merely go something solve merely huge amount annotated text data feed general rnn model open-source data provide novel data set sequence-to-sequence modeling hope community find good solution data use work release available http github.com rwsproat text-normalization-data
