 inducing embed sens scaled gumbel softmax method learn word sense embeddings represent single word multiple sense-specific vector method produce interpretable sense embeddings also learn select sense use give context propose unsupervised model learn sense embeddings use modified gumbel softmax function allow differentiable discrete sense selection model produce sense embeddings competitive sometimes state art multiple similarity base downstream evaluation however performance downstream evaluation task correlate interpretability sense embeddings discover interpretability comparison compete multi-sense embeddings many previous approach perform well downstream evaluation produce interpretable embeddings learn duplicate sense group method achieve best world
