 variational semi-supervised aspect-term sentiment analysis via transformer aspect-term sentiment analysis atsa longstanding challenge natural language understanding require fine-grained semantical reason target entity appear text manual annotation aspect laborious time-consuming amount label data limit supervised learning paper propose semi-supervised method atsa problem use variational autoencoder base transformer vaet model latent distribution via variational inference disentangle latent representation aspect-specific sentiment lexical context method induce underlying sentiment prediction unlabeled data benefit atsa classifier method classifier agnostic i.e. classifier independent module various advanced supervise model integrate experimental result obtain semeval task show method effective four classical classifier propose method outperform two general semisupervised method achieve state-of-the-art performance
