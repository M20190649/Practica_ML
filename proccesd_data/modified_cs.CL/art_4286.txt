 concurrent learning semantic relation discover whether word semantically relate identify specific semantic relation hold crucial importance nlp essential task like query expansion ir within context different methodology propose either exclusively focus single lexical relation e.g hypernymy vs. random learn specific classifier capable identify multiple semantic relation e.g hypernymy vs. synonymy vs. random paper propose another way look problem rely multi-task learning paradigm particular want study whether learn process give semantic relation e.g hypernymy improve concurrent learning another semantic relation e.g co-hyponymy within context particularly examine benefit semi-supervised learning training prediction function perform label data jointly many unlabeled one preliminary result base simple learning strategy state-of-the-art distributional feature representation show concurrent learning lead improvement vast majority tested situation
