 multi-source syntactic neural machine translation introduce novel multi-source technique incorporate source syntax neural machine translation use linearized par achieve employ separate encoders sequential parsed version source sentence resulting representation combine use hierarchical attention mechanism propose model improve seq seq parse baseline bleu wmt english-german task analysis show multi-source syntactic model able translate successfully without parsed input unlike standard parse method addition performance deteriorate much long sentence baseline
