 convolutional network need deep text classification study work importance depth convolutional model text classification either character word input consider show standard text classification sentiment analysis task deep model indeed give good performance shallow network text input represent sequence character however simple shallow-and-wide network outperforms deep model densenet word input shallow word model establish new state-of-the-art performance two datasets yelp binary yelp full
