 neural multi-source morphological reinflection explore task multi-source morphological reinflection generalize standard single-source version input consist target tag ii multiple pair source form source tag lemma motivation beneficial access one source form since different source form provide complementary information e.g. different stem present novel extension encoder- decoder recurrent neural architecture consist multiple encoders well solve task show new architecture outperform single-source reinflection model publish dataset multi-source morphological reinflection facilitate future research
