 efficient segmental cascade speech recognition discriminative segmental model offer way incorporate flexible feature function speech recognition however appeal limit computational requirement due large number possible segment consider multi-pass cascade segmental model introduce feature increase complexity different pass pas segmental model rescores lattice produce previous simpler segmental model paper explore several way make segmental cascade efficient practical reduce feature set first pas frame subsampling various prune approach experiment phonetic recognition find combination technique possible maintain competitive performance greatly reduce decode pruning training time
