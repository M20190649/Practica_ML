 stable effective learning strategy trainable greedy decode beam search widely use approximate search strategy neural network decoder generally outperform simple greedy decode task like machine translation however improvement come substantial computational cost paper propose flexible new method allow u reap nearly full benefit beam search nearly additional computational cost method revolve around small neural network actor train observe manipulate hidden state previously-trained decoder train actor network introduce use pseudo-parallel corpus build use output beam search base model rank target quality metric like bleu method inspire early work problem require reinforcement learning train reliably range model experiment three parallel corpus three architecture show method yield substantial improvement translation quality speed base system
