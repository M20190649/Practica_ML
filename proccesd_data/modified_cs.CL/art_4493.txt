 disfluency detection use auto-correlational neural network recent year natural language processing community move away task-specific feature engineering i.e. researcher discover ad-hoc feature representation various task favor general-purpose method learn input representation however state-of-the-art approach disfluency detection spontaneous speech transcript currently still depend array hand-crafted feature representation derive output pre-existing system language model dependency parser alternative paper propose simple yet effective model automatic disfluency detection call auto-correlational neural network acnn model use convolutional neural network cnn augments new auto-correlation operator low layer capture kind rough copy dependency characteristic repair disfluency speech experiment acnn model outperform baseline cnn disfluency detection task increase f-score close previous best result task
