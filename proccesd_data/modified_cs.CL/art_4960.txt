 graphie graph-based framework information extraction modern information extraction ie system implement sequential tagger model local dependency non-local non-sequential context however valuable source information improve prediction paper introduce graphie framework operate graph represent broad set dependency textual unit i.e word sentence algorithm propagate information connect node graph convolution generate rich representation exploit improve word-level prediction evaluation three different task -- namely textual social medium visual information extraction -- show graphie consistently outperform state-of-the-art sequence tag model significant margin
