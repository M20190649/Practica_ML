 low-dimensional embeddings interpretable anchor-based topic inference anchor word algorithm performs provably efficient topic model inference find approximate convex hull high-dimensional word co-occurrence space however exist greedy algorithm often select poor anchor word reduce topic quality interpretability rather find approximate convex hull high-dimensional space propose find exact convex hull visualizable -dimensional space low-dimensional embeddings improve topic clearly show user algorithm select certain word
