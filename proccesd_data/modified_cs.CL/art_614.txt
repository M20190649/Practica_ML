 binary tree base chinese word segmentation chinese word segmentation fundamental task chinese language processing granularity mismatch problem main cause error paper show binary tree representation store output different granularity binary tree base framework also design overcome granularity mismatch problem two step framework namely tree building tree pruning tree prune step specially design focus granularity problem previous work chinese word segmentation sequence tagging easily employ framework framework also provide quantitative error analysis method experiment show use sophisticated tree prune function state-of-the-art conditional random field base baseline error reduction
