 morphological prior probabilistic neural word embeddings word embeddings allow natural language process system share statistical information across related word embeddings typically base distributional statistic make difficult generalize rare unseen word propose improve word embeddings incorporate morphological information capture share sub-word feature unlike previous work construct word embeddings directly morpheme combine morphological distributional information unified probabilistic framework word embedding latent variable morphological information provide prior distribution latent word embeddings turn condition likelihood function observed corpus approach yield improvement intrinsic word similarity evaluation also downstream task part-of-speech tagging
