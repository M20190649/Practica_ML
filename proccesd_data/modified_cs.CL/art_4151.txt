 multi-layer ensembling technique multilingual intent classification paper determine multi-layer ensembling improve performance multilingual intent classification develop novel multi-layer ensembling approach ensembles different model initialization different model architecture also introduce new banking domain dataset compare result standard atis dataset chinese smp dataset determine ensembling performance multilingual multi-domain context run ensemble experiment across three datasets conclude ensembling provide significant performance increase multi-layer ensembling no-risk way improve performance intent classification also find diverse ensemble simple model reach perform comparable much sophisticated state-of-the-art model best f score atis banking smp respectively compare well state-of-the-art atis best submission smp competition total ensembling performance increase achieve f respectively
