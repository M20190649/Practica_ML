 dependency sensitive convolutional neural network model sentence document goal sentence document modeling accurately represent meaning sentence document various natural language processing task work present dependency sensitive convolutional neural network dscnn general-purpose classification system sentence document dscnn hierarchically build textual representation process pretrained word embeddings via long short-term memory network subsequently extract feature convolution operator compare exist recursive neural model tree structure dscnn rely parser expensive phrase labeling thus restrict sentence-level task moreover unlike cnn-based model analyze sentence locally slide window system capture dependency information within sentence relationship across sentence document experiment result demonstrate approach achieve state-of-the-art performance several task include sentiment analysis question type classification subjectivity classification
