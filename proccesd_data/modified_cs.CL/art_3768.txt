 nugget proposal network chinese event detection neural network base model commonly regard event detection word-wise classification task suffer mismatch problem word event trigger especially language without natural word delimiters chinese paper propose nugget proposal network npns solve word-trigger mismatch problem directly propose entire trigger nugget center character regardless word boundary specifically npns perform event detection character-wise paradigm hybrid representation character first learn capture structural semantic information character word base learned representation trigger nugget propose categorize exploit character compositional structure chinese event trigger experiment ace tac kbp datasets show npns significantly outperform state-of-the-art method
