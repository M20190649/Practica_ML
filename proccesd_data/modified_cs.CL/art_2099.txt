 enhance lstm natural language inference reasoning inference central human artificial intelligence model inference human language challenging availability large annotate data bowman et al. recently become feasible train neural network base inference model show effective paper present new state-of-the-art result achieve accuracy stanford natural language inference dataset unlike previous top model use complicate network architecture first demonstrate carefully design sequential inference model base chain lstms outperform previous model base show explicitly consider recursive architecture local inference modeling inference composition achieve additional improvement particularly incorporate syntactic parse information contributes best result -- -it improve performance even add already strong model
