 end-to-end goal-oriented dialog system generative natural language response generation recently advancements deep learning allow development end-to-end trained goal-oriented dialog system although system already achieve good performance simplification limit usage real-life scenario work address two limitation ignore positional information fixed number possible response candidate propose use positional encoding input model word order user utterance furthermore use feedforward neural network able generate output word word longer restrict fixed number possible response candidate use positional encoding able achieve good accuracy dialog babi task use feedforward neural network generate response able save computation time space consumption
