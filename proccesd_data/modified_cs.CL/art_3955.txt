 robust distant supervision relation extraction via deep reinforcement learn distant supervision become standard method relation extraction however even though efficient method come cost -- -the result distantly-supervised training sample often noisy combat noise recent state-of-the-art approach focus select one-best sentence calculate soft attention weight set sentence one specific entity pair however method suboptimal false positive problem still key stumbling bottleneck performance argue incorrectly-labeled candidate sentence must treat hard decision rather dealt soft attention weight paper describe radical solution -- -we explore deep reinforcement learn strategy generate false-positive indicator automatically recognize false positive relation type without supervised information unlike removal operation previous study redistribute negative example experimental result show propose strategy significantly improve performance distant supervision compare state-of-the-art system
