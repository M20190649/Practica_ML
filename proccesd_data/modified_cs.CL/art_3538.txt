 self-attentional acoustic model self-attention method encode sequence vector relate vector each-other base pairwise similarity model recently show promising result model discrete sequence non-trivial apply acoustic modeling due computational model issue paper apply self-attention acoustic modeling propose several improvement mitigate issue first self-attention memory grows quadratically sequence length address downsampling technique second find previous approach incorporate position information model unsuitable explore representation hybrid model end third stress importance local context acoustic signal propose gaussian biasing approach allow explicit control context range experiment find model approach strong baseline base lstms network-in-network connection much fast compute besides speed find interpretability strength self-attentional acoustic model demonstrate self-attention head learn linguistically plausible division labor
