 new recurrent neural crf learn non-linear edge feature conditional random field crf recurrent neural model achieve success structured prediction recently marriage crf recurrent neural model gain non-linear dense feature globally normalized crf objective recurrent neural crf model mainly focus encode node feature crf undirected graph however edge feature prove important crf structured prediction work introduce new recurrent neural crf model learn non-linear edge feature thus make non-linear feature encode completely compare model different neural model well-known structured prediction task experiment show model outperform state-of-the-art method np chunking shallow parsing chinese word segmentation po tagging
