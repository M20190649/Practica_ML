 simpler context-dependent logical form via model projection consider task learn context-dependent mapping utterance denotation denotation training time must search combinatorially large space logical form even large context-dependent utterance cope challenge perform successive projection full model onto simpler model operate equivalence class logical form though less expressive find simple model much faster surprisingly effective moreover use bootstrap full model finally collect three new context-dependent semantic parsing datasets develop new left-to-right parser
