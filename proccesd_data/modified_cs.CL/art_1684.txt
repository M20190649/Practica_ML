 bidirectional lstm-crf model sequence tagging paper propose variety long short-term memory lstm base model sequence tagging model include lstm network bidirectional lstm bi-lstm network lstm conditional random field crf layer lstm-crf bidirectional lstm crf layer bi-lstm-crf work first apply bidirectional lstm crf denote bi-lstm-crf model nlp benchmark sequence tag data set show bi-lstm-crf model efficiently use past future input feature thanks bidirectional lstm component also use sentence level tag information thanks crf layer bi-lstm-crf model produce state art close accuracy po chunk ner data set addition robust less dependence word embedding compare previous observation
