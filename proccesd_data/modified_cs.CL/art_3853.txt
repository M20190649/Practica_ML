 coarse-to-fine decoding neural semantic parsing semantic parsing aim map natural language utterance structured meaning representation work propose structure-aware neural architecture decompose semantic parsing process two stage give input utterance first generate rough sketch meaning low-level information variable name argument gloss fill miss detail take account natural language input sketch experimental result four datasets characteristic different domain mean representation show approach consistently improve performance achieve competitive result despite use relatively simple decoder
