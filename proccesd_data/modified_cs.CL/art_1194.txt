 improve hypernymy detection integrate path-based distributional method detect hypernymy relation key task nlp address literature use two complementary approach distributional method whose supervised variant current best performer path-based method receive less research attention suggest improved path-based algorithm dependency path encode use recurrent neural network achieve result comparable distributional method extend approach integrate path-based distributional signal significantly improve upon state-of-the-art task
