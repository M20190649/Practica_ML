 zero-resource translation multi-lingual neural machine translation paper propose novel finetuning algorithm recently introduce multi-way mulitlingual neural machine translate enable zero-resource machine translation use together novel many-to-one translation strategy empirically show finetuning algorithm allow multi-way multilingual model translate zero-resource language pair well single-pair neural translation model train direct parallel sentence language pair good pivot-based translation strategy keep one additional copy attention-related parameter
