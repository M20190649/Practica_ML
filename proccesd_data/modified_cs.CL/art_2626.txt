 arc-swift novel transition system dependency parse transition-based dependency parser often need sequence local shift reduce operation produce certain attachment correct individual decision hence require global information sentence context mistake cause error propagation paper propose novel transition system arc-swift enable direct attachment token farther apart single transition allow parser leverage lexical information directly transition decision hence arc-swift achieve significantly good performance small beam size parser reduce error -- relative use exist transition system penn treebank dependency parse task english universal dependency
