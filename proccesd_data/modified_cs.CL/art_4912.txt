 neural transition-based syntactic linearization task linearization find grammatical order give set word traditional model use statistical method syntactic linearization system generate sentence along syntactic tree show state-of-the-art performance recent work show multi-layer lstm language model outperforms competitive statistical syntactic linearization system without use syntax paper study neural syntactic linearization build transition-based syntactic linearizer leverage feed-forward neural network observe significantly well result compare lstm language model task
