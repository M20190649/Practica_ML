 hungarian layer logic empower neural architecture neural architecture purely numeric framework fit data continuous function however lack logic flow e.g textit traditional algorithm e.g textit hungarian algorithm searching decision tress algorithm could embed paradigm limit theory application paper reform calculus graph dynamic process guide logic flow within novel methodology traditional algorithm could empower numerical neural network specifically regard subject sentence matching reformulate issue form task-assignment solve hungarian algorithm first model apply bilstm parse sentence hungarian layer align matching position last transform matching result soft-max regression another bilstm extensive experiment show model outperform state-of-the-art baseline substantially
