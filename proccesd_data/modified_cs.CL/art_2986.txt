 semi-supervised instance population ontology use word vector embeddings many modern day system information extraction knowledge management agent ontology play vital role maintain concept hierarchy select domain however ontology population become problematic process due nature heavy couple manual human intervention use word embeddings field natural language processing become popular topic due ability cope semantic sensitivity hence study propose novel way semi-supervised ontology population word embeddings basis build several model include traditional benchmark model new type model base word embeddings finally ensemble together come synergistic model good accuracy demonstrate ensemble model outperform individual model
