 confidence model neural semantic parsing work focus confidence modeling neural semantic parser build upon sequence-to-sequence model outline three major cause uncertainty design various metric quantify factor metric use estimate confidence score indicate whether model prediction likely correct beyond confidence estimation identify part input contribute uncertain prediction allow user interpret model verify refine input experimental result show confidence model significantly outperform widely use method rely posterior probability improve quality interpretation compare simply rely attention score
