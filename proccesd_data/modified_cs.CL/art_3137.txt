 use context event neural network model event temporal status identification focus task identify event temporal status find event directly indirectly govern target event dependency tree important context therefore extract dependency chain contain context event use input neural network model consistently outperform previous model use local context word input visualization verifies dependency chain representation effectively capture context event closely relate target event play key role predict event temporal status
