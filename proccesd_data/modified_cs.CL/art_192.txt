 part-of-speech tag two sequential transducer present method construct use cascade consisting left- right-sequential finite-state transducer fst part-of-speech po disambiguation compare hmm fst cascade advantage significantly high process speed cost slightly low accuracy application information retrieval speed important accuracy could benefit approach process tag first assign every word unique ambiguity class c look lexicon encode sequential fst every c denote single symbol e.g adj noun although represent set alternative tag give word occur sequence c word one sentence input fst cascade map leave right sequence reduced ambiguity class r i. every r denote single symbol although represent set alternative tag intuitively eliminate less likely tag c thus create r i. finally map sequence r right leave sequence single po tag i. intuitively select likely every r i. probability r c use compile time run time directly occur fsts implicitly contain structure
