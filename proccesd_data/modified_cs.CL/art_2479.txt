 unfolding shrink neural machine translation ensemble ensembling well-known technique neural machine translation nmt improve system performance instead single neural net multiple neural net topology train separately decoder generates prediction average individual model ensembling often improve quality generated translation drastically however suitable production system cumbersome slow work aim reduce runtime par single system without compromise translation quality first show ensemble unfold single large neural network imitate output ensemble system show unfold already improve runtime practice since work do gpu proceed describe set technique shrink unfolded network reduce dimensionality layer japanese-english report result network size decode speed single nmt network performs level -ensemble system
