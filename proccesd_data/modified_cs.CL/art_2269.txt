 drug-drug interaction extraction biomedical text use long short term memory network simultaneous administration multiple drug synergistic antagonistic effect one drug affect activity drug synergistic effect lead improve therapeutic outcome whereas antagonistic effect life-threatening may lead increase healthcare cost may even cause death thus identification unknown drug-drug interaction ddi important concern efficient effective healthcare although multiple resource ddi exist often unable keep pace rich amount information available fast grow biomedical text exist method model ddi extraction text classification problem mainly rely handcrafted feature feature depend domain specific tool recently neural network model use latent feature show give similar good performance exist model dependent handcrafted feature paper present three model namely b-lstm ab-lstm joint ab-lstm base long short-term memory lstm network three model utilize word position embedding latent feature thus rely explicit feature engineering use bidirectional long short-term memory bi-lstm network allow implicit feature extraction whole sentence two model ab-lstm joint ab-lstm also use attentive pooling output bi-lstm layer assign weight feature experimental result semeval- ddi extraction dataset show joint ab-lstm model outperform exist method include rely handcrafted feature two propose lstm model also perform competitively state-of-the-art method
