 build neural machine translation system use synthetic parallel data recent work show synthetic parallel data automatically generate translation model effective various neural machine translation nmt issue study build nmt system use synthetic parallel data efficient alternative real parallel data also present new type synthetic parallel corpus propose pseudo parallel data distinct previous work ground truth synthetic example mix side sentence pair experiment czech-german french-german translation demonstrate efficacy propose pseudo parallel corpus show enhanced result bidirectional translation task also substantial improvement aid ground truth real parallel corpus
