 iterative recursive attention model interpretable sequence classification natural language processing greatly benefit introduction attention mechanism however standard attention model limited interpretability task involve series inference step describe iterative recursive attention model construct incremental representation input data reuse result previously compute query train model sentiment classification datasets demonstrate capacity identify combine different aspect input easily interpretable manner obtain performance close state art
