 rank-based similarity metric word embeddings word embeddings recently impose standard represent word meaning nlp semantic similarity word pair become common evaluation benchmark representation vector cosine typically use similarity metric paper report experiment rank-based metric perform comparably vector cosine similarity estimation outperform recently-introduced challenge task outlier detection thus suggest rank-based measure improve cluster quality
