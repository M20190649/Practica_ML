 native language identification use stacked generalization ensemble method use multiple classifier prove successful approach task native language identification nli achieve current state art however systematic examination ensemble method nli yet conduct additionally deep ensemble architecture classifier stack closely evaluate present set experiment use three ensemble-based model test multiple configuration algorithm include rigorous application meta-classification model nli achieve state-of-the-art result three datasets different language also present first use statistical significance test compare nli system show result significantly good previous state art make available collection test set prediction facilitate future statistical test
