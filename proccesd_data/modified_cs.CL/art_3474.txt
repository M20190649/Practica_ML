 importance recurrent model hierarchical structure recent work show recurrent neural network rnns implicitly capture exploit hierarchical information train solve common natural language process task language model linzen et al. neural machine translation shi et al. contrast ability model structure data non-recurrent neural network receive little attention despite success many nlp task gehring et al. vaswani et al. work compare two architecture -- -recurrent versus non-recurrent -- -with respect ability model hierarchical structure find recurrency indeed important purpose
