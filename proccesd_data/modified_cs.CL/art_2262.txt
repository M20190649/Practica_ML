 adversarial learning neural dialogue generation paper draw intuition turing test propose use adversarial training open-domain dialogue generation system train produce sequence indistinguishable human-generated dialogue utterance cast task reinforcement learn rl problem jointly train two system generative model produce response sequence discriminator -- -analagous human evaluator turing test -- distinguish human-generated dialogue machine-generated one output discriminator use reward generative model push system generate dialogue mostly resemble human dialogue addition adversarial training describe model adversarial em evaluation use success fool adversary dialogue evaluation metric avoid number potential pitfall experimental result several metric include adversarial evaluation demonstrate adversarially-trained system generate higher-quality response previous baseline
