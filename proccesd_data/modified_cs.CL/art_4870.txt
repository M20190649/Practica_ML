 multi-source neural machine translation data augmentation multi-source translation system translate multiple language single target language use information multiple source system achieve large gain accuracy train system necessary corpus parallel text multiple source target language however corpus rarely complete practice due difficulty provide human translation relevant language paper propose data augmentation approach fill incomplete part use multi-source neural machine translation nmt experiment result vary different language combination significant gain observe use source language similar target language
