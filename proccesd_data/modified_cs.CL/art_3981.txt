 denoising distant supervision relation extraction via instance-level adversarial training exist neural relation extraction nre model rely distant supervision suffer wrong label problem paper propose novel adversarial training mechanism instance relation extraction alleviate noise issue compare previous denoising method propose method better discriminate informative instance noisy one method also efficient flexible apply various nre architecture show experiment large-scale benchmark dataset relation extraction denoising method effectively filter noisy instance achieve significant improvement compare state-of-the-art model
