 dynamic oracle neural machine translation decode phase past several year witness rapid progress end-to-end neural machine translation nmt however exist discrepancy training inference nmt decoding may lead serious problem since model might part state space never see training address issue schedule sampling propose however certain limitation scheduled sampling propose two dynamic oracle-based method improve manage mitigate discrepancy change training process towards less guided scheme meanwhile aggregate oracle 's demonstration experimental result show propose approach improve translation quality standard nmt system
