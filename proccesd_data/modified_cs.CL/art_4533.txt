 tree-based neural sentence model neural network tree-based sentence encoders show well result many downstream task exist tree-based encoders adopt syntactic parsing tree explicit structure prior study effectiveness different tree structure replace parsing tree trivial tree i.e. binary balance tree left-branching tree right-branching tree encoders though trivial tree contain syntactic information encoders get competitive even good result ten downstream task investigate surprising result indicate explicit syntax guidance may main contributor superior performance tree-based neural sentence modeling analysis show tree model give good result crucial word close final representation additional experiment give clue design effective tree-based encoder code open-source available http github.com explorerfreda treeenc
