 cross-lingual model word embeddings empirical comparison despite interest use cross-lingual knowledge learn word embeddings various task systematic comparison possible approach lack literature perform extensive evaluation four popular approach induce cross-lingual embeddings require different form supervision four typographically different language pair evaluation setup span four different task include intrinsic evaluation mono-lingual cross-lingual similarity extrinsic evaluation downstream semantic syntactic application show model require expensive cross-lingual knowledge almost always perform good cheaply supervised model often prove competitive certain task
