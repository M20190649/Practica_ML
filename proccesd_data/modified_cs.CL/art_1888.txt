 data recombination neural semantic parsing model crisp logical regularity crucial semantic parsing make difficult neural model task-specific prior knowledge achieve good result paper introduce data recombination novel framework inject prior knowledge model training data induce high-precision synchronous context-free grammar capture important conditional independence property commonly find semantic parsing train sequence-to-sequence recurrent network rnn model novel attention-based copying mechanism datapoints sample grammar thereby teach model structural property data recombination improve accuracy rnn model three semantic parse datasets lead new state-of-the-art performance standard geoquery dataset model comparable supervision
