 create causal embeddings question answer minimal supervision common model question answer qa good answer one closely relate question relatedness often determine use general-purpose lexical model word embeddings argue good approach look answer relate question relevant way accord information need question may determine task-specific embeddings causality use case implement insight three step first generate causal embeddings cost-effectively bootstrapping cause-effect pair extract free text use small set seed pattern second train dedicated embeddings data use task-specific context i.e. context cause effect finally extend state-of-the-art reranking approach qa incorporate causal embeddings evaluate causal embed model directly casual implication task indirectly downstream causal qa task use data yahoo answer show explicitly model causality improve performance task qa task best model achieves p significantly outperform strong baseline relative
