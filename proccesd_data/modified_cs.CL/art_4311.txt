 model task effect human reading neural attention human read make sequence fixation saccade often skip word without apparent detriment understanding offer novel explanation skip reader optimize tradeoff perform language-related task fixating word possible propose neural architecture combine attention module decide whether skip word task module memorize input show model predict human skip behavior also model read time well even though skip input key prediction model different read task result different skipping behavior confirm prediction eye-tracking experiment participant answer question text able capture experimental result use model replace memorization module task module perform neural question answering
