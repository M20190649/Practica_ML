 label-dependencies aware recurrent neural network last year recurrent neural network rnns prove effective several nlp task despite great success ability model emph sequence labeling still limit lead research toward solution rnns combine model already prove effective domain crfs work propose solution far simpler effective evolution simple jordan rnn label re-injected input network convert embeddings way word compare rnn variant rnn model elman jordan rnn lstm gru two well-known task spoken language understanding slu thanks label embeddings combination hidden layer propose variant use parameter elman jordan rnns far few lstm gru effective rnns also outperform sophisticated crf model
