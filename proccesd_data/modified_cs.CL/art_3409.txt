 bayesian model unit discovery low resource language develop speech technology low-resource language become active research field last decade among others bayesian model show promising result artificial example still lack situ experiment work apply state-of-the-art bayesian model unsupervised acoustic unit discovery aud real low-resource language scenario also show bayesian model naturally integrate information resourceful language mean informative prior lead consistent discover unit finally discover acoustic unit use either -best sequence lattice perform word segmentation word segmentation result show bayesian approach clearly outperform segmental-dtw baseline corpus
