 mgnc-cnn simple approach exploit multiple word embeddings sentence classification introduce novel simple convolution neural network cnn architecture multi-group norm constraint cnn mgnc-cnn capitalize multiple set word embeddings sentence classification mgnc-cnn extract feature input embed set independently join penultimate layer network form final feature vector adopt group regularization strategy differentially penalize weight associate subcomponents generate respective embed set model much simple comparable alternative architecture require substantially less training time furthermore flexible require input word embeddings dimensionality show mgnc-cnn consistently outperform baseline model
