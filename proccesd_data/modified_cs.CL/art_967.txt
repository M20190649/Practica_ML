 sparse overcomplete word vector representation current distributed representation word show little resemblance theory lexical semantics former dense uninterpretable latter largely base familiar discrete class e.g. supersenses relation e.g. synonymy hypernymy propose method transform word vector sparse optionally binary vector resulting representation similar interpretable feature typically use nlp though discover automatically raw corpus vector highly sparse computationally easy work importantly find outperform original vector benchmark task
