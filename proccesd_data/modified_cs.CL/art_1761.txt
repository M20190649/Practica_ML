 disfluency detection use bidirectional lstm introduce new approach disfluency detection use bidirectional long-short term memory neural network blstm addition word sequence model take input pattern match feature develop reduce sensitivity vocabulary size training lead improve performance word sequence alone blstm take advantage explicit repair state addition standard reparandum state final output leverage integer linear programming incorporate constraint disfluency structure experiment switchboard corpus model achieve state-of-the-art performance standard disfluency detection task correction detection task analysis show model good detection non-repetition disfluency tend much hard detect
