 practical incremental learning framework sparse entity extraction work address challenge arise extract entity textual data include high cost data annotation model accuracy select appropriate evaluation criterion overall quality annotation present framework integrate entity set expansion ese active learning al reduce annotation cost sparse data provide online evaluation method feedback incremental interactive learning framework allow rapid annotation subsequent extraction sparse data maintain high accuracy evaluate framework three publicly available datasets show drastically reduce cost sparse entity annotation average reach f-scores respectively moreover method exhibit robust performance across datasets
