 multi-head decoder end-to-end speech recognition paper present new network architecture call multi-head decoder end-to-end speech recognition extension multi-head attention model multi-head attention model multiple attention calculate integrate single attention hand instead integration attention level propose method use multiple decoder attention integrate output generate final output furthermore order make head capture different modality different attention function use head lead improvement recognition performance ensemble effect evaluate effectiveness propose method conduct experimental evaluation use corpus spontaneous japanese experimental result demonstrate propose method outperform conventional method location-based multi-head attention model capture different speech linguistic context within attention-based encoder-decoder framework
