 scale event extraction learn via automatic training data generation task event extraction long investigate supervised learning paradigm bind number quality training instance exist training data must manually generate combination expert domain knowledge extensive human involvement however due drastic effort require annotate text resultant datasets usually small severally affect quality learned model make hard generalize work develop automatic approach generate training data event extraction approach allow u scale event extraction training instance thousand hundred thousand much low cost manual approach achieve employ distant supervision automatically create event annotation unlabelled text use exist structure knowledge base tables.we develop neural network model post inference transfer knowledge extract structure knowledge base automatically annotate typed event correspond argument text.we evaluate approach use knowledge extract freebase label text wikipedia article experimental result show approach generate large number high quality training instance show large volume train data lead good event extractor also allow u detect multiple typed event
