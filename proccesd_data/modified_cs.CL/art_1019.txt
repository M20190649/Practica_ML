 influence chunk dependency crossing distance paper hypothesize chunk play important role reduce dependency distance dependency crossing computer simulation compare natural language show chunk reduces mean dependency distance mdd linear sequence node constrain continuity projectivity natural language interestingly chunk alone bring less dependency crossing well though fail reduce rarity find human language result suggest chunking may play vital role minimization dependency distance somewhat contributing role rarity dependency crossing addition result point possibility rarity dependency crossing mere side-effect minimization dependency distance linguistic phenomenon motivation
