 build morphological chain agglutinative language paper build morphological chain agglutinative language use log-linear model morphological segmentation task model base unsupervised morphological segmentation system call morphochains extend morphochains log linear model expand candidate space recursively cover split point agglutinative language turkish whereas original model candidate generate consider binary segmentation word result show improve state-of-art turkish score f-measure improve english score f-measure eventually system outperform morphochains well-known unsupervised morphological segmentation system result indicate candidate generation play important role unsupervised log-linear model learn use contrastive estimation negative sample
