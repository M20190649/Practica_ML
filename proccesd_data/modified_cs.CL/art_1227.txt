 chinese event extraction use deepneural network word embed lot prior work event extraction exploit variety feature represent event method several drawback feature often specific particular domain generalize well feature derive various linguistic analysis error-prone feature may expensive require domain expert paper develop chinese event extraction system use word embed vector represent language deep neural network learn abstract feature representation order greatly reduce effort feature engineering addition framework leverage large amount unlabeled data address problem limited label corpus task experiment show propose method perform well compare system use rich language feature use unlabeled data benefit word embeddings study suggest potential dnn word embedding event extraction task
