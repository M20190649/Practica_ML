 pair vec compositional word-pair embeddings cross-sentence inference reason imply relationship e.g. paraphrastic common sense encyclopedic pair word crucial many cross-sentence inference problem paper propose new method learning use embeddings word pair implicitly represent background knowledge relationship pairwise embeddings compute compositional function word representation learn maximize pointwise mutual information pmi context two word co-occur add representation cross-sentence attention layer exist inference model e.g bidaf qa esim nli instead extend replace exist word embeddings experiment show gain recently release squad multinli representation also aid good generalization gain around adversarial squad datasets adversarial entailment test set glockner et al
