 semantic parsing syntactic assurance target sentence use lstm encoder cfg-decoder semantic parsing define process map natural language sentence machine interpretable formal representation meaning semantic parse use lstm encoder-decoder neural network become promising approach however human automate translation natural language provide grammaticality guarantee sentence generate guarantee particularly important practical case data base query cause critical error sentence ungrammatical work propose neural architecture call encoder cfg-decoder whose output conforms give context-free grammar result show implementation architecture display correctness provide benchmark accuracy level well literature
