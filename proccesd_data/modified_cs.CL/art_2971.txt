 use k -way co-occurrence learn word embeddings co-occurrence two word provide useful insight semantics word consequently numerous prior work word embed learn use co-occurrence two word training signal learn word embeddings however natural language text common multiple word relate co-occurring context extend notion co-occurrence cover k geq -way co-occurrence among set k -words specifically prove theoretical relationship joint probability k geq word sum ell norm embeddings next propose learning objective motivate theoretical result utilise k -way co-occurrence learn word embeddings experimental result show derived theoretical relationship indeed hold empirically despite data sparsity small k value k -way embeddings perform comparably good -way embeddings range task
