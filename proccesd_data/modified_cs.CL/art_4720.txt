 neural network quantifier conservativity data distribution affect learnability know natural language determiner conservative psycholinguistic experiment indicate child exhibit corresponding learnability bias face task learn new determiner however recent work indicate bias towards conservativity observe training stage artificial neural network work investigate whether learnability bias exhibit child part due distribution quantifier natural language share result five experiment contrast distribution conservative vs. non-conservative determiner training data demonstrate aquisitional issue non-conservative quantifier explain distribution natural language data favor conservative quantifier finding indicate bias language acquisition data might innate representational
