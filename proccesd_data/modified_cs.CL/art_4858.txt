 robust neural abstractive summarization system evaluation adversarial information sequence-to-sequence seq seq neural model actively investigate abstractive summarization nevertheless exist neural abstractive system frequently generate factually incorrect summary vulnerable adversarial information suggest crucial lack semantic understanding paper propose novel semantic-aware neural abstractive summarization model learn generate high quality summary semantic interpretation salient content novel evaluation scheme adversarial sample introduce measure well model identify off-topic information model yield significantly good performance popular pointer-generator summarizer human evaluation also confirm system summary uniformly informative faithful well less redundant seq seq model
