 break stick ambiguity adaptive skip-gram recently propose skip-gram model powerful method learn high-dimensional word representation capture rich semantic relationship word however skip-gram well prior work learn word representation take account word ambiguity maintain single representation per word although number skip-gram modification propose overcome limitation learn multi-prototype word representation either require known number word meaning learn use greedy heuristic approach paper propose adaptive skip-gram model nonparametric bayesian extension skip-gram capable automatically learn required number representation word desire semantic resolution derive efficient online variational learning algorithm model empirically demonstrate efficiency word-sense induction task
