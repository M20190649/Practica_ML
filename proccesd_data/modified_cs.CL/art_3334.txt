 evaluate layer representation neural machine translation part-of-speech semantic tagging task neural machine translation nmt model provide improve translation quality elegant end-to-end framework less clear learn language recent work start evaluate quality vector representation learn nmt model morphological syntactic task paper investigate representation learn different layer nmt encoders train nmt system parallel data use trained model extract feature train classifier two task part-of-speech semantic tagging measure performance classifier proxy quality original nmt model give task quantitative analysis yield interest insight regard representation learning nmt model instance find high layer well learn semantics low layer tend good part-of-speech tagging also observe little effect target language source-side representation especially high quality nmt model
