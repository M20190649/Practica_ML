 syllable-based technique word embeddings korean word word embedding become fundamental component many nlp task name entity recognition machine translation however popular model learn embeddings unaware morphology word directly applicable highly agglutinative language korean propose syllable-based learning model korean use convolutional neural network word representation compose trained syllable vector model successfully produce morphologically meaningful representation korean word compare original skip-gram embeddings result also show quite robust out-of-vocabulary problem
