 mixture model learn multi-sense word embeddings word embeddings standard technique induce meaning representation word get good representation important take account different sens word paper propose mixture model learn multi-sense word embeddings model generalize previous work allow induce different weight different sens word experimental result show model outperform previous model standard evaluation task
