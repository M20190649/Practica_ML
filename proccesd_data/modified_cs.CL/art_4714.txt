 skeleton-to-response dialogue generation guide retrieval memory dialogue response generation traditional generative model generate response solely input query model rely insufficient information generate specific response since certain query could answer multiple way consequentially model tend output generic dull response impede generation informative utterance recently researcher attempt fill information gap exploit information retrieval technique generate response current query similar dialogue retrieve entire training data consider additional knowledge source may harvest massive information generative model could overwhelm lead undesirable performance paper propose new framework exploit retrieval result via skeleton-then-response paradigm first skeleton generate revise retrieved response novel generative model use generate skeleton original query response generation experimental result show approach significantly improve diversity informativeness generated response
