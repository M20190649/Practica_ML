 convolutional neural network word embeddings chinese word segmentation character-based sequence labeling framework flexible efficient chinese word segmentation cws recently many character-based neural model apply cws obtain good performance two obvious weakness first heavily rely manually design bigram feature i.e good capture n-gram feature automatically second make use full word information first weakness propose convolutional neural model able capture rich n-gram feature without feature engineering second one propose effective approach integrate propose model word embeddings evaluate model two benchmark datasets pku msr without feature engineering model obtain competitive performance -- pku msr arm word embeddings model achieve state-of-the-art performance datasets -- pku msr without use external label resource
