 semantic structure interpretability word embeddings dense word embeddings encode semantic meaning word low dimensional vector space become popular natural language processing nlp research due state-of-the-art performance many nlp task word embeddings substantially successful capture semantic relation among word meaningful semantic structure must present respective vector space however many case semantic structure broadly heterogeneously distribute across embedding dimension make interpretation big challenge study propose statistical method uncover latent semantic structure dense word embeddings perform analysis introduce new dataset semcat contain word semantically group category propose method quantify interpretability word embeddings propose method practical alternative classical word intrusion test require human intervention
