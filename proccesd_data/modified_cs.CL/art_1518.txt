 deep stacking network low-resource chinese word segmentation transfer learning recent year neural network prove effective chinese word segmentation however promising performance relies large-scale training data neural network conventional architecture achieve desired result low-resource datasets due lack labelled training data paper propose deep stacking framework improve performance word segmentation task insufficient data integrate datasets diverse domain framework consist two part domain-based model deep stacking network domain-based model use learn knowledge different datasets deep stacking network design integrate domain-based model reduce model conflict innovatively add communication path among model design various structure deep stacking network include gaussian-based stacking network concatenate-based stacking network sequence-based stacking network tree-based stacking network conduct experiment six low-resource datasets various domain propose framework show significant performance improvement datasets compare several strong baseline
