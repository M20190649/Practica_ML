 knowledge-aware conversational semantic parsing web table conversational semantic parsing table require knowledge acquire reason ability well explore current state-of-the-art approach motivate fact propose knowledge-aware semantic parser improve parse performance integrate various type knowledge paper consider three type knowledge include grammar knowledge expert knowledge external resource knowledge first grammar knowledge empower model effectively replicate previously generate logical form effectively handle co-reference ellipsis phenomenon conversation second base expert knowledge propose decomposable model controllable compare traditional end-to-end model put burden learn trial-and-error end-to-end way third external resource knowledge i.e. provide pre-trained language model entity type model use improve representation question table good semantic understanding conduct experiment sequentialqa dataset result show knowledge-aware model outperform state-of-the-art approach incremental experimental result also prove usefulness various knowledge analysis show approach ability derive meaning representation context-dependent utterance leverage previously generate outcome
