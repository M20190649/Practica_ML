 gmm-free flat start sequence-discriminative dnn training recently attempt make remove gaussian mixture model gmm training process deep neural network-based hidden markov model hmm dnn gmm-free training hmm dnn hybrid solve two problem namely initial alignment frame-level state label creation context-dependent state although flat-start training via iteratively realign retrain dnn use frame-level error function viable quite cumbersome propose use sequence-discriminative training criterion flat start sequence-discriminative training routinely apply final phase model training show proper caution also suitable get alignment context-independent dnn model construction tied state apply recently propose kl-divergence-based state clustering method hence whole training process gmm-free experimental evaluation find sequence-discriminative flat start training method significantly faster straightforward approach iterative retraining realignment word error rate attain slightly well well
