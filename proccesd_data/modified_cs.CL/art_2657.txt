 biomedical event trigger identification use bidirectional recurrent neural network base model biomedical event describe complex interaction various biomedical entity event trigger word phrase typically signify occurrence event event trigger identification important first step event extraction method however many current approach either rely complex hand-crafted feature consider feature within window paper propose method take advantage recurrent neural network rnn extract high level feature present across sentence thus hidden state representation rnn along word entity type embed feature avoid rely complex hand-crafted feature generate use various nlp toolkits experiment show achieve state-of-art f -score multi level event extraction mlee corpus also perform category-wise analysis result discuss importance various feature trigger identification task
