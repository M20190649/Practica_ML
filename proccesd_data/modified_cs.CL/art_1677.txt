 improve transition-based parsing model character instead word lstms present extension continuous-state dependency parse method make applicable morphologically rich language start high-performance transition-based parser use long short-term memory lstm recurrent neural network learn representation parser state replace lookup-based word representation representation construct orthographic representation word also use lstms allow statistical share across word form similar surface experiment morphologically rich languages show parse model benefit incorporate character-based encoding word
