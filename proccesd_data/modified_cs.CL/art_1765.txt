 speed-constrained tuning statistical machine translation use bayesian optimization address problem automatically find parameter statistical machine translation system maximize bleu score ensure decode speed exceed minimum value propose use bayesian optimization efficiently tune speed-related decoding parameter easily incorporate speed noisy constraint function obtained parameter value guarantee satisfy speed constraint associated confidence margin across three language pair two speed constraint value report overall optimization time reduction compare grid random search also show bayesian optimization decouple speed bleu measurement result reduction overall optimization time speed measure small subset sentence
