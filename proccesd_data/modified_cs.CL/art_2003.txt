 left-corner method syntactic modeling universal structural constraint primary goal thesis identify well syntactic constraint bias language independent also efficiently exploitable sentence processing focus particular syntactic construction call center-embedding well study psycholinguistics note cause particular difficulty comprehension since people use language tool communication one expect complex construction avoid communication efficiency computational perspective center-embedding closely relevant left-corner parsing algorithm capture degree center-embedding parse tree construct connection suggest left-corner method tool exploit universal syntactic constraint people avoid generate center-embedded structure explore utility center-embedding well left-corner method extensively several theoretical empirical examination primary task unsupervised grammar induction task input algorithm collection sentence model try extract salient pattern grammar particularly hard problem although expect universal constraint may help improve performance since effectively restrict possible search space model build model extend left-corner parsing algorithm efficiently tabulate search space except involve center-embedding specific degree examine effectiveness approach many treebanks demonstrate often constraint lead well parse performance thus conclude left-corner method particularly useful syntax-oriented system exploit efficiently inherent universal constraint language
