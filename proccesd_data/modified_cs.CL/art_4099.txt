 recurrent one-hop prediction reason knowledge graph large scale knowledge graph kg freebase generally incomplete reason multi-hop mh kg path thus important capability need question answering nlp task require knowledge world mh-kg reason include diverse scenario e.g. give head entity relation path predict tail entity give two entity connect relation path predict unknown relation present rops recurrent one-hop predictor predict entity step mh-kb path use recurrent neural network vector representation entity relation two benefit model mh-paths arbitrary length update entity relation representation training signal step ii handle different type mh-kg reasoning unified framework model show state-of-the-art two important multi-hop kg reason task knowledge base completion path query answering
