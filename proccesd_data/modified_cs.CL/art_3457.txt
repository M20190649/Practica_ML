 hybrid model word prediction use naive bayes latent information historically natural language processing area give much attention many researcher one main motivation beyond interest relate word prediction problem state give set word sentence one recommend next word literature problem solve method base syntactic semantic analysis solely analysis achieve practical result end-user application instance latent semantic analysis handle semantic feature text suggest word consider syntactical rule hand model treat method together achieve state-of-the-art result e.g deep learning model demand high computational effort make model infeasible certain type application advance technology mathematical model possible develop faster system accuracy work propose hybrid word suggestion model base naive bayes latent semantic analysis consider neighbouring word around unfilled gap result show model could achieve accuracy msr sentence completion challenge
