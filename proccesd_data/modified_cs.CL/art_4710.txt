 unsupervised abstractive sentence summarization use length control variational autoencoder work present unsupervised approach summarize sentence abstractive way use variational autoencoder vae vae know learn semantically rich latent variable represent high dimensional input vaes train learn reconstruct input probabilistic latent variable explicitly provide information output length training influence vae encode information thus manipulate inference instruct decoder produce short output sequence lead express input sentence few word show different summarization data set short sentence beat simple baseline yield high rouge score try reconstruct whole sentence
