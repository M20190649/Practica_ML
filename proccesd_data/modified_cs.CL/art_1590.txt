 fast btg-forest-based hierarchical sub-sentential alignment paper propose novel btg-forest-based alignment method base fast unsupervised initialization parameter use variational ibm model synchronously parse parallel sentence top-down align hierarchically constraint btg two-step method achieve run-time comparable translation performance fast align yield small phrase table final smt result show method even outperform experiment distantly relate language e.g. english-japanese
