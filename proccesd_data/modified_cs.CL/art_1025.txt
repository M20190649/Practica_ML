 unsupervised spoken term detection spoken query multi-level acoustic pattern vary model granularity paper present new approach unsupervised spoken term detection spoken query use multiple set acoustic pattern automatically discover target corpus different pattern hmm configuration number state per model number distinct model number gaussians per state form three-dimensional model granularity space different set acoustic pattern automatically discover different point properly distribute three-dimensional space complementary one another thus jointly capture characteristic spoken term represent spoken content spoken query sequence acoustic pattern series approach match pattern index sequence consider signal variation develop way on-line computation load reduce signal distribution cause different speaker acoustic condition reasonably take care result indicate approach significantly outperform unsupervised feature-based dtw baseline mean average precision timit corpus
