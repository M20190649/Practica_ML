 diversity-promoting objective function neural conversation model sequence-to-sequence neural network model generation conversational response tend generate safe commonplace response e.g. n't know regardless input suggest traditional objective function i.e. likelihood output response give input message unsuited response generation task instead propose use maximum mutual information mmi objective function neural model experimental result demonstrate propose mmi model produce diverse interesting appropriate response yield substantive gain bleu score two conversational datasets human evaluation
