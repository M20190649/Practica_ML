 multi-label transfer learn multi-relational semantic similarity multi-relational semantic similarity datasets define semantic relation two short text multiple way e.g. similarity relatedness yet system date design capture relation target one relation time propose multi-label transfer learn approach base lstm make prediction several relation simultaneously aggregate loss update parameter multi-label regression approach jointly learn information provide multiple relation rather treat separate task approach outperform single-task approach traditional multi-task learning approach also achieve state-of-the-art performance one relation human activity phrase dataset
