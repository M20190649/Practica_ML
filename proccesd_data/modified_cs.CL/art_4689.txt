 evaluate semantic rationality sentence sememe-word-matching neural network base hownet automatic evaluation semantic rationality important yet challenge task current automatic technique well identify whether sentence semantically rational method base language model measure sentence rationality commonness method base similarity human write sentence fail human-written reference available paper propose novel model call sememe-word-matching neural network swm-nn tackle semantic rationality evaluation take advantage sememe knowledge base hownet advantage model utilize proper combination sememes represent fine-grained semantic meaning word within specific context use fine-grained semantic representation help model learn semantic dependency among word evaluate effectiveness propose model build large-scale rationality evaluation dataset experimental result dataset show propose model outperform competitive baseline improvement accuracy
