 compositional learning relation path embed knowledge base completion large-scale knowledge base currently reach impressive size however knowledge base still far complete addition exist method knowledge base completion consider direct link entity ignore vital impact consistent semantics relation path paper study problem better embed entity relation knowledge base different low-dimensional space take full advantage additional semantics relation path propose compositional learning model relation path embed rpe specifically corresponding relation path projection rpe simultaneously embed entity two type latent space also propose type constraint could extend traditional relation-specific constraint new propose path-specific constraint result experiment show propose model achieve significant consistent improvement compare state-of-the-art algorithm
