 event coreference resolution use neural network classifier paper present neural network classifier approach detect within- cross- document event coreference effectively use event mention base feature approach yet rely event argument feature semantic role spatiotemporal argument experimental result ecb dataset show approach produce f score significantly outperform state-of-the-art method within-document cross-document event coreference resolution use b ceafe evaluation measure get bad f score muc measure however use conll measure average three score approach slightly good f within- document event coreference resolution significantly good cross-document event coreference resolution
