 tiered clustering improve lexical entailment many task natural language processing involve recognize lexical entailment two different approach problem propose recently quite different first asymmetric similarity measure design give high score context narrow term entailment subset broad term second supervised approach classifier learn predict entailment give concatenated latent vector representation word approach vector space model use single context vector representation word work study effect cluster word sens use multiple context vector infer entailment use extension two algorithm find approach offer improvement entailment algorithm
