 sentence model via multiple word embeddings multi-level comparison semantic textual similarity different word embed model capture different aspect linguistic property inspire u propose model m-maxlstm-cnn employ multiple set word embeddings evaluate sentence similarity relation represent word multiple word embeddings maxlstm-cnn encoder generate novel sentence embedding learn similarity relation sentence embeddings via multi-level comparison method m-maxlstm-cnn consistently show strong performance several task i.e. measure textual similarity identify paraphrase recognize textual entailment accord experimental result sts benchmark dataset sick dataset semeval m-maxlstm-cnn outperforms state-of-the-art method textual similarity task model use hand-crafted feature e.g. alignment feature ngram overlap dependency feature well require pre-trained word embeddings dimension
