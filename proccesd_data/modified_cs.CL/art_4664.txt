 deep reinforced sequence-to-set model multi-label text classification multi-label text classification mltc aim assign multiple label sample dataset label usually internal correlation however traditional method tend ignore correlation label order capture correlation label sequence-to-sequence seq seq model view mltc task sequence generation problem achieve excellent performance task however seq seq model suitable mltc task essence reason require human predefine order output label output label mltc task essentially unordered set rather ordered sequence conflict strict requirement seq seq model label order paper propose novel sequence-to-set framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning capture correlation label also reduce dependence label order extensive experimental result show propose method outperform competitive baseline large margin
