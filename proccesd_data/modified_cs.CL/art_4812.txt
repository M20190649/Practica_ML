 semi-supervised method out-of-domain dependency parse dependency parsing one important natural language processing task assign syntactic tree texts due wider availability dependency corpus improve parsing machine learning technique parse accuracy supervised learning-based system significantly improve however due nature supervised learning parse system highly rely manually annotated training corpus work reasonably good in-domain data performance drop significantly test out-of-domain text bridge performance gap in-domain out-of-domain thesis investigate three semi-supervised technique out-of-domain dependency parsing namely co-training self-training dependency language model approach use easily obtainable unlabelled data improve out-of-domain parse accuracy without need expensive corpus annotation evaluation several english domain multi-lingual data show quite good improvement parse accuracy overall work conduct survey semi-supervised method out-of-domain dependency parsing extend compare number important semi-supervised method unified framework comparison technique show self-training work equally well co-training out-of-domain parsing dependency language model improve in- out-of-domain accuracy
