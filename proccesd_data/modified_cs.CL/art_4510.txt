 tree-based decoder neural machine translation recent advance neural machine translation nmt show add syntactic information nmt system improve quality translation existing work utilizes specific type linguistically-inspired tree structure like constituency dependency parse tree often do via standard rnn decoder operate linearized target tree structure however open question specific linguistic formalism best structural representation nmt paper propose nmt model naturally generate topology arbitrary tree structure target side experiment various target tree structure experiment show surprising result model deliver best improvement balanced binary tree construct without linguistic knowledge model outperform standard seq seq model bleu point method incorporate target-side syntax bleu
