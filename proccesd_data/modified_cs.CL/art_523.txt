 post-editing error correction algorithm speech recognition use bing spell suggestion asr short automatic speech recognition process convert spoken speech text manipulate computer although asr several application still erroneous imprecise especially use harsh surround wherein input speech low quality paper propose post-editing asr error correction method algorithm base bing 's online spell suggestion approach asr recognize output text spell-checked use bing 's spell suggestion technology detect correct misrecognized word specifically propose algorithm break asr output text several word-tokens submit search query bing search engine returned spell suggestion implies query misspell thus replace suggested correction otherwise correction perform algorithm continue next token token get validate experiment carry various speech different language indicate successful decrease number asr error improvement overall error correction rate future research improve upon propose algorithm much parallelize take advantage multiprocessor computer
