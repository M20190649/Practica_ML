 latent tree learn model identify meaningful structure sentence recent work problem latent tree learning make possible train neural network learn parse sentence use result parse interpret sentence without exposure ground-truth parse tree training time surprisingly model often perform good sentence understand task model use parse tree conventional parser paper aim investigate latent tree learn model learn replicate two model shared codebase find one model outperform conventional tree-structured model sentence classification ii parsing strategy especially consistent across random restarts iii par produce tend shallow standard penn treebank ptb par iv resemble ptb semantic syntactic formalism author aware
