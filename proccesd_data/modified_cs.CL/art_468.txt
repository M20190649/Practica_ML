 cross-moments computation stochastic context-free grammar paper consider problem efficient computation cross-moments vector random variable represent stochastic context-free grammar two type cross-moments discuss sample space first one set derivation context-free grammar sample space second one set derivation generate string belonging language grammar past problem widely study mainly cross-moments scalar variable second order paper present new algorithm compute cross-moments arbitrary order previously develop one derive special case
