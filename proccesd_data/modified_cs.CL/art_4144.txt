 recurrent dnns ensemble timit phone recognition task paper investigate recurrent deep neural network dnns combination regularization technique dropout zoneout regularization post-layer benchmark choose timit phone recognition task due popularity broad availability community also simulate low-resource scenario helpful minor language also prefer phone recognition task much sensitive acoustic model quality large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task recent year recurrent dnns push error rate automatic speech recognition clear winner proposed architecture dropout use regularization technique case combination regularization technique together model ensemble omit however ensemble recurrent dnns perform best achieve average phone error rate experiment minimum core test set slightly low best-published per date accord knowledge finally contrast paper publish open-source script easily replicate result help continue development
