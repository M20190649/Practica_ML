 deep learning embeddings discontinuous linguistic unit deep learn embeddings successfully use many natural language processing problem embeddings mostly compute word form although number recent paper extend linguistic unit like morpheme phrase paper argue learn embeddings discontinuous linguistic unit also consider experimental evaluation coreference resolution show embeddings perform good word form embeddings
