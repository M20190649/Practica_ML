 simple approach learn polysemous word embeddings many nlp application require disambiguate polysemous word exist method learn polysemous word vector representation involve first detect various sens optimize sense-specific embeddings separately invariably involved single sense learn method word vec evaluate method also problematic rigorous quantitative evaluation space limit especially compare single-sense embeddings paper propose simple method learn word representation give context method require learn usual single sense representation coefficient learnt via single pas data propose several new test set evaluate word sense induction relevance detection contextual word similarity significantly supplement currently available test result test show method embarrassingly simple achieve excellent result compare state art model unsupervised polysemous word representation learning
