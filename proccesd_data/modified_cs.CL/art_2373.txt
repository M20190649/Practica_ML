 scaffold network incremental learning teach question introduce new paradigm learn reason understanding prediction well scaffolding network implement paradigm scaffolding network embody incremental learning approach formulate teacher-student network architecture teach machine understand text reasoning key computational scaffolding approach interaction teacher student sequential questioning student observe sentence text incrementally use attention-based neural net discover register key information relation current memory meanwhile teacher ask question observed text student network get reward correctly answer question entire network update continually use reinforcement learning experimental result synthetic real datasets show scaffold network outperform state-of-the-art method also learn reason scalable way even little human generate input
