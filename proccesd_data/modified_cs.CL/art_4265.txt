 unsupervised online multitask learning behavioral sentence embeddings unsupervised learning attractive method easily derive meaningful data representation vast amount unlabeled data representation embeddings often yield superior result many task whether use directly feature subsequent training stage however quality embeddings highly dependent assumed knowledge unlabeled data system extract information without supervision domain portability also limited unsupervised learning often require re-training in-domain corpus achieve robustness work present multitask paradigm unsupervised contextual learning behavioral interaction address unsupervised domain adaption introduce online multitask objective unsupervised learning show sentence embeddings generate process increase performance affective task
