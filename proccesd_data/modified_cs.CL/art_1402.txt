 semantic refinement gru-based neural language generation spoken dialogue system natural language generation nlg play critical role spoken dialogue system paper present new approach nlg use recurrent neural network rnn gating mechanism apply rnn computation allow propose model generate appropriate sentence rnn-based generator learn unaligned data jointly train sentence planning surface realization produce natural language response model extensively evaluate four different nlg domain result show propose generator achieve good performance nlg domains compare previous generator
