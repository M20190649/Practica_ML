 neural skill transfer supervised language task read comprehension read comprehension challenge task natural language processing require set skill solve current approach focus solve task whole paper propose use neural network skill transfer approach transfer knowledge several lower-level language task skills include textual entailment name entity recognition paraphrase detection question type classification reading comprehension model conduct empirical evaluation show transfer language skill knowledge lead significant improvement task much few step compare baseline model also show skill transfer approach effective even small amount training data another finding work use token-wise deep label supervision text classification improve performance transfer learning
