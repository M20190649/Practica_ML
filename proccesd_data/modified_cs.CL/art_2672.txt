 character composition model convolutional neural network dependency parse morphologically rich languages present transition-based dependency parser use convolutional neural network compose word representation character character composition model show great improvement word-lookup model especially parse agglutinative language improvement even good use pre-trained word embeddings extra data spmrl data set system outperform previous best greedy parser ballesteros et al. margin average
