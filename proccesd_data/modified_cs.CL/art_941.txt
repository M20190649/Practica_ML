 ccg parsing multiword expression thesis present study integration information multiword expression mwes parse combinatory categorial grammar ccg build previous work show benefit add information mwes syntactic parsing implement similar pipeline ccg parsing specifically collapse mwes one token training test data ccgbank corpus contain sentence annotate ccg derivation collapse algorithm however deal mwes form constituent data one limitation approach study effect collapse training test data parsing effect obtain collapse data help parser decision training effect obtain training collapsed data improves result also collapse gold standard show model significantly outperform baseline model gold standard indicate training effect show baseline model performs significantly well gold standard data collapse parse data collapse parse indicate parsing effect show result lead improved performance non-collapsed standard benchmark although fail show significantly conclude despite limited setting noticeable improvement use mwes parsing discuss way incorporation mwes parse improve hypothesize lead substantial result finally show turn mwe recognition part pipeline experimental part useful thing obtain different result different recognizers
