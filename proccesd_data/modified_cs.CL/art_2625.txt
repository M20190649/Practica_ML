 evaluate vector-space model analogy vector-space representation provide geometric tool reason similarity set object relationship recent machine learn method derive vector-space embeddings word e.g. word vec achieve considerable success natural language processing vector space also show exhibit surprising capacity capture verbal analogy similar result natural image give new life classic model analogy parallelogram first propose cognitive scientist evaluate parallelogram model analogy apply modern word embeddings provide detailed analysis extent approach capture human relational similarity judgment large benchmark dataset find semantic relationship well capture others provide evidence deep limitation parallelogram model base intrinsic geometric constraint vector space parallel classic result first-order similarity
