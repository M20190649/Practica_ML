 mem seq effectively incorporate knowledge base end-to-end task-oriented dialog system end-to-end task-oriented dialog system usually suffer challenge incorporate knowledge base paper propose novel yet simple end-to-end differentiable model call memory-to-sequence mem seq address issue mem seq first neural generative model combine multi-hop attention memory idea pointer network empirically show mem seq control generation step multi-hop attention mechanism help learn correlation memory addition model quite general without complicate task-specific design result show mem seq train faster attain state-of-the-art performance three different task-oriented dialog datasets
