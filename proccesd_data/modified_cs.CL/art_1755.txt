 transfer learn low-resource neural machine translation encoder-decoder framework neural machine translation nmt show effective large data scenario much less effective low-resource language present transfer learn method significantly improve bleu score across range low-resource language key idea first train high-resource language pair parent model transfer learned parameter low-resource pair child model initialize constrain training use transfer learn method improve baseline nmt model average bleu four low-resource language pair ensembling unknown word replacement add another bleu bring nmt performance low-resource machine translation close strong syntax base machine translation sbmt system exceed performance one language pair additionally use transfer learn model re-scoring improve sbmt system average bleu improve state-of-the-art low-resource machine translation
