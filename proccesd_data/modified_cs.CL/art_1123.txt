 agreement-based joint training bidirectional attention-based neural machine translation attentional mechanism prove effective improve end-to-end neural machine translation however due intricate structural divergence natural language unidirectional attention-based model might capture partial aspect attentional regularity propose agreement-based joint training bidirectional attention-based end-to-end neural machine translation instead train source-to-target target-to-source translation model independently approach encourage two complementary model agree word alignment matrix training data experiment chinese-english english-french translation task show agreement-based joint training significantly improve alignment translation quality independent training
