 use large target vocabulary neural machine translation neural machine translation recently propose approach machine translation base purely neural network show promising result compare exist approach phrase-based statistical machine translation despite recent success neural machine translation limitation handle large vocabulary training complexity well decode complexity increase proportionally number target word paper propose method allow u use large target vocabulary without increase training complexity base importance sampling show decode efficiently do even model large target vocabulary select small subset whole target vocabulary model train propose approach empirically find outperform baseline model small vocabulary well lstm-based neural machine translation model furthermore use ensemble model large target vocabulary achieve state-of-the-art translation performance measure bleu english- german translation almost high performance state-of-the-art english- french translation system
