 learn document embeddings predict n-grams sentiment classification long movie review despite loss semantic information bag-of-ngram base method still achieve state-of-the-art result task sentiment classification long movie review many document embeddings method propose capture semantics still ca n't outperform bag-of-ngram base method task paper modify architecture recently propose paragraph vector allow learn document vector predict word n-gram feature well model able capture semantics word order document keep expressive power learned vector experimental result imdb movie review dataset show model outperform previous deep learning model bag-of-ngram base model due advantage robust result also obtain model combine model source code model also publish together paper
