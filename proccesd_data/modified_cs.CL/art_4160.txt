 bfgan backward forward generative adversarial network lexically constrain sentence generation incorporate prior knowledge like lexical constraint model 's output generate meaningful coherent sentence many application dialogue system machine translation image captioning etc however exist rnn-based model incrementally generate sentence leave right via beam search make difficult directly introduce lexical constraint generated sentence paper propose new algorithmic framework dub bfgan address challenge specifically employ backward generator forward generator generate lexically constrained sentence together use discriminator guide joint training two generator assign reward signal due difficulty bfgan training propose several train technique make training process stable efficient extensive experiment two large-scale datasets human evaluation demonstrate bfgan significant improvement previous method
