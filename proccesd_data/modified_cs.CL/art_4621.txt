 policy shaping generalized update equation semantic parsing denotation semantic parse denotation face two key challenge model training give denotation e.g. answer search good candidate semantic par choose best model update algorithm propose effective general solution use policy shaping bias search procedure towards semantic par compatible text provide good supervision signal training addition propose update equation generalize three different family learn algorithm enable fast model exploration experiment recently propose sequential question answer dataset framework lead new state-of-the-art model outperform previous work absolute exact match accuracy
