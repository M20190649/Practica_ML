 in-depth question classification use convolutional neural network convolutional neural network computer vision fairly intuitive typical cnn use image classification first layer learn edge following layer learn filter identify object cnns natural language processing use often completely intuitive good idea convolution filter learn task text classification propose neural network structure able give good result less time use convolutional neural network predict primary broad topic question use separate network predict topic accurately classify sub-topics
