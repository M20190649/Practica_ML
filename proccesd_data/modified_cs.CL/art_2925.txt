 combine discrete neural feature sequence label neural network model recently receive heat research attention natural language processing community compare traditional model discrete feature neural model two main advantage first take low-dimensional real-valued embed vector input train large raw data thereby address issue feature sparsity discrete model second deep neural network use automatically combine input feature include non-local feature capture semantic pattern express use discrete indicator feature result neural network model achieve competitive accuracy compare best discrete model range nlp task hand manual feature template carefully investigate nlp task decade typically cover useful indicator pattern solve problem information complementary feature automatically induce neural network therefore combine discrete neural feature potentially lead good accuracy compare model leverage discrete neural feature paper systematically investigate effect discrete neural feature combination range fundamental nlp task base sequence labeling include word segmentation po tagging name entity recognition chinese english respectively result standard benchmark show state-of-the-art neural model give accuracy comparable best discrete model literature task comb discrete neural feature unanimously yield good result
