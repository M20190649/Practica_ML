 contextual position-aware factorization machine sentiment classification exist machine learning model achieve great success sentiment classification typically explicitly capture sentiment-oriented word interaction lead poor result fine-grained analysis snippet level phrase sentence factorization machine provide possible approach learn element-wise interaction recommender system directly applicable task due inability model context word sequence work develop two position-aware factorization machine consider word interaction context position information information jointly encode set sentiment-oriented word interaction vector compare traditional word embeddings swi vector explicitly capture sentiment-oriented word interaction simplify parameter learning experimental result show comparable performance state-of-the-art method document-level classification benefit snippet sentence-level sentiment analysis
