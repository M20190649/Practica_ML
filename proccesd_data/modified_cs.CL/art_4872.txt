 neural morphological tagging estonian develop neural morphological tagging disambiguation model estonian first experiment two neural architecture morphological tag standard multiclass classifier treat morphological tag single unit sequence model handle morphological tag sequence morphological category value secondly complement model analysis generate rule-based estonian morphological analyser vabamorf thus perform soft morphological disambiguation compare two way supplement neural morphological tagger output firstly add combined analysis embeddings word representation input neural tagging model secondly adopt attention mechanism focus relevant analysis generate experiment three estonian datasets show neural architecture consistently outperform non-neural baseline include hmm-disambiguated vabamorf augment model output result performance boost model
