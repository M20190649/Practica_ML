 optimal multi-paragraph text segmentation dynamic programming exist several method calculate similarity curve sequence similarity value represent lexical cohesion successive text constituent e.g. paragraph method decide location fragment boundary however scarce propose fragmentation method base dynamic programming method theoretically sound guarantee provide optimal splitting basis similarity curve preferred fragment length cost function define method especially useful control fragment size importance
