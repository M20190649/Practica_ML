 incorporate word embeddings open directory project base large-scale classification recently implicit representation model embed deep learning successfully adopt text classification task due outstanding performance however approach limit small- moderate-scale text classification explicit representation model often use large-scale text classification like open directory project odp -based text classification however performance model limit associate knowledge base paper incorporate word embeddings odp-based large-scale classification end first generate category vector represent semantics odp category jointly model word embeddings odp-based text classification propose novel semantic similarity measure utilize category word vector obtain joint model word embeddings respectively evaluation result clearly show efficacy methodology large-scale text classification propose scheme exhibit significant improvement term macro-averaging f -score precision k respectively state-of-the-art technique
