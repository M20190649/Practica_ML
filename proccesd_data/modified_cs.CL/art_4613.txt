 improve generalization vocal tract feature reconstruction augment acoustic inversion articulatory feature reconstruction without articulatory data address problem reconstruct articulatory movement give audio phonetic label scarce availability multi-speaker articulatory data make difficult learn reconstruction generalize new speaker across datasets first consider xrmb dataset audio articulatory measurement phonetic transcription available show phonetic label use input deep recurrent neural network reconstruct articulatory feature general helpful acoustic feature match mismatch training-testing condition second experiment test novel approach attempt build articulatory feature prior articulatory information extract phonetic label approach recovers vocal tract movement directly acoustic-only dataset without use articulatory measurement result show articulatory feature generate approach correlate pearson product-moment correlation measured articulatory feature
