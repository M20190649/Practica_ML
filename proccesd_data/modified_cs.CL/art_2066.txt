 bi-lstm-rnn model relation classification use low-cost sequence feature relation classification associate many potential application artificial intelligence area recent approach usually leverage neural network base structure feature syntactic dependency feature solve problem however high-cost structure feature make approach inconvenient directly use addition structure feature probably domain-dependent therefore paper propose bi-directional long-short-term-memory recurrent-neural-network bi-lstm-rnn model base low-cost sequence feature address relation classification model divide sentence text segment five part namely two target entity three context learn representation entity context use classify relation evaluate model two standard benchmark datasets different domain namely semeval- task bionlp-st task bb former dataset model achieve comparable performance compare model use sequence feature latter dataset model obtain third best result compare model official evaluation moreover find context two target entity play important role relation classification furthermore statistic experiment show context two target entity use approximate replacement short dependency path dependency parsing use
