 dependency-based hybrid tree semantic parsing propose novel dependency-based hybrid tree model semantic parsing convert natural language utterance machine interpretable meaning representation unlike previous state-of-the-art model semantic information interpret latent dependency natural language word joint representation dependency information capture interaction semantics natural language word integrate neural component model propose efficient dynamic-programming algorithm perform tractable inference extensive experiment standard multilingual geoquery dataset eight language demonstrate propose approach able achieve state-of-the-art performance across several language analysis also justify effectiveness use new dependency-based representation
