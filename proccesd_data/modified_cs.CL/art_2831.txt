 use linguistic feature improve generalization capability neural coreference resolvers coreference resolution intermediate step text understanding use task domain necessarily coreference annotate corpus therefore generalization special importance coreference resolution however recent coreference resolvers notable improvement conll dataset struggle generalize properly new domain datasets paper investigate role linguistic feature build generalizable coreference resolvers show generalization improve slightly merely use set additional linguistic feature however employ feature subset value informative coreference resolution considerably improve generalization thanks good generalization system achieve state-of-the-art result out-of-domain evaluation e.g. wikicoref system train conll achieve on-par performance system design dataset
