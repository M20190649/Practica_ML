 linguistically regularize lstms sentiment classification sentiment understanding long-term goal ai past decade paper deal sentence-level sentiment classification though variety neural network model propose recently however previous model either depend expensive phrase-level annotation whose performance drop substantially train sentence-level annotation fully employ linguistic resource e.g. sentiment lexicon negation word intensity word thus able produce linguistically coherent representation paper propose simple model train sentence-level annotation also attempt generate linguistically coherent representation employ regularizers model linguistic role sentiment lexicon negation word intensity word result show model effective capture sentiment shift effect sentiment negation intensity word still obtain competitive result without sacrifice model simplicity
