 query-by-example search discriminative neural acoustic word embeddings query-by-example search often use dynamic time warp dtw compare query propose match segment recent work show compare speech segment represent fixed-dimensional vector -- acoustic word embeddings -- measure vector distance e.g. cosine distance discriminate word accurately dtw-based approach consider approach query-by-example search embed query database segment accord neural model follow nearest-neighbor search find matching segment earlier work embedding-based query-by-example use template-based acoustic word embeddings achieve competitive performance find embeddings base recurrent neural network train optimize word discrimination achieve substantial improvement performance run-time efficiency previous approach
