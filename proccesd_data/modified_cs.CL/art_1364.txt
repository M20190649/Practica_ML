 multi-view recurrent neural acoustic word embeddings recent work begin explore neural acoustic word embeddings -- -fixed-dimensional vector representation arbitrary-length speech segment correspond word embeddings applicable speech retrieval recognition task reason whole word may make possible avoid ambiguous sub-word representation main idea map acoustic sequence fixed-dimensional vector example word map similar vector different-word example map different vector work take multi-view approach learn acoustic word embeddings jointly learn embed acoustic sequence corresponding character sequence use deep bidirectional lstm embed model multi-view contrastive loss study effect different loss variant include fixed-margin cost-sensitive loss acoustic word embeddings improve previous approach task word discrimination also present result task enable multi-view approach include cross-view word discrimination word similarity
