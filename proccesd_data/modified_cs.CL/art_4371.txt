 adversarial neural network cross-lingual sequence tag study cross-lingual sequence tag little label data target language adversarial training previously show effective train cross-lingual sentence classifier however clear language-agnostic representation enforce adversarial language discriminator also enable effective transfer token-level prediction task therefore experiment different type adversarial training two task dependency parsing sentence compression show adversarial training consistently lead improve cross-lingual performance task compare conventionally trained baseline
