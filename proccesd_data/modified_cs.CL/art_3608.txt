 frustratingly easy meta-embedding -- compute meta-embeddings average source word embeddings create accurate meta-embeddings pre-trained source embeddings receive attention lately method base global locally-linear transformation concatenation show produce accurate meta-embeddings paper show arithmetic mean two distinct word embed set yield performant meta-embedding comparable good complex meta-embedding learning method result seem counter-intuitive give vector space different source embeddings comparable simply average give insight average still produce accurate meta-embedding despite incomparability source vector space
