 one-shot neural cross-lingual transfer paradigm completion present novel cross-lingual transfer method paradigm completion task map lemma inflected form use neural encoder-decoder model state art monolingual task use label data high-resource language increase performance low-resource language experiment language pair four different language family obtain high accuracy without transfer show even zero-shot one-shot learning possible find degree language relatedness strongly influence ability transfer morphological knowledge
