 zero-resource neural machine translation multi-agent communication game end-to-end neural machine translation nmt achieve notable success past year translate handful resource-rich language pair still suffer data scarcity problem low-resource language pair domain tackle problem propose interactive multimodal framework zero-resource neural machine translation instead passively expose large amount parallel corpus learner implement encoder-decoder architecture engage cooperative image description game thus develop image captioning neural machine translation model need communicate order succeed game experimental result iapr-tc multi k datasets show propose learning mechanism significantly improve state-of-the-art method
