 zero-shot transfer learning event extraction previous event extraction study rely heavily feature derive annotated event mention thus apply new event type without annotation effort work take fresh look event extraction model grounding problem design transferable neural architecture map event mention type jointly share semantic space use structural compositional neural network type event mention determine close candidate type leverage available manual annotation small set exist event type exist event ontology framework applies new event type without require additional annotation experiment exist event type e.g. ace ere new event type e.g. framenet demonstrate effectiveness approach textit without manual annotation new event type zero-shot framework achieve performance comparable state-of-the-art supervised model train annotation event mention
