 direct network transfer transfer learning sentence embeddings semantic similarity sentence encoders produce sentence embeddings use neural network typically evaluate well transfer downstream task include semantic similarity important task natural language understanding although much work dedicate build sentence encoders accompany transfer learn technique receive relatively little attention paper propose transfer learn set specialize semantic similarity refer direct network transfer experiment several standard text similarity datasets show apply direct network transfer exist encoders lead state-of-the-art performance additionally compare several approach transfer sentence encoders semantic similarity task show choice transfer learn set greatly affect performance many case differs encoder dataset
