 neural conversational model conversational modeling important task natural language understanding machine intelligence although previous approach exist often restrict specific domain e.g. book airline ticket require hand-crafted rule paper present simple approach task use recently propose sequence sequence framework model converse predict next sentence give previous sentence sentence conversation strength model train end-to-end thus require much few hand-crafted rule find straightforward model generate simple conversation give large conversational training dataset preliminary result suggest despite optimize wrong objective function model able converse well able extract knowledge domain specific dataset large noisy general domain dataset movie subtitle domain-specific helpdesk dataset model find solution technical problem via conversation noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset model perform simple form common sense reasoning expect also find lack consistency common failure mode model
