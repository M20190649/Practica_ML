 neural machine translation low-resource language neural machine translation nmt approach improve state art many machine translation setting last couple year require large amount training data produce sensible output demonstrate nmt use low-resource language well introduce local dependency use word alignment learn sentence reorder translation addition novel model also present empirical evaluation low-resource phrase-based statistical machine translation smt nmt investigate low limit respective technology find smt remain best option low-resource setting method produce acceptable translation token training data level baseline nmt system fail completely
