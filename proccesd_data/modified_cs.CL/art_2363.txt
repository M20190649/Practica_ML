 use generalized representation forget surface feature year ago state-of-the-art coreference resolvers use extensive amount surface feature recently paradigm shift towards use word embeddings deep neural network use surface feature limited paper show simple svm model surface feature outperform complex neural model detect anaphoric mention analysis suggest use generalized representation surface feature different strength take account improve coreference resolution
