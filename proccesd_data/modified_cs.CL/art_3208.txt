 text generation base generative adversarial net latent variable paper propose model use generative adversarial net gan generate realistic text instead use standard gan combine variational autoencoder vae generative adversarial net use high-level latent random variable helpful learn data distribution solve problem generative adversarial net always emit similar data propose vgan model generative model compose recurrent neural network vae discriminative model convolutional neural network train model via policy gradient apply propose model task text generation compare recent neural network base model recurrent neural network language model seqgan evaluate performance model calculate negative log-likelihood bleu score conduct experiment three benchmark datasets result show model outperform previous model
