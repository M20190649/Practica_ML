 improve entity link model latent relation mention entity link involves align textual mention named entity corresponding entry knowledge base entity link system often exploit relation textual mention document e.g. coreference decide linking decision compatible unlike previous approach rely supervised system heuristic predict relation treat relation latent variable neural entity-linking model induce relation without supervision optimize entity-linking system end-to-end fashion multi-relational model achieve best reported score standard benchmark aida-conll substantially outperform relation-agnostic version training also converge much faster suggest injected structural bias help explain regularity training data
