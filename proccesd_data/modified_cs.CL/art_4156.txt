 inject relational structural representation neural network question similarity effectively use full syntactic parse information neural network nns solve relational task e.g. question similarity still open problem paper propose inject structural representation nns learn svm model use tree kernel tks relatively pair question thousand gold standard g training data typically scarce ii predict label large corpus question pair iii pre-training nns large corpus result quora semeval question similarity datasets show nns train approach learn accurate model especially fine tune g
