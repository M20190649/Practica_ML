 language distribution prediction base batch markov monte carlo simulation migration language spreading complex mechanism involve issue like culture economics migration population etc paper propose set method model dynamic spreading system model randomness language spreading propose batch markov monte carlo simulation migration bmmcsm algorithm agent treat language stack agent learn language migrates base propose batch markov property accord transition matrix migration matrix m. since population play crucial role language spreading also introduce mortality fertility mechanism control birth death simulated agent bmmcsm algorithm simulation result bmmcsm show numerical geographic distribution language varies across time change distribution fit world cultural economic development trend next construct matrix entry directly calculate historical statistic entry unknown thus key success bmmcsm lie accurate estimation transition matrix estimate unknown entry supervision known entry achieve first construct factor tensor x characterize entry t. train random forest regressor known entry use trained regressor predict unknown entry reason choose random forest rf compare single decision tree conquer problem fitting shapiro test also suggest residual rf subject normal distribution
