 retrieval-based neural code generation model generate program source code natural language represent code tree structure common approach however exist method often fail generate complex code correctly due lack ability memorize large complex structure introduce recode method base subtree retrieval make possible explicitly reference exist code example within neural code generation model first retrieve sentence similar input sentence use dynamic-programming-based sentence similarity score method next extract n-grams action sequence build associate abstract syntax tree finally increase probability action cause retrieved n-gram action subtree predicted code show approach improve performance two code generation task bleu
