 deep active learning name entity recognition deep learning yield state-of-the-art performance many natural language processing task include name entity recognition ner however typically require large amount label data work demonstrate amount labeled training data drastically reduce deep learning combine active learning active learning sample-efficient computationally expensive since require iterative retraining speed introduce lightweight architecture ner viz. cnn-cnn-lstm model consist convolutional character word encoders long short term memory lstm tag decoder model achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance standard datasets task computationally much efficient best perform model carry incremental active learning training process able nearly match state-of-the-art performance original training data
