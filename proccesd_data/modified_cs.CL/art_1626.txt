 predicting explain human semantic search cognitive model recent work attempt characterize structure semantic memory search algorithm together best approximate human pattern search reveal semantic fluency task number model seek capture semantic search process network vary cognitive plausibility implementation exist work also neglect consider constraint incremental process language acquisition must place structure semantic memory present model incrementally update semantic network limited computational step replicate many pattern find human semantic fluency use simple random walk also perform thorough analysis show combination structural semantic feature correlate human performance pattern
