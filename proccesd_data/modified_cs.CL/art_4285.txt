 variational memory encoder-decoder introduce variability maintain coherence core task learn generate utterance conversation standard neural encoder-decoder model extension use conditional variational autoencoder often result either trivial digressive response overcome explore novel approach inject variability neural encoder-decoder via use external memory mixture model namely variational memory encoder-decoder vmed associate memory read mode latent mixture distribution timestep model capture variability observe sequential data natural conversation empirically compare proposed model recent approach various conversational datasets result show vmed consistently achieve significant improvement others metric-based qualitative evaluation
