 dynamic compositional neural network tree structure tree-structured neural network prove effective learn semantic representation exploit syntactic information spite success existing model suffer underfitting problem recursively use share compositional function throughout whole compositional process lack expressive power due inability capture richness compositionality paper address issue introduce dynamic compositional neural network tree structure dc-treenn compositional function dynamically generate meta network role meta-network capture metaknowledge across different compositional rule formulate experimental result two typical task show effectiveness propose model
