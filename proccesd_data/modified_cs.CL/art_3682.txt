 joint entity recognition relation extraction multi-head selection problem state-of-the-art model joint entity recognition relation extraction strongly rely external natural language processing nlp tool pos part-of-speech tagger dependency parser thus performance joint model depend quality feature obtain nlp tool however feature always accurate various language context paper propose joint neural model perform entity recognition relation extraction simultaneously without need manually extracted feature use external tool specifically model entity recognition task use crf conditional random field layer relation extraction task multi-head selection problem i.e. potentially identify multiple relation entity present extensive experimental setup demonstrate effectiveness method use datasets various context i.e. news biomedical real estate languages i.e. english dutch model outperform previous neural model use automatically extract feature perform within reasonable margin feature-based neural model even beat
