 interpret neural network near neighbor local model interpretation method explain individual prediction assign importance value input feature value often determine measure change confidence feature remove however confidence neural network robust measure model uncertainty issue make reliably judge importance input feature difficult address change test-time behavior neural network use deep k-nearest neighbor without harm text classification accuracy algorithm provide robust uncertainty metric use generate feature importance value result interpretation well align human perception baseline method finally use interpretation method analyze model prediction dataset annotation artifact
