 text segmentation character-level text embeddings learn word representation recently see much success computational linguistics however assume sequence word token input linguistic analysis often unjustified many language word segmentation non-trivial task naturally occur text sometimes mixture natural language string character data propose learn text representation directly raw character sequence train simple recurrent network predict next character text network use hidden layer evolve abstract representation character sequence see demonstrate usefulness learned text embeddings use feature supervised character level text segmentation label task recognizing span text contain programming language code use embeddings feature able substantially improve baseline use surface character n-grams
