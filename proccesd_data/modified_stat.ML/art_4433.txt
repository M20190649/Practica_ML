 data dependent kernel approximation use pseudo random fourier feature kernel method powerful flexible approach solve many problem machine learning due pairwise evaluation kernel method complexity kernel computation grow data size increase thus applicability kernel method limit large scale datasets random fourier feature rff propose scale kernel method solve large scale datasets approximate kernel function use randomize fourier feature method prove popular still exist shortcoming effectively use rff sample randomized feature distribution independent train data require sufficient large number feature expansion similar performance kernelized classifier proportional number sample dataset thus reduce number feature dimension necessary effectively scale large datasets paper propose kernel approximation method data dependent way coin pseudo random fourier feature prff reduce number feature dimension also improve prediction performance propose approach evaluate classification regression problem compare rff orthogonal random feature nystr approach
