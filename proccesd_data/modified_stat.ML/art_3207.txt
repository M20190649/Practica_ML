 marginalize gaussian process hyperparameters use sequential monte carlo gaussian process regression popular method non-parametric probabilistic modeling function gaussian process prior characterize so-called hyperparameters often large influence posterior model difficult tune work provide method numerical marginalization hyperparameters rely rigorous framework sequential monte carlo method well suit online problem demonstrate ability handle real-world problem several dimension compare marginalization method also conclude propose method competitive alternative commonly use point estimate maximize likelihood term computational load ability handle multimodal posterior
