 constrain -spectral cluster important form prior information cluster come form -link must-link constraint present generalization popular spectral clustering technique integrate constraint motivate recently propose -spectral clustering unconstrained problem method base tight relaxation constrain normalized cut continuous optimization problem opposite method suggest constrained spectral clustering always guarantee satisfy constraint moreover soft formulation allow optimize trade-off normalize cut number violated constraint efficient implementation provide scale large datasets outperform consistently propose method experiment
