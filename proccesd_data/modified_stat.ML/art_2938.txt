 estimate accuracy multiple classifier without label data various situation one give prediction multiple classifier large unlabeled test data scenario raise following question without label data without a-priori knowledge reliability different classifier possible consistently computationally efficiently estimate accuracy furthermore also completely unsupervised manner one construct accurate unsupervised ensemble classifier paper focus binary case present simple computationally efficient algorithm solve question furthermore standard classifier independence assumption prove method consistent study asymptotic error approach spectral base fact off-diagonal entry classifier covariance matrix -d tensor rank-one illustrate competitive performance algorithm via extensive experiment artificial real datasets
