 multi-task metric learning network data multi-task learning mtl improve prediction performance different context learn model jointly multiple different related task network data priori data rich relational structure provide important context apply mtl particular explicit relational structure implies network data i.i.d data network data also often come significant metadata i.e. attribute associate entity node moreover due diversity variation network data e.g. multi-relational link multi-category entity various task perform often rich correlation exists learn algorithm exploit additional source information good performance work take metric-learning point view mtl problem network context approach build structure preserve metric learn spml particular spml learn mahalanobis distance metric node attribute use network structure supervision learned distance function encode structure use predict link pattern attribute spml describe single-task learning single network herein propose multi-task version spml abbreviate mt-spml able learn across multiple related task multiple network via share intermediate parametrization mt-spml learn specific metric task common metric task task correlation carry common metric individual metric encode task specific information combine together structure-preserving respect individual task mt-spml work general network thus suitable wide variety problem experiment challenge mt-spml two real-word problem mt-spml achieves significant improvement
