 deep learning part-based representation data use sparse autoencoders nonnegativity constraint demonstrate new deep learning autoencoder network train nonnegativity constraint algorithm ncae learn feature show part-based representation data learning algorithm base constrain negative weight performance algorithm assess base decompose data part prediction performance test three standard image data set one text dataset result indicate nonnegativity constraint force autoencoder learn feature amount part-based representation data improve sparsity reconstruction quality comparison traditional sparse autoencoder nonnegative matrix factorization also show newly acquire representation improve prediction performance deep neural network
