 posterior sample reinforcement learn without episode brief technical note clarify issue apply application algorithm posterior sample reinforcement learn psrl environment without fixed episode particular paper aim review result prove finite horizon mdps osband et al b also mdps finite ergodic structure gopalan et al review similar result optimistic algorithm infinite horizon problem jaksch et al bartlett tewari abbasi-yadkori szepesvari particular attention dynamic episode growth highlight delicate technical issue lead fault proof lazy-psrl algorithm abbasi-yadkori szepesvari present explicit counterexample style argument therefore suggest theorem abbasi-yadkori szepesvari instead consider conjecture rigorous proof present pragmatic approach apply psrl infinite horizon problem conjecture additional assumption possible obtain bound sqrt even without episodic reset hope note serve clarify exist result field reinforcement learning provide interesting motivation future work
