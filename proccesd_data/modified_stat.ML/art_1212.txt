 statistical machine learn approach yield curve forecast yield curve forecasting important problem finance work explore use gaussian process conjunction dynamic modeling strategy much like kalman filter model yield curve gaussian process successfully apply model functional data variety application gaussian process use model yield curve hyper-parameters gaussian process model update algorithm receive yield curve data yield curve data typically available time series frequency one day compare exist method forecast yield curve propose method result study show compete method multivariate time series method perform well forecast yield short term structure region yield curve gaussian process perform well medium long term structure region yield curve accuracy long term structure region yield curve important practical implication gaussian process framework yield uncertainty probability estimate directly contrast compete method analyst frequently interested information study propose method apply yield curve forecasting however apply model high frequency time series data data stream domain
