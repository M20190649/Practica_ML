 optimization compressed sensing simplex method kronecker sparsification paper present two new approach efficiently solve large-scale compressed sensing problem two idea independent therefore use either separately together consider possibility first approach note zero vector take initial basic infeasible solution linear programming problem therefore true signal sparse variant simplex method expect take small number pivot arrive solution implement one variant demonstrate dramatic improvement computation time sparse signal second approach require redesigned sensing mechanism vector signal stack matrix allow u exploit kronecker compress sense kc mechanism show kronecker sense require strong condition perfect recovery compare original vector problem however kronecker sensing model correctly much sparse linear optimization problem hence algorithms benefit sparse problem representation interior-point method solve kronecker sense problem much faster corresponding vector problem numerical study demonstrate ten-fold improvement computation time
