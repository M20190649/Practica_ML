 efficient model selection gaussian mixture model bayesian framework order cluster partition data often use expectation-and-maximization em variational approximation gaussian mixture model gmm parametric probability density function represent weighted sum hat k gaussian component density however model selection find underlying hat k one key concern gmm clustering since obtain desired cluster hat k know paper propose new model selection algorithm explore hat k bayesian framework propose algorithm build density model order information criterion aic bic basically fail reconstruct addition algorithm reconstruct density quickly compare time-consuming monte carlo simulation
