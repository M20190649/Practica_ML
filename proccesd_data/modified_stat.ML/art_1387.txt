 mahalanonbis distance inform cluster fundamental question data analysis machine learning signal processing compare data point choice distance metric specifically challenge high-dimensional data set problem meaningfulness prominent e.g euclidean distance image paper propose exploit property high-dimensional data usually ignore structure stem relationship coordinate specifically show organize similar coordinate cluster exploit construction mahalanobis distance sample observable sample generate nonlinear transformation hidden variable mahalanobis distance allow recovery euclidean distance hidden space.we illustrate advantage approach synthetic example discovery cluster correlated coordinate improve estimation principal direction sample method apply real data gene expression lung adenocarcinoma lung cancer use propose metric find partition subject risk group good separation kaplan-meier survival plot
