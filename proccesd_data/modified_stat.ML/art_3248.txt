 sparse approximation kernel mean kernel mean frequently use represent probability distribution machine learning problem particular well know kernel density estimator kernel mean embed form kernel mean unfortunately kernel mean face scalability issue single point evaluation kernel density estimator example require computation time linear training sample size address challenge present method efficiently construct sparse approximation kernel mean first establish incoherence-based bound approximation error notice case radial kernel bound minimize solve k -center problem outcome linear time construction sparse kernel mean also lend naturally automatic sparsity selection scheme show computational gain method look three problem involve kernel mean euclidean embedding distribution class proportion estimation cluster use mean-shift algorithm
