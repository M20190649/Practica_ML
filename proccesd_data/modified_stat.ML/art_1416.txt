 learn low-dimensional metric paper investigate theoretical foundation metric learning focus three key question fully address prior work consider learn general low-dimensional low-rank metric well sparse metric develop upper low minimax bound generalization error quantify sample complexity metric learn term dimension feature space dimension rank underlying metric also bind accuracy learned metric relative underlie true generative metric result involve novel mathematical approach metric learning problem lso shed new light special case ordinal embed aka non-metric multidimensional scaling
