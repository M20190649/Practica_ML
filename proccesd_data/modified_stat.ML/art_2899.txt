 predict future behavior time-varying probability distribution study problem predict future though probabilistic sense estimate future state time-varying probability distribution interesting academic problem solve extrapolation problem also many practical application e.g train classifier operate time-varying condition main contribution method predict next step time-varying distribution give sequence sample set early time step rely two recent machine learn technique embed probability distribution reproducing kernel hilbert space learn operator vector-valued regression illustrate working principle practical usefulness method experiment synthetic real data also highlight exemplary application training classifier domain adaptation set without access example test time distribution training time
