 tree-cut probabilistic image segmentation paper present new probabilistic generative model image segmentation i.e task partition image homogeneous region model ground mid-level image representation call region tree region recursively split subregions superpixels reach give region tree image segmentation formalize sample cut tree model inference cut exact formulate use dynamic programming tree-cut model tune sample segmentation particular scale interest many possible multiscale image segmentation generalize common notion one correct segmentation per image also allow move beyond standard single-scale evaluation segmentation result image average corresponding set coarse fine human annotation conduct scale-specific evaluation quantitative result comparable lead gpb-owt-ucm method notable advantage additionally produce distribution possible tree-consistent segmentation image
