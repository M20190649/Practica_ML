 topological recurrent neural network diffusion prediction paper study problem use representation learn assist information diffusion prediction graph particular aim estimate probability inactive node activate next cascade despite success recent deep learning method diffusion find often underexplore cascade structure consider cascade merely sequence node order activation time stamp instead rich structure indicate diffusion process data graph result introduce new data model namely diffusion topology fully describe cascade structure find challenge model diffusion topology dynamic directed acyclic graph dag exist neural network therefore propose novel topological recurrent neural network namely topo-lstm model dynamic dag customize topo-lstm diffusion prediction task show improve state-of-the-art baseline -- map relatively across multiple real-world data set code data set available online http github.com vwz topolstm
