 quick sensitivity analysis incremental data modification application leave-one-out cv linear classification problem introduce novel sensitivity analysis framework large scale classification problem use small number instance incrementally add remove quickly update classifier situation incremental learn algorithm intensively study literature although much efficient solve optimization problem scratch computational complexity yet depend entire training set size mean original training set large completely solve incremental learning problem might still rather expensive circumvent computational issue propose novel framework allow u make inference updated classifier without actually re-optimizing specifically propose framework quickly provide low upper bound quantity unknown updated classifier main advantage propose framework computational cost compute bound depend number updated instance property quite advantageous typical sensitivity analysis task small number instance update paper demonstrate propose framework applicable various practical sensitivity analysis task bound provide framework often sufficiently tight make desired inference
