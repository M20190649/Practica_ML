 fast approximate spectral clustering dynamic network spectral clustering widely study problem yet complexity prohibitive dynamic graph even modest size claim possible reuse information past cluster assignment expedite computation approach build recent idea sidestep main bottleneck spectral clustering i.e. compute graph eigenvectors use fast chebyshev graph filtering random signal show propose algorithm achieve cluster assignment quality approximate spectral clustering yield significant complexity benefit graph dynamic appropriately bound
