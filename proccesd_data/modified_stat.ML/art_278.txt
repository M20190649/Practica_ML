 out-of-sample extension latent position graph consider problem vertex classification graph construct latent position model show previously approach embed graph euclidean space follow classification space yield universally consistent vertex classifier however major technical difficulty approach arise classify unlabeled out-of-sample vertex without include embedding stage paper study out-of-sample extension graph embed step impact subsequent inference task show latent position graph model sufficiently large n mapping out-of-sample vertex close true latent position demonstrate successful inference out-of-sample vertex possible
