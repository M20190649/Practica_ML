 distribute online big data classification use context information distribute online data mining system emerge result application require analysis large amount correlated high-dimensional data produce multiple distribute data source propose distributed online data classification framework data gather distribute data source process heterogeneous set distributed learner learn online run-time classify different data stream either use locally available classification function help classify 's data importantly since data gather different location send data another learner process incurs additional cost delay hence beneficial benefit obtain good classification exceed cost model problem joint classification distributed heterogeneous learner multiple data source distributed contextual bandit problem data characterize specific context develop distributed online learn algorithm prove sublinear regret compare prior work distributed online data mining work first provide analytic regret result characterize performance propose algorithm
