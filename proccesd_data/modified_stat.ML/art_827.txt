 inertial regularization selection irs sequential regression high-dimension sparsity paper develop new sequential regression model approach data stream data stream commonly find around u e.g retail enterprise sale data continuously collect every day demand forecast model important outcome data need continuously update new incoming data main challenge modeling arises high dimensional sparsity b need adaptive use prior knowledge c structural change system propose approach address challenge incorporate adaptive l -penalty inertia term loss function thus call inertial regularization selection irs former term performs model selection handle first challenge latter show address last two challenge recursive estimation algorithm develop show outperform commonly use state-space model kalman filter experimental study real data
