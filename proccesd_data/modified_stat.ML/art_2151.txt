 discriminative learning via semidefinite probabilistic model discriminative linear model popular tool machine learning generally divide two type first linear classifier support vector machine well study provide state-of-the-art result one shortcoming model output know 'margin calibrate translate naturally distribution label thus difficult incorporate model component large system unlike probabilistic base approach second type approach construct class conditional distribution use nonlinearity e.g log-linear model occasionally bad term classification error propose supervised learning method combine best approach specifically method provide distribution label linear function model parameter consequence difference probability linear function property probabilistic model e.g log-linear model assume class correspond linear subspace rather half space use relaxed projection operator construct measure evaluate degree give vector 'belongs subspace result distribution label interestingly view closely relate similar concept quantum detection theory result model train either maximize margin optimize average likelihood measure corresponding optimization problem semidefinite program solve efficiently illustrate performance algorithm real world datasets show outperform nd order kernel method
