 screening rule overlap group lasso recently solve large-scale lasso group lasso problem screen rule develop goal reduce problem size efficiently discard zero coefficient use simple rule independently others however screen overlap group lasso remain open challenge overlap group make infeasible test group independently paper develop screen rule overlap group lasso address challenge arise group overlap take account overlap group inclusive group test derive screen rule adopt dual polytope projection approach strategy allow u screen group independently experiment demonstrate efficiency screening rule various datasets
