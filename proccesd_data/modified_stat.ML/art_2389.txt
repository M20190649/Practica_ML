 accelerate em empirical study many application require learn parameter model data em method use learn parameter probabilistic model data variable model either miss hide instance method slow converge therefore several acceleration propose improve method none propose acceleration method theoretically dominant experimental comparison lack paper present different propose acceleration try compare experimentally result experiment argue acceleration em always possible acceleration superior depends property problem
