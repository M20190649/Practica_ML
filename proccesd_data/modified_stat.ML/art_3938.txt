 probabilistic dimensionality reduction via structure learn propose novel probabilistic dimensionality reduction framework naturally integrate generative model locality information data base framework present new model able learn smooth skeleton embed point low-dimensional space high-dimensional noisy data formulation new model equivalently interpret two couple learning problem i.e. structure learning learning projection matrix interpretation motivate learning embed point directly form explicit graph structure develop new method learn embed point form spanning tree extend obtain discriminative compact feature representation cluster problem unlike traditional clustering method assume center cluster close connect learned graph cluster center distant greatly facilitate data visualization scientific discovery downstream analysis extensive experiment perform demonstrate propose framework able obtain discriminative feature representation correctly recover intrinsic structure various real-world datasets
