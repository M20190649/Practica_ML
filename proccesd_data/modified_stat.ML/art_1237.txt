 distribution gaussian process arc length present first treatment arc length gaussian process gp single output dimension gps commonly use task trajectory modelling path length crucial quantity interest previously path one dimension consider theoretical consideration high dimensional problem fill gap exist literature derive moment arc length stationary gp multiple output dimension new method use derive mean one-dimensional gp finite interval consider distribution arc length integrand technique use derive approximate distribution arc length vector value gp mathbb r n moment match distribution numerical simulation confirm theoretical derivation
