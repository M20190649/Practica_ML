 parametric return density estimation reinforcement learn conventional reinforcement learn rl algorithms aim optimize decision-making rule term expected return however especially risk management purpose risk-sensitive criterion value-at-risk expect shortfall sometimes prefer real application describe parametric method estimate density return allow u handle various criterion unified manner first extend bellman equation conditional expected return cover conditional probability density return derive extension td-learning algorithm estimate return density unknown environment test instance several parametric density estimation algorithm present gaussian laplace skew laplace distribution show algorithm lead risk-sensitive well robust rl paradigm numerical experiment
