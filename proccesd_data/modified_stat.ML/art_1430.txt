 large-scale quadratically constrain quadratic program via low-discrepancy sequence consider problem solve large-scale quadratically constrain quadratic program problem occur naturally many scientific web application although efficient method tackle problem mostly scalable paper develop method transform quadratic constraint linear form sample set low-discrepancy point transformed problem solve apply state-of-the-art large-scale quadratic programming solver show convergence approximate solution true solution well finite sample error bound experimental result also show prove scalability well improve quality approximation practice
