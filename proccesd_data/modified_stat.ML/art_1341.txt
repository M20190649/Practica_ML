 model selection bayesian neural network via horseshoe prior bayesian neural network bnns recently receive increase attention ability provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainty however model selection -- -even choose number node -- -remains open question work apply horseshoe prior node pre-activations bayesian neural network effectively turn node help explain data demonstrate prior prevent bnn under-fitting even number node require grossly over-estimated moreover model selection number node n't come expense predictive computational performance fact learn small network comparable predictive performance current approach
