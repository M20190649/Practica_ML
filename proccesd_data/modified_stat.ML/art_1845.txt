 extension sbl algorithm recovery block sparse signal intra-block correlation examine recovery block sparse signal extend framework two important direction one exploit signal intra-block correlation generalize signal block structure propose two family algorithm base framework block sparse bayesian learn bsbl one family directly derive bsbl framework require knowledge block structure another family derive expand bsbl framework base weak assumption block structure use block structure completely unknown use algorithm show exploit intra-block correlation helpful improve recovery performance algorithm also shed light modify exist algorithm design new one exploit correlation improve performance
