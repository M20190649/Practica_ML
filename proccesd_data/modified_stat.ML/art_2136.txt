 estimate hessian back-propagating curvature work develop curvature propagation cp general technique efficiently compute unbiased approximation hessian function compute use computational graph cost roughly two gradient evaluation cp give rank- approximation whole hessian repeatedly apply give increasingly precise unbiased estimate entry hessian particular interest diagonal hessian general approach know exist efficient accurate show experiment cp turn work well practice give accurate estimate hessian neural network example relatively small amount work also apply cp score matching diagonal hessian play integral role score matching objective usually compute exactly use inefficient algorithm scale large complex model
