 local global inference high dimensional nonparanormal graphical model paper propose unified framework quantify local global inferential uncertainty high dimensional nonparanormal graphical model particular consider problem test presence single edge construct uniform confidence subgraph due presence unknown marginal transformation propose pseudo likelihood base inferential approach sharp contrast exist high dimensional score test method method free tune parameter give initial estimator extend scope exist likelihood base inferential framework furthermore propose u-statistic multiplier bootstrap method construct confidence subgraph show constructed subgraph contain true graph probability great give nominal level compare exist method construct confidence subgraphs method rely gaussian sub-gaussian assumption theoretical property propose inferential method verify thorough numerical experiment real data analysis
