 impact random model cluster similarity clustering central approach unsupervised learning cluster apply fundamental analysis quantitatively compare clustering comparison crucial evaluation cluster method well task consensus clustering often argue order establish baseline cluster similarity assess context random ensemble clustering prevailing assumption random cluster ensemble permutation model number size cluster fix however assumption necessarily hold practice example multiple run k-means cluster return clustering fixed number cluster cluster size distribution varies greatly derive corrected variant two cluster similarity measure rand index mutual information context two random cluster ensemble number size cluster vary addition study impact one-sided comparison scenario reference clustering consequence different random model illustrate use synthetic example handwrite recognition gene expression data demonstrate choice random model drastic impact ranking similar cluster pair evaluation cluster method respect random baseline thus choice random cluster model carefully justify
