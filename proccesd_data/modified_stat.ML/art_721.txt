 statistical property single linkage hierarchical cluster estimator distance-based hierarchical clustering hc method widely use unsupervised data analysis author take account uncertainty distance data incorporate statistical model uncertainty corruption noise pairwise distance investigate problem estimate hc unknown parameter measurement specifically focus single linkage hierarchical clustering slhc study geometry prove fairly reasonable condition probability distribution govern measurement slhc equivalent maximum partial profile likelihood estimation mpple information contain data ignored time show direct evaluation slhc maximum likelihood estimation mle pairwise distance yield consistent estimator consequently full mle expect perform good slhc get correct hc result ground truth metric
