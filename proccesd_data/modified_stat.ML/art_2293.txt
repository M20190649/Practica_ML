 sparse seismic imaging use variable projection consider important class signal processing problem signal interest know sparse recover data give auxiliary information data generate example sparse green 's function may recover seismic experimental data use sparsity optimization source signature know unfortunately practice information often missing must recover data along signal use deconvolution technique paper present novel methodology simultaneously solve sparse signal auxiliary parameter use recently propose variable projection technique main contribution combine variable projection sparsity promote optimization obtain efficient algorithm large-scale sparse deconvolution problem demonstrate algorithm seismic imaging example
