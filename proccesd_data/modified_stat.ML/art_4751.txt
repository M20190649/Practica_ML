 regret bound non-decomposable metric miss label consider problem recommend relevant label item give data point user particular interested practically important setting evaluation respect non-decomposable label performance metric like f measure training data miss label end propose generic framework give performance metric psi devise regularized objective function threshold value predict score vector threshold select positive show regret generalization error give metric psi bound ultimately estimation error certain underlying parameter particular derive regret bound three popular setting collaborative filtering b multilabel classification c pu positive-unlabeled learning problem obtain precise non-asymptotic regret bound small even large fraction label miss empirical result synthetic benchmark datasets demonstrate explicitly model miss label optimize desired performance metric algorithm indeed achieve significantly good performance like f score compare method model miss label information carefully
