 joint estimation linear non-gaussian acyclic model linear non-gaussian structural equation model call lingam identifiable model exploratory causal analysis previous method estimate causal ordering variable connection strength base single dataset however many application domain data obtain different condition multiple datasets obtain rather single dataset paper present new method jointly estimate multiple lingam assumption model share causal order may different connection strength differently distribute variable simulation new method estimate model accurately estimate separately
