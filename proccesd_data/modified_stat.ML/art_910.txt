 fast information-theoretic bayesian optimisation information-theoretic bayesian optimisation technique demonstrate state-of-the-art performance tackle important global optimisation problem however current information-theoretic approach require many approximation implementation introduce often-prohibitive computational overhead limit choice kernel available model objective develop fast information-theoretic bayesian optimisation method fitbo avoid need sample global minimiser thus significantly reduce computational overhead moreover comparison exist approach method face few constraint kernel choice enjoy merit deal output space demonstrate empirically fitbo inherit performance associate information-theoretic bayesian optimisation even faster simple bayesian optimisation approach expect improvement
