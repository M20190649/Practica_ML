 fast guarantee tensor decomposition via sketch tensor candecomp parafac cp decomposition wide application statistical learning latent variable model data mining paper propose fast randomized tensor cp decomposition algorithm base sketching build idea count sketch introduce many novel idea unique tensor develop novel method randomized computation tensor contraction via ffts without explicitly form tensor tensor contraction encounter decomposition method tensor power iteration alternate least square also design novel colliding hash symmetric tensor save time compute sketch combine sketch idea exist whitening tensor power iterative technique obtain fast algorithm sparse dense tensor quality approximation method depend property sparsity uniformity element etc apply method topic modeling obtain competitive result
