 large linear multi-output gaussian process learn gaussian process gps distribution arbitrary function continuous domain generalize multi-output case linear model coregionalization lmc one approach lmcs estimate exploit correlation across multiple output model estimation perform efficiently single-output gps assume stationarity multi-output case cross-covariance interaction stationary propose large linear gp llgp circumvent need stationarity induce structure lmc kernel common grid input share output enable optimization gp hyperparameters multi-dimensional output low-dimensional input apply synthetic two-dimensional real time series data find theoretical improvement relative current solution multi-output gps realize llgp reduce training time improve maintain predictive mean accuracy moreover use direct likelihood approximation rather variational one model confidence estimate significantly improve
