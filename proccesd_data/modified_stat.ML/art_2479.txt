 locally linear representation image cluster key construct similarity graph graph-oriented subspace learning clustering similarity graph vertex denote data point edge weight represent similarity two point two popular scheme construct similarity graph i.e. pairwise distance base scheme linear representation base scheme exist work involved one scheme suffer limitation specifically pairwise distance base method sensitive noise outlier compare linear representation base method hand possibility linear representation base algorithms wrongly select inter-subspaces point represent point degrade performance paper propose algorithm call locally linear representation llr integrate pairwise distance linear representation together address problem propose algorithm automatically encode data point set point could denote objective point less residual error also close point euclidean space experimental result show approach promise subspace learning subspace clustering
