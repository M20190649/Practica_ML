 adjust leverage score row weighting practical approach coherent matrix completion low-rank matrix completion important problem extensive real-world application observation uniformly sample underlie matrix entry exist method require matrix incoherent paper provide first working method coherent matrix completion standard uniform sample model approach base weighted nuclear norm minimization idea propose several recent work key contribution practical method compute weighting matrix leverage score become uniform weight suitable condition able derive theoretical result show effectiveness approach experiment synthetic data show approach recovers highly coherent matrix high precision whereas standard unweighted method fails even noise-free data
