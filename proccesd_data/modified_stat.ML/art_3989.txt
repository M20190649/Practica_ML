 homotopy analysis tensor pca develop efficient guaranteed nonconvex algorithm important challenge modern machine learning algorithm good empirical performance stochastic gradient descent often lack theoretical guarantee paper analyze class homotopy continuation method global optimization nonconvex function method start objective function efficient optimize e.g convex progressively modify obtain required objective solution pass along homotopy path challenging problem tensor pca prove global convergence homotopy method high noise regime signal-to-noise requirement algorithm tight sense match recovery guarantee best degree- sum-of-squares algorithm addition prove phase transition along homotopy path tensor pca allow simplify homotopy method local search algorithm viz. tensor power iteration specific initialization noise injection procedure retain theoretical guarantee
