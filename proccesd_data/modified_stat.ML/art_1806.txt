 positive definite matrix s-divergence positive definite matrix abound dazzling variety application ubiquity part attribute rich geometric structure positive definite matrix form self-dual convex cone whose strict interior riemannian manifold manifold view endow natural distance function conic view nevertheless draw motivation conic view introduce s-divergence natural distance-like function open cone positive definite matrix motivate s-divergence via sequence result connect riemannian distance particular show divergence square distance b several geometric property similar riemannian distance though without computationally demanding s-divergence even intriguing although nonconvex still compute matrix mean median use global optimality complement result numerical experiment illustrate theorem optimization algorithm compute matrix median
