 score-based causal learn additive noise model give data sample number variable one often interested underlying causal relationship form directed acyclic graph general case without intervention variable possible identify graph markov equivalence class however situation one find true causal graph observational data example structural equation model additive noise nonlinear edge function current method achieve rely nonparametric independence test one problem null hypothesis independence one would like get evidence take different approach work use penalized likelihood score model selection practically feasible many setting advantage yield natural ranking candidate model make smoothness assumption probability density space prove consistency penalized maximum likelihood estimator also present empirical result simulated scenario real two-dimensional data set cause-effect pair obtain similar result state-of-the-art method
