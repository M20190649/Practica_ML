 local loss optimization operator model new insight spectral learn paper re-visits spectral method learn latent variable model define term observable operator give new perspective method show operator recover minimize loss define finite subset domain non-convex optimization similar spectral method derive also propose regularized convex relaxation optimization show practice availabilty continuous regularization parameter contrast discrete number state original method allow good trade-off accuracy model complexity also prove general randomized strategy choose local loss succeed high probability
