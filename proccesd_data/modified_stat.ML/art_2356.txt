 classifier learn supervised marginal likelihood argue supervised classification task practice may sensible perform model selection respect focused model selection score like supervised conditional marginal likelihood respect standard marginal likelihood criterion however bayesian network model compute supervised marginal likelihood score take exponential time respect amount observe data paper consider diagnostic bayesian network classifier significant model parameter represent conditional distribution class variable give value predictor variable case supervise marginal likelihood compute linear time respect data number model parameter grow case exponentially respect number predictor focus simple diagnostic model number relevant predictor small suggest two approach apply type model classification first approach base mixture simple diagnostic model second approach apply small predictor set simple diagnostic model augment naive bayes classifier
