 adaptive stratify sample monte-carlo integration differentiable function consider problem adaptive stratified sampling monte carlo integration differentiable function give finite number evaluation function construct sampling scheme sample often region function oscillate allocate sample well spread domain notion share similitude low discrepancy prove estimate return algorithm almost similarly accurate estimate optimal oracle strategy would know variation function everywhere would return provide finite-sample analysis
