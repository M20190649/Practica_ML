 multispectral hyperspectral image fusion use -d-convolutional neural network paper propose method use three dimensional convolutional neural network -d-cnn fuse together multispectral m hyperspectral h image obtain high resolution hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction hyperspectral image perform prior fusion order significantly reduce computational time make method robust noise experiment perform data set simulate use real hyperspectral image result obtain show propose approach promising compare conventional method especially true hyperspectral image corrupt additive noise
