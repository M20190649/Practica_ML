 reference distance estimator theoretical study present simple linear classifier call reference distance estimator rde assign weight feature j p r j -p r r reference feature relevant target class y. analysis show r performs well random guess predict conditionally independent feature j rde classification performance p j -p classifier train gold standard y. since estimation p r j -p r require label data assumption rde train large number unlabeled example would close train infinite label example case assumption hold theoretically analyze factor influence closeness rde perfect one assumption present algorithm select reference feature combine multiple rdes different reference feature use label unlabeled data experimental result text classification task show semi-supervised learning method improve supervise method use label example million unlabeled one many task performance even close classifier train million labeled example addition bound theorem provide good estimation classification performance useful new algorithm design
