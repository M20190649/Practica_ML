 graph-based approach cluster network-constrained trajectory data even though cluster trajectory data attract considerable attention last year prior work assume move object move freely euclidean space consider eventual presence underlie road network influence evaluate similarity trajectory paper present two approach cluster network-constrained trajectory data first approach discover cluster trajectory travel along part road network second approach segment-oriented aim group together road segment base trajectory common approach use graph model depict interaction observation w.r.t similarity cluster similarity graph use community detection algorithm also present experimental result obtain synthetic data showcase proposition
