 robust bayesian compress sense consider problem robust compress sense whose objective recover high-dimensional sparse signal compress measurement corrupt outlier new sparse bayesian learning method develop robust compress sensing basic idea propose method identify remove outlier sparse signal recovery automatically identify outlier employ set binary indicator hyperparameters indicate observation outlier indicator hyperparameters treat random variable assign beta process prior value confine binary addition gaussian-inverse gamma prior impose sparse signal promote sparsity base hierarchical prior model develop variational bayesian method estimate indicator hyperparameters well sparse signal simulation result show propose method achieve substantial performance improvement exist robust compress sense technique
