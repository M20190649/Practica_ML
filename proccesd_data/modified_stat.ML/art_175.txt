 adaptive hedge method decision-theoretic online learning base hedge algorithm take parameter call learning rate previous analyse learning rate carefully tune obtain optimal worst-case performance lead suboptimal performance easy instance example exist action significantly good others propose new way set learning rate adapt difficulty learning problem bad case procedure still guarantee optimal performance easy instance achieve much small regret particular adaptive method achieves constant regret probabilistic setting exist action average obtains strictly small loss action also provide simulation study compare approach exist method
