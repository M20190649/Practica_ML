 tensor decomposition via variational auto-encoder tensor decomposition important technique capture high-order interaction among multiway data multi-linear tensor composition method tucker decomposition candecomp parafac cp assume complex interaction among object multi-linear thus insufficient represent nonlinear relationship data another assumption method predefined rank know however rank tensor hard estimate especially case miss value address issue design bayesian generative model tensor decomposition different traditional bayesian method high-order interaction tensor entry model variational auto-encoder propose model take advantage neural network nonparametric bayesian model replace multi-linear product traditional bayesian tensor decomposition complex nonlinear function via neural network whose parameter learn data experimental result synthetic data real-world chemometrics tensor data demonstrate new model achieve significantly high prediction performance state-of-the-art tensor decomposition approach
