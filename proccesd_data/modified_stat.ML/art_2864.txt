 feature selection linear svm provable guarantee give two provably accurate feature-selection technique linear svm algorithm run deterministic randomized time respectively algorithm use unsupervised supervised setting supervised approach base sample feature support vector prove margin feature space preserve within epsilon -relative error margin full feature space worst-case unsupervised setting also provide worst-case guarantee radius minimum enclosing ball thereby ensure comparable generalization full feature space resolve open problem pose dasgupta et al present extensive experiment real-world datasets support theory demonstrate method competitive often good prior state-of-the-art known provable guarantee
