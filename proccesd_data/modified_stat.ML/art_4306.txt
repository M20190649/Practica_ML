 dimension reduction high-dimensional datasets base stepwise svm current study propose dimension reduction method stepwise support vector machine svm reduce dimension large p small n datasets propose method compare dimension reduction method namely pearson product difference correlation coefficient pccs recursive feature elimination base random forest rf-rfe principal component analysis pca use five gene expression datasets additionally prediction performance variable select method evaluate study find stepwise svm effectively select important variable achieve good prediction performance moreover prediction stepwise svm reduced datasets well unreduced datasets performance stepwise svm stable pca rf-rfe performance difference respect pccs minimal necessary reduce dimension large p small n datasets believe stepwise svm effectively eliminate noise data improve prediction accuracy large p small n dataset
