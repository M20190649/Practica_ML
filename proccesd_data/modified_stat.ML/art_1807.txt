 asymptotically independent markov sampling new mcmc scheme bayesian inference bayesian statistic many problem express evaluation expectation quantity interest respect posterior distribution standard monte carlo method often applicable encountered posterior distribution sample directly case popular strategy importance sample method markov chain monte carlo anneal paper introduce new scheme bayesian inference call asymptotically independent markov sample aim base method derive important ergodic property aim particular show certain condition aim algorithm produce uniformly ergodic markov chain choice free parameter algorithm discuss recommendation provide choice theoretically heuristically base efficiency aim demonstrate three numerical example include multi-modal higher-dimensional target posterior distribution
