 use multiple sample learn mixture model mixture model problem assume k distribution theta ldots theta k one get observe sample mixture distribution unknown coefficient goal associate instance generating distribution identify parameter hidden distribution work make assumption access several sample draw k underlying distribution different mix weight topic modeling multiple sample often reasonable assumption instead pool data one sample prove possible use difference sample better recover underlying structure present algorithm recover underlying structure milder assumption current state art either dimensionality separation high method apply topic modeling allow generalization word present training data
