 bayesian rise tree hierarchical structure ubiquitous data across many domain many hierarchical cluster method frequently use domain expert strive discover structure however method limit discoverable hierarchy binary branching structure limitation computationally convenient often undesirable paper explore bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm produce tree arbitrary branching structure node know rise tree interpret tree mixture partition data set use computationally efficient greedy agglomerative algorithm find rise tree high marginal likelihood give data lastly perform experiment demonstrate rise tree good model data typical binary tree return hierarchical cluster algorithm
