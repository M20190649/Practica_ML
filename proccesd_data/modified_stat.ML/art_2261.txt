 perturbed variation introduce new discrepancy score two distribution give indication similarity much research do determine two sample come exactly distribution much less research consider problem determine two finite sample come similar distribution new score give intuitive interpretation similarity optimally perturb distribution best fit score define distribution efficiently estimate sample provide convergence bound estimate score develop hypothesis test procedure test two data set come similar distribution statistical power procedure present simulation also compare score 's capacity detect similarity know measure real data
