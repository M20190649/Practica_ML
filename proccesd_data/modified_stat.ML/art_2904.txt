 reinforcement imitation learning via interactive no-regret learning recent work demonstrate problem -- particularly imitation learning structured prediction -- learner 's prediction influence input-distribution test naturally address interactive approach analyze use no-regret online learning approach imitation learning however neither require benefit information cost action extend exist result two direction first develop interactive imitation learn approach leverage cost information second extend technique address reinforcement learning result provide theoretical support commonly observed success online approximate policy iteration approach suggest broad new family algorithm provide unifying view exist technique imitation reinforcement learning
