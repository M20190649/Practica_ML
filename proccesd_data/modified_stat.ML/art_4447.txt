 semi-supervised active few-shot learning prototypical network consider problem semi-supervised few-shot classification classifier need adapt new task use labeled example potentially many unlabeled example propose clustering approach problem feature extract prototypical network cluster use k -means labeled example guide clustering process note many real-world application adaptation performance significantly improve request label user feedback demonstrate good performance active adaptation strategy use image data
