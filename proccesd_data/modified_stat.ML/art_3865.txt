 exact clustering weighted graph via semidefinite programming model problem cluster consider dense k-disjoint-clique problem partition weighted complete graph k disjoint subgraphs sum density subgraphs maximize establish subgraphs recover solution particular semidefinite relaxation high probability input graph sample distribution clusterable graph specifically semidefinite relaxation exact graph consist k large disjoint subgraphs correspond cluster weight concentrate within subgraphs plus moderate number outlier establish noise weakly obscure cluster i.e between-cluster edge assign small weight recover significantly small cluster example show approximately sparse graph between-cluster weight tend zero size n graph tend infinity recover cluster size polylogarithmic n. empirical evidence numerical simulation also provide support theoretical phase transition perfect recovery cluster structure
