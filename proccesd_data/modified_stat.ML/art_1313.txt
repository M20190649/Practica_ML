 accelerate inference latent variable model inference latent feature model bayesian nonparametric setting generally difficult especially high dimensional setting usually require propose feature prior distribution special case integration tractable could sample new feature assignment accord predictive likelihood however still may efficient high dimension present novel method accelerate mixing latent variable model inference propose feature location data oppose prior first introduce accelerated feature proposal mechanism show valid bayesian inference algorithm next propose approximate inference strategy perform accelerated inference parallel sampling method efficient proper mixing markov chain monte carlo sampler computationally attractive theoretically guarantee converge posterior distribution limit distribution
