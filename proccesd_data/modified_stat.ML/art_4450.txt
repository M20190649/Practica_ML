 npc neighbor progressive competition algorithm classification imbalanced data set learn many real-world datasets limit problem call class imbalance problem dataset imbalanced one class majority class significantly sample class minority class datasets cause typical machine learn algorithm perform poorly classification task overcome issue paper propose new approach neighbor progressive competition npc classification imbalanced datasets whilst propose algorithm inspire weighted k-nearest neighbor k-nn algorithm major difference unlike k- nn npc limit decision criterion preset number near neighbor contrast npc considers progressively neighbor query sample decision making sum grade one class much high class furthermore npc use novel method grade training sample compensate imbalance issue grade calculate use local global information brief contribution paper entirely new classifier handle imbalance issue effectively without manually-set parameter need expert knowledge experimental result compare propose approach five representative algorithm apply fifteen imbalanced datasets illustrate algorithms effectiveness
