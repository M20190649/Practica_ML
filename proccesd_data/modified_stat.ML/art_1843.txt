 bayesian active learning classification preference learn information theoretic active learning widely study probabilistic model simple regression optimal myopic policy easily tractable however task complex model classification nonparametric model optimal solution hard compute current approach make approximation achieve tractability propose approach express information gain term predictive entropy apply method gaussian process classifier gpc approach make minimal approximation full information theoretic objective experimental performance compare favourably many popular active learning algorithm equal low computational complexity compare well decision theoretic approach also privy information require much computational time secondly develop reformulation binary preference learn classification problem extend algorithm gaussian process preference learning
