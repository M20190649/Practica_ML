 message passing algorithm problem path packing graph consider problem pack node-disjoint directed path directed graph consider variant problem path start within fixed subset root node subject give bound length path problem motivate so-called kidney exchange problem potential application interest right propose new algorithm problem base message pass belief propagation technique priori problem associated graphical model order apply belief propagation algorithm provide novel representation problem graphical model standard belief propagation model poor scale behavior provide efficient implementation significantly decrease complexity provide numerical result compare performance algorithm artificially create graph real world network several alternative algorithm include algorithm base integer program ip technique comparison show algorithm scale good large instance ip-based algorithm often find well solution simple algorithm greedily select long path root node case also find well solution one find ip-based algorithm even latter allow run significantly long algorithm
