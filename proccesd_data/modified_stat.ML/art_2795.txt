 automatic construction natural-language description nonparametric regression model paper present beginning automatic statistician focus regression problem system explore open-ended space statistical model discover good explanation data set produce detailed report figure natural-language text approach treat unknown regression function nonparametrically use gaussian process two important consequence first gaussian process model function term high-level property e.g smoothness trend periodicity changepoints take together compositional structure language model allow u automatically describe function simple term second use flexible nonparametric model rich language compose open-ended manner also result state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluate real time series data set various domain
