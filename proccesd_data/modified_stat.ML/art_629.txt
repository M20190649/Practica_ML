 bayesian nonparametric kernel-learning kernel method ubiquitous tool machine learning however often little reason common practice select kernel priori even universal approximating kernel select quality finite sample estimator may greatly affect choice kernel furthermore directly apply kernel method one typically need compute n time n gram matrix pairwise kernel evaluation work dataset n instance computation gram matrix preclude direct application kernel method large datasets make kernel learn especially difficult paper introduce bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning bank generic data-driven framework scalable learning kernel bank place nonparametric prior spectral distribution random frequency allow learn kernel scale large datasets show framework use large scale regression classification task furthermore show bank outperforms several scalable approach kernel learn variety real world datasets
