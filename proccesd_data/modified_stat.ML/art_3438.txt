 optimal model-free prediction multivariate time series forecast time series multivariate predictor constitute challenging problem especially use model-free approach technique nearest-neighbor prediction quickly suffer curse dimensionality overfitting predictor limit application mostly univariate case therefore selection strategy need harness available information efficiently possible since often right combination predictor matter ideally subset possible predictor test predictive power exponentially grow number combination make approach computationally prohibitive prediction scheme overcome strong limitation introduce utilize causal pre-selection step drastically reduce number possible predictor predictive set causal driver make globally optimal search scheme tractable information-theoretic optimality derive practical selection criterion discuss demonstrate multivariate nonlinear stochastic delay process optimal scheme even less computationally expensive commonly use sub-optimal scheme like forward selection method suggest general framework apply optimal model-free approach select variable subsequently fit model improve prediction learn statistical dependency performance framework illustrate climatological index el ni southern oscillation
