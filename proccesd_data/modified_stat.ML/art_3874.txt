 joint stochastic approximation learning helmholtz machine though progress model learning perform posterior inference still remain common challenge use deep generative model especially handle discrete hidden variable paper mainly concern algorithm learn helmholz machine characterize pair generative model auxiliary inference model common drawback previous learn algorithm indirectly optimize bound targeted marginal log-likelihood contrast successfully develop new class algorithm base stochastic approximation sa theory robbins-monro type directly optimize marginal log-likelihood simultaneously minimize inclusive kl-divergence result learning algorithm thus call joint sa jsa moreover construct effective mcmc operator jsa result mnist datasets demonstrate jsa 's performance consistently superior compete algorithm like rws learn range difficult model
