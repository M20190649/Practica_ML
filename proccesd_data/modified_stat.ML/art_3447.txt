 fairness-aware learning restriction universal dependency use f-divergences fairness-aware learning novel framework classification task like regular empirical risk minimization erm aim learn classifier low error rate time prediction classifier independent sensitive feature gender religion race ethnicity exist method achieve low dependency give sample guarantee unseen sample exist fairness-aware learning algorithms employ different dependency measure algorithm specifically design particular one diversity make difficult theoretically analyze compare paper propose general framework fairness-aware learning use f-divergences cover dependency measure employ exist method introduce way estimate f-divergences allow u give unified analysis upper bound estimation error bound tight exist convergence rate analysis divergence estimation divergence estimate propose fairness-aware learning algorithm perform theoretical analysis generalization error analysis reveals mild assumption even enforcement fairness generalization error method sqrt n regular erm addition importantly show f-divergence upper bound estimation error divergence sqrt n indicate fairness-aware learning algorithm guarantee low dependency unseen sample dependency measure represent f-divergence
