 unimodal bandit regret low bound optimal algorithm consider stochastic multi-armed bandit expect reward unimodal function partially order arm important class problem recently investigate cope yu set arm either discrete case arm correspond vertex finite graph whose structure represent similarity reward continuous case arm belong bound interval discrete unimodal bandit derive asymptotic low bound regret achieve algorithm propose osub algorithm whose regret match low bound algorithm optimally exploit unimodal structure problem surprisingly asymptotic regret depend number arm also provide regret upper bound osub non-stationary environment expected reward smoothly evolve time analytical result support numerical experiment show osub performs significantly good state-of-the-art algorithm continuous set arm provide brief discussion show combine appropriate discretization set arm ucb algorithm yield order-optimal regret practice outperforms recently propose algorithm design exploit unimodal structure
