 convex risk minimization conditional probability estimation paper prove general setting convex risk minimization procedure select unique conditional probability model determine classification problem unlike previous work give result general enough include case minimum exist occurs typically instance standard boost algorithm concretely first show sequence predictor minimize convex risk source distribution converge unique model class predictor linear potentially infinite dimension secondly show result hold emph empirical risk minimization whenever class predictor finite dimensional essential technical contribution norm-free generalization bound
