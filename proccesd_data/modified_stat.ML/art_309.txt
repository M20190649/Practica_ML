 noisy sparse subspace cluster paper consider problem subspace cluster noise specifically study behavior sparse subspace cluster ssc either adversarial random noise add unlabelled input data point assume union low-dimensional subspace show modified version ssc emph provably effective correctly identify underlying subspace even noisy data extend theoretical guarantee algorithm practical setting provide justification success ssc class real application
