 nonparametric canonical correlation analysis canonical correlation analysis cca classical representation learning technique find correlated variable multi-view data several nonlinear extension original linear cca propose include kernel deep neural network method approach seek maximally correlate projection among family function user specifies choose kernel neural network structure computationally demand interestingly theory nonlinear cca without functional restriction study population setting lancaster already result inspire practical algorithm revisit lancaster 's theory devise practical algorithm nonparametric cca ncca specifically show solution express term singular value decomposition certain operator associate joint density view thus estimate population density data ncca reduces solve eigenvalue system superficially like kernel cca importantly without require inversion kernel matrix also derive partially linear cca plcca variant one view undergo linear projection nonparametric use kernel density estimate base small number near neighbor ncca plcca algorithm memory-efficient often run much faster perform good kernel cca comparable deep cca
