 preference completion large-scale collaborative ranking pairwise comparison paper consider collaborative rank setting pool user provide small number pairwise preference possible item need predict preference user item yet see fit rank r score matrix pairwise data provide two main contribution show algorithm base convex optimization provide good generalization guarantee user provide r log pairwise comparison -- essentially match sample complexity require related matrix completion set use actual numerical oppose pairwise information b develop large-scale non-convex implementation call altsvm train factored form matrix via alternate minimization show reduces alternate svm problem scale parallelize well large problem setting also outperform common baseline many moderately large popular collaborative filter datasets ndcg measure rank performance
