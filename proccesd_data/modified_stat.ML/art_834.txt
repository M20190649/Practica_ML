 poisson intensity estimation reproduce kernel despite fundamental nature inhomogeneous poisson process theory application stochastic process attractive generalization e.g cox process tractable nonparametric model approach intensity function exist especially observed point lie high-dimensional space paper develop new computationally tractable reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhs formulation inhomogeneous poisson process model square root intensity rkhs function whereas rkhs model use supervised learn rely so-called representer theorem form inhomogeneous poisson process likelihood mean representer theorem apply however prove representer theorem hold appropriately transformed rkhs guarantee optimization penalized likelihood cast tractable finite-dimensional problem result approach simple implement readily scale high dimension large-scale datasets
