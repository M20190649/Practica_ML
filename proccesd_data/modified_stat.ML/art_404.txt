 efficient search strategy aggregation discretization attribute bayesian network use minimum description length bayesian network convenient graphical expression high dimensional probability distribution represent complex relationship large number random variable employ extensively area bioinformatics artificial intelligence diagnosis risk management recovery structure network data prime importance purpose modeling analysis prediction recovery algorithm literature assume either discrete continuous gaussian data general continuous data discretization usually employ often destroy structure one recover friedman goldszmidt suggest approach base minimum description length principle choose discretization preserve information original data set however one difficult impossible implement even moderately sized network paper provide extremely efficient search strategy allow one use friedman goldszmidt discretization practice
