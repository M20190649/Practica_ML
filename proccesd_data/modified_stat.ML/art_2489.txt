 convergence consistency blur mean-shift process mean-shift algorithm popular algorithm computer vision image processing also cast minimum gamma-divergence estimation paper focus blurring mean shift algorithm one version mean-shift process successively blur dataset analysis blur mean-shift relatively complicated compare nonblurring version yet algorithm convergence estimation consistency well study literature paper prove convergence consistency blur mean-shift also perform simulation study compare efficiency blurring nonblurring version mean-shift algorithm result show blur mean-shift efficiency
