 parallel markov chain monte carlo indian buffet process indian buffet process base model elegant way discover underlying feature within data set inference model slow infer underlie feature use markov chain monte carlo either relies uncollapsed representation lead poor mixing collapsed representation lead quadratic increase computational complexity exist attempt distribute inference introduce additional approximation within inference procedure paper present novel algorithm perform asymptotically exact parallel markov chain monte carlo inference indian buffet process model take advantage fact feature conditionally independent beta-bernoulli process conditional independence partition feature two part one part contain finitely many instantiated feature part contain infinite tail uninstantiated feature finite partition parallel inference simple give instantiation feature infinite tail perform uncollapsed mcmc lead poor mixing hence collapse feature result hybrid sampler parallel produce sample asymptotically true posterior
