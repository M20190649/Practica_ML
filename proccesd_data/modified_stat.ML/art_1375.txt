 transfer learn label noise transfer learn aim improve learning target domain borrow knowledge related different source domain reduce distribution shift source target domain recent method focus explore invariant representation similar distribution across domain however learn invariant knowledge exist method assume label source domain uncontaminated reality often access source data noisy label paper first show label noise adversely affect learning invariant representation correcting label shift various transfer learn scenario reduce adverse effect propose novel denoising conditional invariant component dcic framework provably ensure extract invariant representation give example noisy label source domain unlabeled example target domain estimate label distribution target domain bias experimental result synthetic real-world data verify effectiveness propose method
