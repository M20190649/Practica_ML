 asymptotic accuracy bayesian estimation single latent variable data science machine learning hierarchical parametric model mixture model often use contain two kind variable observable variable represent part data directly measure latent variable represent underlying process generate data although increase research estimation accuracy observable variable theoretical analysis estimate latent variable thoroughly investigate previous study determine accuracy bayes estimation joint probability latent variable dataset prove bayes method asymptotically accurate maximum-likelihood method however accuracy bayes estimation single latent variable remain unknown present paper derive asymptotic expansion error function define kullback-leibler divergence two type single-variable estimation statistical regularity satisfied result indicate accuracy bayes maximum-likelihood method asymptotically equivalent clarify bayes method advantageous multivariable estimation
