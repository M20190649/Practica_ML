 dirichlet process mixture generalized linear model propose dirichlet process mixture generalized linear model dp-glm new method nonparametric regression accommodate continuous categorical input response model generalized linear model prove condition asymptotic unbiasedness dp-glm regression mean function estimate also give example condition hold include model compactly support continuous distribution model continuous covariates categorical response empirically analyze property dp-glm provide good result exist dirichlet process mixture regression model evaluate dp-glm several data set compare modern method nonparametric regression like cart bayesian tree gaussian process compare exist technique dp-glm provide single model correspond inference algorithm perform well many regression setting
