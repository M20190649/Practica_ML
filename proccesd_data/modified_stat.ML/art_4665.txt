 constrained dantzig selector enhanced consistency dantzig selector receive popularity many application compressed sensing sparse modeling thanks computational efficiency linear programming problem nice sampling property exist result show recover sparse signal mimic accuracy ideal procedure logarithmic factor dimensionality factor show hold many regularization method important question whether factor reduce logarithmic factor sample size ultra-high dimension mild regularity condition provide affirmative answer paper suggest constrained dantzig selector flexible constraint parameter space prove suggested method achieve convergence rate within logarithmic factor sample size oracle rate improved sparsity fairly weak assumption signal strength improvement significant ultra-high dimension method implement efficiently sequential linear programming numerical study confirm sample size need certain level accuracy problem much reduce
