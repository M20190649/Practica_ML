 active tolerant test work give first algorithm tolerant testing nontrivial class active model estimate distance target function hypothesis class c respect arbitrary distribution use small number label query polynomial-sized pool unlabeled example draw d. specifically show class union interval line estimate error rate best hypothesis class additive error epsilon frac epsilon log frac epsilon label query unlabeled pool size frac epsilon log frac epsilon key point number label need independent vc-dimension class extend work balcan et al solve non-tolerant testing problem class distinguish zero-error case case best hypothesis class error great epsilon also consider related problem estimate performance give learning algorithm setting give large pool unlabeled example draw distribution label query estimate well would perform entire dataset label focus k-nearest neighbor style algorithm also show result apply problem hyperparameter tune select best value k give learning problem
