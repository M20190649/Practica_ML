 angle-based joint individual variation explain integrative analysis disparate data block measure common set experimental subject major challenge modern data analysis data structure naturally motivate simultaneous exploration joint individual variation within data block result new insight instance strong desire integrate multiple genomic data set cancer genome atlas characterize common also unique aspect cancer genetics cell biology source paper introduce angle-based joint individual variation explain capture joint individual variation within data block major improvement early approach challenge term new conceptual understanding much good adaption data heterogeneity fast linear algebra computation important mathematical contribution use score subspace principal descriptor variation structure use perturbation theory guide variation segmentation lead exploratory data analysis method insensitive heterogeneity among data block require separate normalization application cancer data reveals different behavior type signal characterize tumor subtypes application mortality data set reveals interesting historical lesson software data available github http github.com meileijiang ajive project
