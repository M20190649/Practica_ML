 learn task structure via sparsity group multitask learn sparse mapping key methodology many high-dimensional scientific problem multiple task share set relevant feature learn jointly group drastically improve quality relevant feature selection however practice technique use limitedly since group information usually hide paper goal recover group structure sparsity pattern leverage information sparse learning toward formulate joint optimization problem task parameter group membership construct appropriate regularizer encourage sparse learning well correct recovery task group demonstrate propose method recovers group sparsity pattern task parameter accurately extensive experiment
