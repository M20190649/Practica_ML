 recover block-structured activation use compressive measurement consider problem detection localization contiguous block weak activation large matrix small number noisy possibly adaptive compressive linear measurement closely relate problem compressed sensing task estimate sparse vector use small number linear measurement contrary result compressed sensing show neither adaptivity contiguous structure help much show reliable localization magnitude weak signal strongly influence structure ability choose measurement adaptively detection neither adaptivity structure reduce requirement magnitude signal characterize precise tradeoff various problem parameter signal strength number measurement require reliably detect localize block activation sufficient condition complement information theoretic low bound
