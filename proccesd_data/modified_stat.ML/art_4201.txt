 sample computation v storage tradeoff classification use tensor subspace model paper exhibit tradeoff training sample computation storage complexity problem supervised classification use signal subspace estimation main tool use tensor subspace i.e subspace kronecker structure embed data low dimension among subspace kronecker structure show use subspace hierarchical structure represent data lead improved tradeoff one main reason improvement embed data hierarchical kronecker structure subspace prevents overfitting high latent dimension
