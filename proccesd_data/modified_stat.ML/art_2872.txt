 formal hypothesis test additive structure random forest statistical learn method prove powerful tool predictive modeling black-box nature model produce severely limit interpretability ability conduct formal inference however natural structure ensemble learner like bag tree random forest show admit desirable asymptotic property base learner build proper subsamples work demonstrate define appropriate grid structure covariate space may carry formal hypothesis test variable importance underlying additive model structure knowledge test represent first statistical tool investigate underlying regression structure context random forest develop notion total partial additivity demonstrate test carry additional computational cost estimate variance within process construct ensemble furthermore propose novel extension test procedure utilize random projection order allow computationally efficient test procedure retain high power even grid size much large training set
