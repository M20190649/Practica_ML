 incommensurability phenomenon suppose two large multi-dimensional data set noisy measurement underlying random process principle component analysis perform separately data set reduce dimensionality circumstance may happen two lower-dimensional data set inordinately large procrustean fitting-error purpose manuscript quantify incommensurability phenomenon particular specify condition square procrustean fitting-error two normalized lower-dimensional data set asymptotically convex combination via correlation parameter hausdorff distance projection subspace maximum possible value square procrustean fitting-error normalized data show give rise incommensurability phenomenon employ illustrative simulation well real data experiment explore incommensurability phenomenon may appreciable impact
