 square root graphical model multivariate generalization univariate exponential family permit positive dependency develop square root graphical model sqr novel class parametric graphical model provide multivariate generalization univariate exponential family distribution previous multivariate graphical model yang et al allow positive dependency exponential poisson generalization however many real-world datasets variable clearly positive dependency example airport delay time new york -- -modeled exponential distribution -- -is positively relate delay time boston motivation give example model class derive univariate exponential distribution allow almost arbitrary positive negative dependency mild condition parameter matrix -- -a condition akin positive definiteness gaussian covariance matrix poisson generalization allow positive negative dependency without constraint parameter value also develop parameter estimation method use node-wise regression ell regularization likelihood approximation method use sampling finally demonstrate exponential generalization synthetic dataset real-world dataset airport delay time
