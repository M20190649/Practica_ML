 alternate minimization dictionary learning local convergence guarantee present theoretical guarantee alternating minimization algorithm dictionary learning sparse cod problem dictionary learning problem factorize vector sample ldots n appropriate basis dictionary sparse vector x ldots x n algorithm simple alternate minimization procedure switch ell minimization gradient descent alternate step dictionary learning specifically alternate minimization algorithm dictionary learning well study theoretically empirically however contrast previous theoretical analysis problem replace condition operator norm large magnitude singular value true underlying dictionary condition matrix infinity norm large magnitude term guarantee reasonable generative model allow dictionary grow operator norm handle arbitrary level overcompleteness sparsity information theoretically optimal also establish upper bound sample complexity algorithm
