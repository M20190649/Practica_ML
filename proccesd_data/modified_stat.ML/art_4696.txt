 learn sensor multiplexing design back-propagation recent progress many imaging vision task drive use deep feed-forward neural network train propagate gradient loss define final output back network first layer operate directly image propose back-propagating one step -- -to learn camera sensor design jointly network carry inference image capture paper specifically consider design inference problem typical color camera -- -where sensor able measure one color channel pixel location computational inference require reconstruct full color image learn camera sensor 's color multiplexing pattern encode layer whose learnable weight determine color channel among fixed set measure location weight jointly train reconstruction network operate corresponding sensor measurement produce full color image network achieve significant improvement accuracy traditional bayer pattern use color camera automatically learn employ sparse color measurement approach similar recent design moreover improve upon design learn optimal layout measurement
