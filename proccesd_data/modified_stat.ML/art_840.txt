 general multiblock method structure variable selection regularise canonical correlation analysis recently extend two set variable multiblock method regularise generalised canonical correlation analysis rgcca sparse gcca sgcca propose address issue variable selection however technical reason variable selection offer sgcca restrict covariance link block i.e. tau one main contribution paper go beyond covariance link propose extension sgcca full rgcca model i.e. tau addition propose extension sgcca exploit structural relationship variable within block specifically propose algorithm allow structure sparsity-inducing penalty include rgcca optimisation problem propose multiblock method illustrate real three-block high-grade glioma data set aim predict location brain tumour simulated data set aim illustrate method 's ability reconstruct true underlying weight vector
