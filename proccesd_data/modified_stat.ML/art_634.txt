 anomaly detection removal use non-stationary gaussian process paper propose novel gaussian process approach fault removal time-series data fault removal delete faulty signal data instead massage fault data assume one fault occur one time model signal two separate non-parametric gaussian process model physical phenomenon fault order facilitate fault removal introduce markov region link kernel handle non-stationary gaussian process kernel piece-wise stationary guarantee function generate derivative require everywhere continuous apply kernel removal drift bias error faulty sensor data also recovery eog artifact corrupt eeg signal
