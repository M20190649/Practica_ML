 compact nonlinear map circulant extension kernel approximation via nonlinear random feature map widely use speed kernel machine two main challenge conventional kernel approximation method first perform kernel approximation good kernel choose pick good kernel challenging problem second high-dimensional map often require order achieve good performance lead high computational cost generate nonlinear map subsequent learning prediction process work propose optimize nonlinear map directly respect classification objective data-dependent fashion propose approach achieve kernel approximation kernel learning joint framework lead much compact map without hurt performance by-product framework also use achieve compact kernel map approximate known kernel also introduce circulant nonlinear map use circulant-structured projection matrix speed nonlinear map high-dimensional data
