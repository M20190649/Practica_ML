 hodgerank information maximization crowdsourced pairwise rank aggregation recently crowdsourcing emerge effective paradigm human-powered large scale problem solve various domain however task requester usually limited amount budget thus desirable policy wisely allocate budget achieve good quality paper study principle information maximization active sampling strategy framework hodgerank approach base hodge decomposition pairwise rank data multiple worker principle exhibit two scenario active sampling fisher information maximization lead unsupervised sampling base sequential maximization graph algebraic connectivity without consider label bayesian information maximization select sample large information gain prior posterior give supervised sampling involve label collect experiment show propose method boost sample efficiency compare traditional sampling scheme thus valuable practical crowdsourcing experiment
