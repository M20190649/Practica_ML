 feature vector regularization machine learning problem machine learn ml involve noisy input data ml classification method reach limit accuracy base standard ml data set consist feature vector class great accuracy require incorporation prior structural information data learning study method regularize feature vector unsupervised regularization method analogous supervised regularization estimate function ml study regularization denoising ml feature vector use tikhonov regularization method function bf r n feature vector bf x x ldots x n x q q n view function index q smooth use prior information structure involve penalty functional feature vector analogous statistical learning use proximity e.g graph structure set index feature vector regularization inherit property function denoising bf r n accuracy non-monotonic denoising regularization parameter alpha assumption noise level data structure show best reconstruction accuracy also occur finite positive alpha index space graph structure adapt two standard function denoising method use bf r n local averaging kernel regression general index space discrete set notion proximity e.g metric space subset bf r n graph network feature vector function notion continuity show improve feature vector recovery thus subsequent classification regression do give example gene expression analysis cancer classification genome index space network structure base protein-protein interaction
