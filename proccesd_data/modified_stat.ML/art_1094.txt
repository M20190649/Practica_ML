 safe policy improvement minimize robust baseline regret important problem sequential decision-making uncertainty use limited data compute safe policy i.e. policy guarantee perform least well give baseline strategy paper develop analyze new model-based approach compute safe policy access inaccurate dynamic model system known accuracy guarantee propose robust method use inaccurate model directly minimize negative regret w.r.t baseline policy contrary exist approach minimize regret allow one improve baseline policy state accurate dynamic seamlessly fall back baseline policy otherwise show formulation np-hard propose approximate algorithm empirical result several domain show even relatively simple approximate algorithm significantly outperform standard approach
