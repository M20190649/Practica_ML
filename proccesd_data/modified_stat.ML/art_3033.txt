 propagation kernels introduce propagation kernel general graph-kernel framework efficiently measure similarity structure data propagation kernel base monitor information spread set give graph leverage early-stage distribution propagation scheme random walk capture structural information encode node label attribute edge information two benefit first off-the-shelf propagation scheme use naturally construct kernel many graph type include label partially label unlabeled direct attribute graph second leverage exist efficient informative propagation scheme propagation kernel considerably faster state-of-the-art approach without sacrifice predictive performance also show graph hand regular structure instance model image video data one exploit regularity scale kernel computation large database graph thousand node support contribution exhaustive experiment number real-world graph variety application domain
