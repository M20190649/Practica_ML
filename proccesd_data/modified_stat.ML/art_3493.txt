 type type ii bayesian method sparse signal recovery use scale mixture paper propose generalized scale mixture family distribution namely power exponential scale mixture pesm family model sparsity induce prior currently use sparse signal recovery ssr show successful popular method lasso reweighted ell reweighted ell method formulate unified manner maximum posteriori map type bayesian framework use appropriate member pesm family sparsity induce prior addition exploit natural hierarchical framework induce pesm family utilize prior type ii framework develop correspond em base estimation algorithm insight difference type type ii method provide particular interest algorithmic development type ii variant popular successful reweighted ell method extensive empirical result provide show type ii method exhibit good support recovery corresponding type method
