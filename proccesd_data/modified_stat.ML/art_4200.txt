 towards neural phrase-based machine translation paper present neural phrase-based machine translation npmt method explicitly model phrase structure output sequence use sleep-wake network swan recently propose segmentation-based sequence model method mitigate monotonic alignment requirement swan introduce new layer perform soft local reordering input sequence different exist neural machine translation nmt approach npmt use attention-based decoding mechanism instead directly output phrase sequential order decode linear time experiment show npmt achieves superior performance iwslt german-english english-german iwslt english-vietnamese machine translation task compare strong nmt baseline also observe method produce meaningful phrase output language
