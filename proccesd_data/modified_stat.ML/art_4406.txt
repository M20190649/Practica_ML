 adaptive cardinality estimation paper address cardinality estimation problem important subproblem query optimization query optimization part every relational dbms responsible find best way execution give query way call plan execution time different plan may differ several order query optimizer great influence whole dbms performance consider cost-based query optimization approach popular one observe cost-based optimization quality depend much cardinality estimation quality cardinality plan node number tuples return paper propose novel cardinality estimation approach use machine learn method main point approach use query execution statistic previously execute query improve cardinality estimation call approach adaptive cardinality estimation reflect point approach general flexible easy implement experimental evaluation show approach significantly increase quality cardinality estimation therefore increase dbms performance query several time even several dozen time
