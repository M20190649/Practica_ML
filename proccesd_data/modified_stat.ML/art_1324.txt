 refactor practical low-rank matrix estimation column-sparsity various problem data analysis statistical genetics call recovery column-sparse low-rank matrix noisy observation propose refactor simple variation classical truncate singular value decomposition tsvd algorithm contrast previous sparse principal component analysis pca algorithm algorithm provably reveal low-rank signal matrix well often significantly well widely use tsvd make algorithm choice whenever column-sparsity suspect empirically observe refactor consistently outperform tsvd even underlying signal sparse suggest generally safe use refactor instead tsvd pca algorithm extremely simple implement running time dominate runtime pca make practical standard principal component analysis
