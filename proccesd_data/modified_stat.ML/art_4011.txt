 class-prior estimation learn positive unlabeled data consider problem estimate class prior unlabeled dataset assumption additional labeled dataset available class prior estimate fit mixture class-wise data distribution unlabeled data distribution however practice additional labeled dataset often available paper show additional sample come positive class class prior unlabeled dataset estimate correctly key idea use properly penalize divergence model fitting cancel error cause absence negative sample show use penalized l -distance give computationally efficient algorithm analytic solution consistency stability estimation error theoretically analyze finally experimentally demonstrate usefulness propose method
