 mean-field network mean field algorithm widely use approximate inference algorithm graphical model whose exact inference intractable iteration mean field approximate marginals variable update get information neighbor process equivalently convert feedforward network layer represent one iteration mean field tied weight layer conversion enable natural extension e.g untie weight network paper study mean field network mfns use inference tool well discriminative model preliminary experiment result show mfns learn inference efficiently perform significantly good mean field discriminative model
