 causality longitudinal data stable specification search constrained structural equation model typical problem causal modeling instability model structure learning i.e. small change finite data result completely different optimal model present work introduce novel causal model algorithm longitudinal data robust finite sample base recent advance stability selection use subsampling selection algorithm approach use exploratory search allow incorporation prior knowledge e.g. absence particular causal relationship two specific variable represent causal relationship use structural equation model model score along two objective model fit model complexity since objective often conflict apply multi-objective evolutionary algorithm search pareto optimal model handle instability small finite data sample repeatedly subsample data select substructure optimal model stable parsimonious substructure visualize causal graph exploratory approach achieves least comparable performance often significant improvement state-of-the-art alternative approach simulated data set know ground truth also present result method three real-world longitudinal data set chronic fatigue syndrome alzheimer disease chronic kidney disease finding obtain approach generally line result hypothesis-driven analysis early study suggest novel relationship deserve research
