 beta process stick-breaking power law beta-bernoulli process provide bayesian nonparametric prior model involve collection binary-valued feature draw beta process yield infinite collection probability unit interval draw bernoulli process turn binary-valued feature recent work provide stick-breaking representation beta process analogous well-known stick-breaking representation dirichlet process derive one stick-breaking representation directly characterization beta process completely random measure approach motivate three-parameter generalization beta process study power law obtain generalized beta process present posterior inference algorithm beta-bernoulli process exploit stick-breaking representation present experimental result discrete factor-analysis model
