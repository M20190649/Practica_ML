 bayesian optimization synthetic gene design address problem synthetic gene design use bayesian optimization main issue design gene design space define term long string character different length render optimization intractable propose three-step approach deal issue first use gaussian process model emulate behavior cell input model use set biologically meaningful gene feature allow u define optimal gene design rule base model output define multi-task acquisition function optimize simultaneously severals aspect interest finally define evaluation function allow u rank set candidate gene sequence coherent optimal design strategy illustrate performance approach real gene design experiment mammalian cell
