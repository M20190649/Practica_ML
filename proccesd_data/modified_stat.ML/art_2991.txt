 marginal structure svm hidden variable work propose marginal structured svm mssvm structured prediction hidden variable mssvm properly account uncertainty hidden variable significantly outperform previously propose latent structure svm lssvm yu joachim state-of-art method especially uncertainty large method also result smoother objective function make gradient-based optimization mssvms converge significantly faster lssvms also show method consistently outperform hidden conditional random field hcrfs quattoni et al simulate real-world datasets furthermore propose unified framework include several exist method special case provide insight comparison different model practice
