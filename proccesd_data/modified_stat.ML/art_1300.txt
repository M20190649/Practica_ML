 convex couple matrix tensor completion propose set convex low rank inducing norm coupled matrix tensor hereafter couple tensor share information matrix tensor common mode specifically propose mixture overlapped trace norm latent norm matrix trace norm propose new completion algorithm base propose norm key advantage propose norm convex find globally optimal solution exist method couple learning non-convex furthermore analyze excess risk bound completion model regularize propose norm show propose norm exploit low rankness coupled tensor lead better bound compare uncoupled norm synthetic real-world data experiment show propose completion algorithm compare favorably exist completion algorithm
