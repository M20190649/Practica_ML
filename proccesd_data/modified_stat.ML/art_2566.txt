 model-based policy gradient parameter-based exploration least-squares conditional density estimation goal reinforcement learn rl let agent learn optimal control policy unknown environment future expect reward maximize model-free rl approach directly learn policy base data sample although use many sample tends improve accuracy policy learning collect large number sample often expensive practice hand model-based rl approach first estimate transition model environment learn policy base estimate transition model thus transition model accurately learn small amount data model-based approach perform good model-free approach paper propose novel model-based rl method combine recently propose model-free policy search method call policy gradient parameter-based exploration state-of-the-art transition model estimator call least-squares conditional density estimation experiment demonstrate practical usefulness propose method
