 graphprints towards graph analytic method network anomaly detection paper introduce novel graph-analytic approach detect anomaly network flow data call graphprints building foundational network-mining technique method represent time slice traffic graph count graphlets -- small induced subgraphs describe local topology perform outlier detection sequence graphlet count anomalous interval traffic identify furthermore individual ip experience abnormal behavior singled-out initial testing graphprints perform real network data implanted anomaly evaluation show false positive rate bound time-interval level ip-level true positive rate
