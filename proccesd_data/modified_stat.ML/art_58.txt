 kernel measure define gram matrix support present work new family kernel compare positive measure arbitrary space xcal endow positive kernel kappa translate naturally kernel histogram cloud point first cover case xcal euclidian focus kernel take account variance matrix mixture two measure compute similarity kernel define semigroup kernel sense use sum two measure compare spectral sense use eigenspectrum variance matrix mixture show family kernel close bond laplace transforms nonnegative-valued function define cone positive semidefinite matrix present close formula derive special case integral expression focus function invariant addition null eigenvalue spectrum variance matrix define kernel atomic measure arbitrary space xcal endow kernel kappa use directly eigenvalue centered gram matrix joined support compare measure provide explicit formula suit application present preliminary experiment illustrate interest approach
