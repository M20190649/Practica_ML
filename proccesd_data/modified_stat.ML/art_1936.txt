 learn network determine ratio prior data recent report describe equivalent sample size es dirichlet prior play important role learn bayesian network paper provide asymptotic analysis marginal likelihood score bayesian network result show ratio es sample size determine penalty add arc learn bayesian network number arcs increase monotonically es increase number arcs monotonically decrease es decrease furthermore marginal likelihood score provide unified expression various score metric change prior knowledge
