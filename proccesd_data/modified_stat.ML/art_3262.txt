 mathematical understanding detailed balance condition violation application langevin dynamic develop efficient sample method simulate langevin dynamic artificial force rather natural force use gradient potential energy standard technique sample follow predetermined distribution gibbs-boltzmann one perform detailed balance condition present study propose modified langevin dynamic violate detailed balance condition transition-probability formulation confirm numerical implementation propose method actually demonstrate two major beneficial improvement acceleration relaxation predetermine distribution reduction correlation time two different realization steady state
