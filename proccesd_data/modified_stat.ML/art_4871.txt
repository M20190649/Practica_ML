 learn unitary operator help u n major challenge training recurrent neural network so-called vanishing explode gradient problem use norm-preserving transition operator address issue parametrization challenge work focus unitary operator describe parametrization use lie algebra mathfrak u n associate lie group u n n time n unitary matrix exponential map provide correspondence space allow u define unitary matrix use n real coefficient relative basis lie algebra parametrization close additive update coefficient thus provide simple space gradient descent demonstrate effectiveness parametrization problem learn arbitrary unitary operator compare several baseline outperform recently-proposed lower-dimensional parametrization additionally use parametrization generalize recently-proposed unitary recurrent neural network arbitrary unitary matrix use solve standard long-memory task
