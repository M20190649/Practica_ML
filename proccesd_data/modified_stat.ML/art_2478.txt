 counterexample validity use nuclear norm convex surrogate rank rank minimization attract lot attention due robustness data recovery overcome computational difficulty rank often replace nuclear norm several rank minimization problem replacement theoretically prove valid i.e. solution nuclear norm minimization problem also solution rank minimization problem although easy believe replacement may always valid concrete example ever find argue validity checking do numerical computation show analyze noiseless latent low rank representation latlrr model even simple rank minimization problem validity may still break by-product find solution nuclear norm minimization formulation latlrr non-unique hence result latlrr report literature may questionable
