 provable benefit representation learning general consensus learn representation useful variety reason e.g efficient use label data semi-supervised learning transfer learning understanding hidden structure data popular technique representation learn include cluster manifold learning kernel-learning autoencoders boltzmann machine etc study relative merit technique 's essential formalize definition goal representation learning become instance definition paper introduce formal framework also formalize utility learn representation relate previous bayesian notion new twist show usefulness framework exhibit simple natural setting -- linear mixture model loglinear model power representation learning formally show example representation learning perform provably efficiently plausible assumption despite np-hard furthermore greatly reduce need label data semi-supervised learning ii allow solve classification task simpler approach like near neighbor require much data iii powerful manifold learning method
