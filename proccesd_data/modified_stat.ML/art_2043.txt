 convex feature learn formulation latent task structure discovery paper consider multi-task learning problem setting relevant feature could share across related task exist method assume extent give task relate share common feature space know apriori real-world application however desirable automatically discover group related task share feature space paper aim search exponentially large space possible group task may share feature space main contribution convex formulation employ graph-based regularizer simultaneously discovers group related task close-by task parameter well feature space share within group regularizer encode important structure among group task lead efficient algorithm solve feature space group task close-by task parameter exist feature space supersets efficient active set algorithm exploit simplification perform clever search exponentially large space present algorithm guarantee solve propose formulation within precision time polynomial number group related task discover empirical result benchmark datasets show propose formulation achieve good generalization outperform state-of-the-art multi-task learning algorithm case
