 factorize asymptotic bayesian hidden markov model paper address issue model selection hidden markov model hmms generalize factorized asymptotic bayesian inference fab recently develop model selection independent hidden variable i.e. mixture model time-dependent hidden variable fab mixture model fab hmms derive iterative low bound maximization algorithm factorized information criterion fic inherit fab mixture model several desirable property learn hmms asymptotic consistency fic marginal log-likelihood shrinkage effect hidden state selection monotonic increase low fic bound iterative optimization tunable hyper-parameter thus model selection process fully automate experimental result show fab outperforms states-of-the-art variational bayesian hmm non-parametric bayesian hmm term model selection accuracy computational efficiency
