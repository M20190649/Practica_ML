 two new approach compressed sensing exhibit robust sparse recovery group effect paper introduce new optimization formulation sparse regression compress sensing call clot combine l-one two wherein regularizer convex combination ell ell -norms formulation differs elastic net en formulation regularizer convex combination ell ell -norm square show context compressed sensing en formulation achieve robust recovery sparse vector whereas new clot formulation achieve robust recovery also like en unlike lasso clot formulation achieve grouping effect wherein coefficient highly correlate column measurement design matrix assign roughly comparable value already know lasso grouping effect therefore clot formulation combine best feature lasso robust sparse recovery en grouping effect clot formulation special case another one call sgl sparse group lasso introduce literature previously without analysis either grouping effect robust sparse recovery show sgl achieves robust sparse recovery also achieve version group effect coefficient highly correlate column belong group measurement design matrix assign roughly comparable value
