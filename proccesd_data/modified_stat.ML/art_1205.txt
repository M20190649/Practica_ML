 embarrassingly parallel inference gaussian process train gaussian process-based model typically involve n computational bottleneck due invert covariance matrix popular method overcome matrix inversion problem adequately model type latent function often parallelizable however judicious choice model structure ameliorate problem mixture-of-experts model use mixture k gaussian process offer model flexibility opportunity scalable inference embarrassingly parallel algorithm combine low-dimensional matrix inversion importance sample yield flexible scalable mixture-of-experts model offer comparable performance gaussian process regression much low computational cost
