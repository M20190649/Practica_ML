 hidden convexity spectral clustering recent year spectral clustering become standard method data analysis use broad range application paper propose new class algorithm multiway spectral cluster base optimization certain contrast function unit sphere algorithm partly inspire certain independent component analysis technique simple easy implement efficient geometrically propose algorithm interpret hidden basis recovery mean function optimization give complete characterization contrast function admissible provable basis recovery show condition interpret hidden convexity optimization problem sphere interestingly use efficient convex maximization rather common convex minimization also show encouraging experimental result real simulate data
