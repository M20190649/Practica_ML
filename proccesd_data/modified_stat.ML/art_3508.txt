 tumor motion track liver ultrasound image use mean shift active contour paper present new method motion tracking tumor liver ultrasound image sequence algorithm two main step first step apply mean shift algorithm multiple feature estimate center target frame target first frame define use ellipse edge texture intensity feature extract first frame mean shift algorithm apply feature separately find center ellipse relate feature next frame center ellipse weighted average center use mean shift actually estimate target movement two consecutive frame correct ellipsoid frame know second step apply dynamic directional gradient vector flow ddgvf version active contour model order find correct boundary tumor sample point boundary active contour translate point base translation center ellipsoid two consecutive frame determine target movement use translated sample point initial guess active contour next frame experimental result show suggested method provide reliable performance liver tumor track ultrasound image sequence
