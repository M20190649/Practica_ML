 dependency detection similarity constraint unsupervised two-view learning detection dependency two pair data set typically do variant canonical correlation analysis cca cca search linear projection view correlation projection maximize solution invariant linear transformation either view task small sample size flexibility implies overfitting even bad flexible nonparametric kernel-based dependency discovery method develop variant reduce degree freedom assume constraint similarity projection two view particular example provide cancer gene discovery application chromosomal distance affect dependency gene copy number activity level similarity constraint show improve detection performance known cancer gene
