 precondition data sparsification big data application pca k-means analyze compression scheme large data set randomly keep small percentage component data sample benefit output sparse matrix therefore subsequent processing pca k-means significantly faster especially distributed-data setting furthermore sampling single-pass applicable stream data sampling mechanism variant previous method propose literature combine randomized preconditioning smooth data provide guarantee pca term covariance matrix guarantee k-means term error center estimator give step present numerical evidence show bound nearly tight algorithm provide real benefit apply standard test data set well provide certain benefit related sampling approach
