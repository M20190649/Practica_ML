 saturate spline feature selection extend adaptive regression spline model incorporate saturation natural requirement function extend constant outside certain range fit saturate spline data use convex optimization problem space measure solve use efficient algorithm base conditional gradient method unlike many exist approach algorithm solve original infinite-dimensional spline degree least two optimization problem without pre-specified knot location adapt algorithm fit generalized additive model saturate spline coordinate function show saturation requirement allow model simultaneously perform feature selection nonlinear function fitting finally briefly sketch method extend high order spline different requirement extension outside data range
