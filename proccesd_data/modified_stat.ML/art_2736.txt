 learn without concentration obtain sharp bound performance empirical risk minimization perform convex class respect squared loss without assume class member target bound function rapidly decay tail rather resort concentration-based argument method use rely small-ball assumption thus hold class consist heavy-tailed function heavy-tailed target result estimate scale correctly noise level problem apply classical bound scenario always improve known bound
