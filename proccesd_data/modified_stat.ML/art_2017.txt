 greedy block coordinate descent large scale gaussian process regression propose variable decomposition algorithm -greedy block coordinate descent gbcd order make dense gaussian process regression practical large scale problem gbcd break large scale optimization series small sub-problems challenge variable decomposition algorithm identification subproblem active set variable yield large improvement analyze limitation exist method cast active set selection zero-norm constrain optimization problem solve use greedy method directly estimate decrease objective function obtain efficient approximate solution gbcd also able demonstrate method globally convergent empirical comparison compete dense method like conjugate gradient smo show gbcd order magnitude faster comparison sparse gp method show gbcd accurate capable handle datasets sample
