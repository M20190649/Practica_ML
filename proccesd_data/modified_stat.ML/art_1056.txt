 well conditional density estimation neural network vast majority neural network literature focus predict point value give set response variable condition feature vector many case need model full joint conditional distribution response variables rather simply make point prediction paper present two novel approach conditional density estimation cde multiscale net msns cde trend filtering multiscale net transform cde regression task hierarchical classification task decompose density series half-spaces learn boolean probability split cde trend filter applies k-th order graph trend filter penalty unnormalized logits multinomial classifier network edge graph correspond neighboring point discretized version density compare method plain multinomial classifier network mixture density network mdns simulated dataset three real-world datasets result suggest two method complementary msns work well high-data-per-feature regime cde-tf well suit few-samples-per-feature scenario overfitting primary concern
