 nonconvex penalization sparse estimation approach base bernstein function paper study nonconvex penalization use bernstein function whose first-order derivative completely monotone bernstein function induce class nonconvex penalty function high-dimensional sparse estimation problem derive thresholding function base bernstein penalty discuss important mathematical property sparsity modeling show coordinate descent algorithm especially appropriate regression problem penalize bernstein function also consider application bernstein penalty classification problem devise proximal alternate linearized minimization method base theory kurdyka-lojasiewicz inequality conduct convergence analysis alternate iteration procedure particularly exemplify family bernstein nonconvex penalty base generalize gamma measure conduct empirical analysis family
