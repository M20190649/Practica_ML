 cur algorithm incomplete matrix observation cur matrix decomposition randomized algorithm efficiently compute low rank approximation give rectangle matrix one limitation exist cur algorithm require access full matrix compute u. work aim alleviate limitation particular assume besides access randomly sample row column observe subset randomly sample entry a. goal develop low rank approximation algorithm similar cur base randomly sample row column ii randomly sample entry a. propose algorithm able perfectly recover target matrix rn log n number observed entry addition instead solve optimization problem involve trace norm regularization propose algorithm need solve standard regression problem finally unlike matrix completion theory hold target matrix low rank show strong guarantee propose algorithm even target matrix low rank
