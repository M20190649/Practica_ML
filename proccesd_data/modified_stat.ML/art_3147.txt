 distribute decision tree recently propose budding tree decision tree algorithm every node part internal node part leaf allow represent every decision tree continuous parameter space therefore budding tree jointly train backpropagation like neural network even though continuity allow use hierarchical representation learning learned representation local activation make soft selection among root-to-leaf path tree work extend budding tree propose distributed tree child use different independent split hence multiple path tree traverse time ability combine multiple path give power distributed representation traditional perceptron layer show distribute tree perform comparably good budding traditional hard tree classification regression task
