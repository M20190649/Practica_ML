 distribute algorithm learn cognitive medium access logarithmic regret problem distribute learning channel access consider cognitive network multiple secondary user availability statistic channel initially unknown secondary user estimate use sense decision explicit information exchange prior agreement among secondary user propose policy distributed learning access achieve order-optimal cognitive system throughput number successful secondary transmission self play i.e. implement secondary user equivalently policy minimize regret distributed learning access first consider scenario number secondary user know policy prove total regret logarithmic number transmission slot distribute learning access policy achieve order-optimal regret compare asymptotic low bound regret uniformly-good learning access policy consider case number secondary user fix unknown estimate feedback propose policy scenario whose asymptotic sum regret grow slightly faster logarithmic number transmission slot
