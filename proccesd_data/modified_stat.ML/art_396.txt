 reversible infinite hmm use normalised random measure present nonparametric prior reversible markov chain use completely random measure specifically gamma process construct countably infinite graph weighted edge enforce symmetry make edge undirected define prior random walk graph result reversible markov chain result prior infinite transition matrix closely relate hierarchical dirichlet process enforce reversibility reinforcement scheme recently propose similar property de finetti measure well characterise take alternative approach explicitly construct mixing measure allow straightforward efficient inference cost longer closed form predictive distribution use process construct reversible infinite hmm apply two real datasets one epigenomics one ion channel recording
