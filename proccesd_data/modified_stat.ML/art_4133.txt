 inconsistent node flatten improve top-down hierarchical classification large-scale classification data class structurally organize hierarchy important area research top-down approach exploit hierarchy learning prediction phase efficient large scale hierarchical classification however accuracy top-down approach poor due error propagation i.e. prediction error make high level hierarchy correct low level one main reason behind error high level presence inconsistent node introduce due arbitrary process create hierarchy domain expert paper propose two different data-driven approach local global hierarchical structure modification identifies flattens inconsistent node present within hierarchy extensive empirical evaluation propose approach several image text datasets vary distribution feature class training instance per class show improve classification performance compete hierarchical modification approach specifically see improvement upto macro-f score approach best td baseline source code http www.cs.gmu.edu mlbio inconsistentnodeflattening
