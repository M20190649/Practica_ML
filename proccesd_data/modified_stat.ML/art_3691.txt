 optimal whitening decorrelation whitening sphering common preprocessing step statistical analysis transform random variable orthogonality however due rotational freedom infinitely many possible whitening procedure consequently diverse range sphering method use example base principal component analysis pca cholesky matrix decomposition zero-phase component analysis zca among others provide overview underlie theory discuss five natural whitening procedure subsequently demonstrate investigate cross-covariance cross-correlation matrix sphered original variable allow break rotational invariance identify optimal whiten transformation result recommend two particular approach zca-cor whitening produce sphered variable maximally similar original variable pca-cor whitening obtain sphered variable maximally compress original variable
