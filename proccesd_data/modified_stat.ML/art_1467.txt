 distance-based classifier data transformation high-dimension strongly spike eigenvalue model consider classifier high-dimensional data strongly spike eigenvalue sse model first show high-dimensional data often sse model consider distance-based classifier use eigenstructures sse model apply noise reduction methodology estimation eigenvalue eigenvectors sse model create new distance-based classifier transform data sse model non-sse model give simulation study discuss performance new classifier finally demonstrate new classifier use microarray data set
