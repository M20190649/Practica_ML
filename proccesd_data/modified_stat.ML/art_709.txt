 k -means fighting degeneracy sequential monte carlo application track regular particle filter algorithm sequential monte carlo smc method initial weight traditionally dependent propose distribution posterior distribution current timestamp sampled sequence target posterior distribution previous timestamp technically correct lead algorithms usually practical issue degeneracy particle eventually collapse onto single particle paper propose evaluate use k mean cluster attack even take advantage degeneracy specifically propose stochastic smc algorithm initialize set k mean provide initial center choose collapsed particle fight degeneracy adjust regular smc weight mediate cluster proportion correct retain expectation experimentally demonstrate approach good performance vanilla algorithm
