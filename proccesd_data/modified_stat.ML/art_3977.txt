 learn bound parameter transfer learning consider transfer-learning problem use parameter transfer approach suitable parameter feature mapping learn one task apply another objective task introduce notion local stability parameter transfer learnability parametric feature mapping thereby derive learning bound parameter transfer algorithm application parameter transfer learning discuss performance sparse coding self-taught learning although self-taught learn algorithm plentiful unlabeled data often show excellent empirical performance theoretical analysis study paper also provide first theoretical learning bound self-taught learning
