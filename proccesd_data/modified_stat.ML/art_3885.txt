 cost-sensitive label embed multi-label classification label embed le important family multi-label classification algorithm digest label information jointly good performance different real-world application evaluate performance different cost function interest current le algorithm often aim optimize one specific cost function suffer bad performance respect cost function paper resolve performance issue propose novel cost-sensitive le algorithm take cost function interest account propose algorithm cost-sensitive label embed multidimensional scaling clems approximate cost information distance embedded vector use classic multidimensional scaling approach manifold learning clems able deal symmetric asymmetric cost function effectively make cost-sensitive decision nearest-neighbor decoding within embedded vector derive theoretical result justify clems achieve desired cost-sensitivity furthermore extensive experimental result demonstrate clems significantly good wide spectrum exist le algorithm state-of-the-art cost-sensitive algorithm across different cost function
