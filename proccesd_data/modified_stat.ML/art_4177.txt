 optimistic versus randomize exploration reinforcement learning discuss relative merit optimistic randomized approach exploration reinforcement learning optimistic approach present literature apply optimistic boost value estimate state-action pair select action greedy respect result optimistic value function randomize approach sample among statistically plausible value function select action greedy respect random sample prior computational experience suggest randomized approach lead far statistically efficient learning present two simple analytic example elucidate case principle optimistic approach fare well relative randomize approach would require intractable computation optimistic approach propose literature sacrifice statistical efficiency sake computational efficiency randomize approach hand may enable simultaneous statistical computational efficiency
