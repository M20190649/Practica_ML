 trust-region method stochastic variational inference application stream data stochastic variational inference allow fast posterior inference complex bayesian model however algorithm prone local optimum make quality posterior approximation sensitive choice hyperparameters initialization address problem replace natural gradient step stochastic varitional inference trust-region update show lead generally good result reduced sensitivity hyperparameters also describe new strategy variational inference stream data show trust-region method crucial get good performance
