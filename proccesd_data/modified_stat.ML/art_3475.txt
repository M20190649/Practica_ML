 intrinsic non-stationary covariance function climate modeling design covariance function represent underlying correlation crucial step model complex natural system climate model geospatial datasets global scale usually suffer non-stationarity non-uniformly smooth spatial boundary gaussian process regression use non-stationary covariance function show promise task covariance function adapts variable correlation structure underlying distribution paper generalize non-stationary covariance function address aforementioned global scale geospatial issue define generalized covariance function intrinsic non-stationary covariance function use intrinsic statistic symmetric positive definite matrix represent characteristic length scale thereby model local stochastic process experiment synthetic real dataset relative sea level change across world demonstrate improvement error metric regression estimate use newly propose approach
