 constrained matrix-variate gaussian process transposable data transposable data represent interaction among two set entity typically represent matrix contain know interaction value additional side information may consist feature vector specific entity correspond row column matrix information may also available form interaction hierarchy among entity along mode axis propose novel approach model transposable data miss interaction give additional side information interaction model noisy observation latent noise free matrix generate matrix-variate gaussian process construction row column covariance use side information provide flexible mechanism specify a-priori knowledge row column correlation data use prior combine side information enable prediction new row columns observe training data work combine matrix-variate gaussian process model low rank constraint constrained gaussian process approach apply prediction hidden association gene disease use small set observed association well prior covariance induce gene-gene interaction network disease ontology propose approach also apply recommender system data involve predict item rating user use known association well prior covariance induce social network present experimental result highlight performance constrain matrix-variate gaussian process compare state art approach domain
