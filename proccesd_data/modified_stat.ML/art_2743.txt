 accelerate abc method use gaussian process approximate bayesian computation abc method use approximate posterior distribution use simulation rather likelihood calculation introduce gaussian process gp accelerate abc show significantly reduce number simulation require computational resource usually main determinant accuracy abc gp-accelerated method thus enable accurate inference model gp model unknown log-likelihood function use exploit continuity smoothness reduce required computation use sequence model increase accuracy use intermediate model rule region parameter space implausible method suitable problem use result significant computational saving ricker model able achieve accurate approximation posterior distribution use factor few simulator evaluation comparable monte carlo approach population genetics model able approximate exact posterior first time
