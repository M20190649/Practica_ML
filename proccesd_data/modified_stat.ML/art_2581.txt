 sharp threshold multivariate multi-response linear regression via block regularize lasso paper investigate multivariate multi-response mvmr linear regression problem contain multiple linear regression model differently distribute design matrix different regression output vector goal recover support union regression vector use l l -regularized lasso characterize sufficient necessary condition sample complexity emph sharp threshold guarantee successful recovery support union namely sample size threshold l l -regularized lasso correctly recover support union sample size threshold l l -regularized lasso fail recover support union particular threshold precisely capture impact sparsity regression vector statistical property design matrix sample complexity therefore threshold function also capture advantage joint support union recovery use multi-task lasso individual support recovery use single-task lasso
