 semi-supervised learn deep generative model ever-increasing size modern data set combine difficulty obtain label information make semi-supervised learn one problem significant practical importance modern data analysis revisit approach semi-supervised learning generative model develop new model allow effective generalisation small label data set large unlabelled one generative approach thus far either inflexible inefficient non-scalable show deep generative model approximate bayesian inference exploit recent advance variational method use provide significant improvement make generative approach highly competitive semi-supervised learning
