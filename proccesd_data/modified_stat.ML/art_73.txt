 hyper-sparse optimal aggregation paper consider problem hyper-sparse aggregation namely give dictionary f f ... f function look optimal aggregation algorithm write tilde f sum j theta j f j many zero coefficient theta j possible problem particular interest f contain many irrelevant function appear tilde f provide exact oracle inequality tilde f two coefficient non-zero entail tilde f optimal aggregation algorithm since selector suboptimal aggregation procedure prove minimal number element f require construction optimal aggregation procedure every situation simulated example algorithm propose dictionary obtain use lars problem selection regularization parameter lasso also give example use aggregation achieve minimax adaptation anisotropic besov space previously know minimax theory regression random design
