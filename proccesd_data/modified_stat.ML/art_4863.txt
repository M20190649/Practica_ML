 incomplete pivot qr-based dimensionality reduction high-dimensional big data appear many research field image recognition biology collaborative filtering often exploration data classic algorithm encounter difficulty due curse dimensionality phenomenon therefore dimensionality reduction method apply data prior analysis many method base principal component analysis statistically drive namely map data low-dimension subspace preserve significant statistical property high-dimensional data consequence method directly address geometry data reflect mutual distance multidimensional data point thus operation classification anomaly detection machine learn task may affect work provide dictionary-based framework geometrically drive data analysis include dimensionality reduction out-of-sample extension anomaly detection embed high-dimensional data low-dimensional subspace embed preserve original high-dimensional geometry data user-defined distortion rate addition identify subset landmark data point constitute dictionary analyzed dataset dictionary enables natural extension low-dimensional embedding out-of-sample data point give rise distortion-based criterion anomaly detection suggested method demonstrate synthetic real-world datasets achieves good result classification anomaly detection out-of-sample task
