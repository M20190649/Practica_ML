 combine observational experimental data find heterogeneous treatment effect every design choice different effect different unit however traditional b test often underpowered identify heterogeneous effect especially true set unit-level attribute high-dimensional prior weak particular covariates important however often observational data set available order magnitude large propose method combine two data source estimate heterogeneous treatment effect first use observational time series data estimate mapping covariates unit-level effect estimate likely bias condition bias preserve unit-level relative rank ordering condition hold need sufficient experimental data identify monotonic one-dimensional transformation observationally predict treatment effect real treatment effect reduce power demand greatly make detection heterogeneous effect much easy application show method use improve facebook page recommendation
