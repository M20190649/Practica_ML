 regret online combinatorial optimization address online linear optimization problem possible action decision maker represent binary vector regret decision maker difference realize loss best loss would achieve pick hindsight best possible action goal understand magnitude best possible minimax regret study problem three different assumption feedback decision maker receive full information partial information model so-called semi-bandit bandit problem combine mirror descent algorithm inf implicitely normalized forecaster strategy able prove optimal bound semi-bandit case also recover optimal bound full information setting bandit case discuss exist result light new low bound suggest conjecture optimal regret case finally also prove standard exponentially weighted average forecaster provably suboptimal setting online combinatorial optimization
