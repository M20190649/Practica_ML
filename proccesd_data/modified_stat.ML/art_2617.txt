 unsupervised learning noisy-or bayesian network paper consider problem learn parameter bayesian network discrete variable known structure hidden variable previous approach setting typically use expectation maximization network high treewidth required expectation might approximate use monte carlo variational method show avoid inference altogether learn give polynomial-time algorithm base method-of-moments building upon recent work learn discrete-valued mixture model particular show learn parameter family bipartite noisy-or bayesian network experimental result demonstrate application algorithm learn qmr-dt large bayesian network use medical diagnosis show possible fully learn parameter qmr-dt even finding observe training data ground truth diseases unknown
