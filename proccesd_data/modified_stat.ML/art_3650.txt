 local entropy measure sample solution constraint satisfaction problem introduce novel entropy-driven monte carlo edmc strategy efficiently sample solution random constraint satisfaction problem csps first extend recent result use large-deviation analysis show geometry space solution binary perceptron learning problem prototypical csp contain region high-density solution despite sub-dominant region find optimize local entropy measure building result construct fast solver rely exclusively local entropy estimate apply general csps describe performance perceptron learning problem also random k -satisfiabilty problem another prototypical csp radically different structure show numerically simple zero-temperature metropolis search smooth local entropy landscape reach sub-dominant cluster optimal solution small number step standard simulate anneal either require extremely long cooling procedure fails also discuss edmc heuristically make even efficient case study
