 predictive state recurrent neural network present new model predictive state recurrent neural network psrnns filter prediction dynamical system psrnns draw insight recurrent neural network rnns predictive state representation psrs inherit advantage type model like many successful rnn architecture psrnns use potentially deeply composed bilinear transfer function combine information multiple source show bilinear function arise naturally state update bayes filter like psrs observation view gate belief state also show psrnns learn effectively combine backpropogation time bptt initialization derive statistically consistent learn algorithm psrs call two-stage regression sr finally show psrnns factorize use tensor decomposition reduce model size suggest interesting connection exist multiplicative architecture lstms apply psrnns datasets show outperform several popular alternative approach model dynamical system case
