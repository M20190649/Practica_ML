 robust semi-supervised least square classification implicit constraint introduce implicitly constrain least square icls classifier novel semi-supervised version least square classifier classifier minimize squared loss label data among set parameter imply possible labelings unlabeled data unlike discriminative semi-supervised method approach introduce explicit additional assumption objective function leverage implicit assumption already present choice supervise least square classifier method formulate quadratic programming problem solution find use simple gradient descent procedure prove limited -dimensional setting approach never lead performance bad supervise classifier experimental result show also general multidimensional case performance improvement expect term squared loss intrinsic classifier well term expected classification error
