 gate end-to-end memory network machine read use differentiable reasoning model recently show remarkable progress context end-to-end trainable memory network memn n demonstrate promising performance simple natural language base reason task factual reasoning basic deduction however task namely multi-fact question-answering positional reasoning dialog related task remain challenging particularly due necessity complex interaction memory controller module compose family model paper introduce novel end-to-end memory access regulation mechanism inspire current progress connection short-cutting principle field computer vision concretely develop gated end-to-end trainable memory network architecture gmemn n. machine learn perspective new capability learn end-to-end fashion without use additional supervision signal far knowledge go first kind experiment show significant improvement challenging task babi dataset without use domain knowledge show improvement dialog babi task include real human-bot conversion-based dialog state track challenge dstc- dataset two datasets model set new state art
