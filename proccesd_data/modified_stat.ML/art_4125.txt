 unifying deep generative model deep generative model achieve impressive success recent year generative adversarial network gans variational autoencoders vaes emerge family generative model learning largely consider two distinct paradigm receive extensive independent study respectively paper aim establish formal connection gans vaes new formulation interpret sample generation gans perform posterior inference show gans vaes involve minimize kl divergence respective posterior inference distribution opposite direction extend two learning phase classic wake-sleep algorithm respectively unified view provide powerful tool analyze diverse set exist model variant enable transfer technique across research line principled way example apply importance weight method vae literature improved gan learning enhance vaes adversarial mechanism leverage generate sample experiment show generality effectiveness transferred technique
