 deep direct generative model energy-based probability estimation train energy-based probabilistic model confront apparently intractable sum whose monte carlo estimation require sample estimate probability distribution inner loop training approximately achieve markov chain monte carlo method may still face formidable obstacle difficulty mix mode sharp concentration probability whereas mcmc process usually derive give energy function base mathematical consideration require arbitrarily long time obtain good varied sample propose train deep directed generative model markov chain sample distribution approximately match energy function train inspire generative adversarial network propose framework involve train two model represent dual view estimate probability distribution energy function map input configuration scalar energy value generator map noise vector generate configuration represent deep neural network
