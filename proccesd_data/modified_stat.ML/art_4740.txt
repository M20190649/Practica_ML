 graph-based semi-supervised k nearest-neighbor method nonlinear manifold distribute data classification k near neighbor k nn one widely use supervise learn algorithm classify gaussian distribute data achieve good result apply nonlinear manifold distribute data especially limited amount label sample available paper propose new graph-based k nn algorithm effectively handle gaussian distribute data nonlinear manifold distribute data achieve goal first propose constrain tired random walk trw construct r -level nearest-neighbor strengthen tree graph compute trw matrix similarity measurement purpose near neighbor identify accord trw matrix class label query point determine sum trw weight near neighbor deal online situation also propose new algorithm handle sequential sample base local neighborhood reconstruction comparison experiment conduct synthetic data set real-world data set demonstrate validity propose new k nn algorithm improvement version k nn algorithm give widespread appearance manifold structure real-world problem popularity traditional k nn algorithm propose manifold version k nn show promise potential classify manifold-distributed data
