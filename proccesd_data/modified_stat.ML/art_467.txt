 linear state-space model time-varying dynamic paper introduce linear state-space model time-varying dynamic time dependency obtain form state dynamic matrix time-varying linear combination set matrix time dependency weight linear combination model another linear gaussian dynamical model allow model learn dynamic process change previous approach use switching model small set possible state dynamic matrix model select one matrix time thus jump model form dynamic linear combination change smooth continuous model motivate physical process describe linear partial differential equation whose parameter vary time example process could temperature field whose evolution drive varying wind direction posterior inference perform use variational bayesian approximation experiment stochastic advection-diffusion process real-world weather process show model time-varying dynamic outperform previously introduce approach
