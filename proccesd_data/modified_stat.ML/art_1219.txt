 polynomial time algorithm dual volume sample study dual volume sampling method select k column n x short wide matrix n k probability selection proportional volume span row induced submatrix method propose avron boutsidis show promising method column subset selection multiple application however wider adoption hamper lack polynomial time sample algorithm remove hindrance develop exact randomize polynomial time sample algorithm well derandomization thereafter study dual volume sample via theory real stable polynomial prove distribution satisfy strong rayleigh property result numerous consequence include provably fast-mixing markov chain sampler make dual volume sample much attractive practitioner sampler closely relate classical algorithm popular experimental design method date lack theoretical analysis know empirically work well
