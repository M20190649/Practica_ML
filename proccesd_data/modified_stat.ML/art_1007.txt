 structure matrix recovery via generalized dantzig selector recent year structure matrix recovery problem gain considerable attention real world application recommender system computer vision much exist work focus matrix low-rank structure limited progress make matrix type structure paper present non-asymptotic analysis estimation generally structure matrix via generalized dantzig selector generic sub-gaussian measurement show estimation error always succinctly express term geometric measure suitable set depend structure underlie true matrix addition derive general bound geometric measure structure characterize unitarily invariant norm large family cover matrix norm practical interest example provide illustrate utility theoretical development
