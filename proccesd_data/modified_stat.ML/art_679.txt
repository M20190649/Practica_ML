 asymptotically optimal sequential experimentation generalized ranking consider mnk classical problem controller activating sample sequentially finite number n geq population specify unknown distribution time horizon time n ldots controller wish select population sample goal sample population optimize score function distribution e.g. maximize expect sum outcome minimize variability define class textit uniformly fast uf sample policy show mild regularity condition asymptotic low bound expected total number sub-optimal population activation provide sufficient condition ucb policy uf asymptotically optimal since attain low bound explicit solution provide number example interest include general score functionals unconstrained pareto distribution potentially infinite mean uniform distribution unknown support additional result bandit normal distribution also provide
