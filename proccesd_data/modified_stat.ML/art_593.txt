 vector-space markov random field via exponential family present vector-space markov random field vs-mrfs novel class undirected graphical model variable belong arbitrary vector space vs-mrfs generalize recent line work scalar-valued uni-parameter exponential family mixed graphical model thereby greatly broaden class exponential family available e.g. allow multinomial dirichlet distribution specifically vs-mrfs joint graphical model distribution node-conditional distribution belong generic exponential family general vector space domain also present sparsistent -estimator learn class mrfs recover correct set edge high probability validate approach via set synthetic data experiment well real-world case study four million food popular diet track app myfitnesspal result demonstrate algorithm performs well empirically vs-mrfs capable capture highlight interesting structure complex real-world data code algorithm open source publicly available
