 concrete dropout dropout use practical tool obtain uncertainty estimate large vision model reinforcement learn rl task obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimate grid-search dropout probability necessary prohibitive operation large model impossible one rl propose new dropout variant give improved performance well calibrate uncertainty rely recent development bayesian deep learning use continuous relaxation dropout 's discrete mask together principled optimisation objective allow automatic tuning dropout probability large model result faster experimentation cycle rl allow agent adapt uncertainty dynamically data observe analyse propose variant extensively range task give insight common practice field large dropout probability often use deep model layer
