 group factor analysis factor analysis provide linear factor describe relationship individual variable data set extend classical formulation linear factor describe relationship group variable group represent either set related variable data set model also naturally extend canonical correlation analysis two set way flexible previous extension solution formulate variational inference latent variable model structural sparsity consist two hierarchical level high level model relationship group whereas low model observed variable give high level show result solution solve group factor analysis problem accurately outperform alternative factor analysis base solution well straightforward implementation group factor analysis method demonstrate two life science data set one brain activation system biology illustrate applicability analysis different type high-dimensional data source
