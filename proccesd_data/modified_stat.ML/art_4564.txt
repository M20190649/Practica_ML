 optimally prune decision tree ensemble feature cost consider problem learn decision rule prediction feature budget constraint particular interested prune ensemble decision tree reduce expect feature cost maintain high prediction accuracy test example propose novel integer program formulation ensemble pruning prune formulation general take ensemble decision tree input explicitly account feature-sharing across tree together accuracy cost trade-off method able significantly reduce feature cost prune subtrees introduce loss term feature cost benefit term prediction accuracy gain theoretically prove linear programming relaxation produce exact solution original integer program allow u use efficient convex optimization tool obtain optimally prune ensemble give budget empirically see prune algorithm significantly improve performance state art ensemble method budgetrf
