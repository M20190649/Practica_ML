 structure learning probabilistic graphical model comprehensive survey probabilistic graphical model combine graph theory probability theory give multivariate statistical modeling provide unified description uncertainty use probability complexity use graphical model especially graphical model provide following several useful property graphical model provide simple intuitive interpretation structure probabilistic model hand use design motivate new model graphical model provide additional insight property model include conditional independence property complex computation require perform inference learning sophisticated model express term graphical manipulation underlie mathematical expression carry along implicitly graphical model apply large number field include bioinformatics social science control theory image processing marketing analysis among others however structure learn graphical model remain open challenge since one must cope combinatorial search space possible structure paper present comprehensive survey exist structure learn algorithm
