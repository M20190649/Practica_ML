 general hybrid clustering technique propose clustering technique general clustering problem include non-convex cluster give desired number cluster k use three stage find clustering first stage use hybrid clustering technique produce series clustering various size randomly select key step find k -means cluster use k ell cluster k ell gg k join small cluster use single linkage clustering second stage stabilize result stage one reclustering via membership matrix ham distance generate dendrogram third stage cut dendrogram get k cluster k geq k prune back k give final clustering variant technique also give reasonable estimate k true number cluster provide series argument justify step stage method provide numerous example involve real simulate data compare technique related technique
