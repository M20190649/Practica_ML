 robust pca high-dimension deterministic approach consider principal component analysis contaminate data-set high dimensional regime dimensionality observation comparable even number observation propose deterministic high-dimensional robust pca algorithm inherit theoretical property randomized counterpart i.e. tractable robust contaminated point easily kernelizable asymptotic consistent achieve maximal robustness -- breakdown point importantly propose method exhibit significantly well computational efficiency make suitable large-scale real application
