 deal range anxiety mean estimation via statistical query give algorithm estimate expectation give real-valued function phi x bf r sample drawn randomly unknown distribution domain x namely bf e bf x sim phi bf x algorithms work two well-studied model restricted access data sample first one statistical query sq model algorithm access sq oracle input distribution x instead i.i.d sample give query function phi x oracle return estimate bf e bf x sim phi bf x within tolerance tau second model single bit communicate sample model error obtain use naive implementation would scale polynomially range random variable phi bf x might even infinite contrast without restriction access data expected error scale standard deviation phi bf x give simple algorithm whose error scale linearly standard deviation phi bf x logarithmically upper bound second moment phi bf x corollary obtain algorithm high dimensional mean estimation stochastic convex optimization model work general setting previously know solution
