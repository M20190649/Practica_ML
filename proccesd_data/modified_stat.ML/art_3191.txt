 factorization inference parameter learning discrete amp chain graph address computational issue may hinder use amp chain graph practice specifically show discrete probability distribution satisfy independency represent amp chain graph factorize accord show factorization make possible perform inference parameter learn efficiently adapt exist algorithm markov bayesian network finally turn attention another issue may hinder use amp cgs namely lack intuitive interpretation edge provide one interpretation
