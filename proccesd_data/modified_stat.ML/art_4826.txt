 clustering-based relational unsupervised representation learn explicit distribute representation goal unsupervised representation learning extract new representation data solve many different task becomes easy exist method typically focus vectorized data offer little support relational data additionally describe relationship among instance work introduce approach relational unsupervised representation learning view relational dataset hypergraph new feature obtain cluster vertex hyperedges find representation suit many relational learning task wide range similarity relational object consider e.g feature structural similarity experimentally evaluate propose approach show model learn latent representation perform good low complexity outperform exist approach classification task
