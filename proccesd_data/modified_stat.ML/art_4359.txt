 beyond sparsity tree regularization deep model interpretability lack interpretability remain key barrier adoption deep model many application work explicitly regularize deep model human user might step process behind prediction little time specifically train deep time-series model class-probability prediction high accuracy closely model decision tree node use intuitive toy example well medical task treat sepsis hiv demonstrate new tree regularization yield model easy human simulate simpler l l penalty without sacrifice predictive power
