 randomized structural sparsity via constrained block subsampling improved sensitivity discriminative voxel identification paper consider voxel selection functional magnetic resonance image fmri brain data aim find complete set probably correlate discriminative voxels thus improve interpretation discovered potential biomarkers main difficulty extremely high dimensional voxel space training sample result unreliable feature selection order deal difficulty stability selection receive great deal attention lately especially due finite sample control false discovery transparent principle choose proper amount regularization however fail make explicit use correlation property structural information discriminative feature lead large false negative rate word many relevant probably correlate discriminative voxels miss thus propose new variant stability selection randomize structural sparsity incorporate idea structural sparsity numerical experiment demonstrate method superior control false negative also keep control false positive inherit stability selection
