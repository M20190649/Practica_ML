 joint optimization variable selection high-dimensional gaussian process maximize high-dimensional non-convex function noisy observation notoriously hard problem one arise many application paper tackle challenge model unknown function sample high-dimensional gaussian process gp distribution assume unknown function depend relevant variable show possible perform joint variable selection gp optimization provide strong performance guarantee algorithm bound sample complexity variable selection well provide cumulative regret bound provide empirical evidence effectiveness algorithm several benchmark optimization problem
