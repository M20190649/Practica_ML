 generalize emphatic temporal difference learning bias-variance analysis consider off-policy evaluation problem markov decision process function approximation propose generalization recently introduce emph emphatic temporal difference etd algorithm citep suttonmw encompass original etd lambda well several off-policy evaluation algorithm special case call framework etd introduced parameter beta control decay rate importance-sampling term study condition project fixed-point equation underlie etd involve contraction operator allow u present first asymptotic error bound bias etd result show original etd algorithm always involve contraction operator bias bound moreover control beta propose generalization allow trading-off bias variance reduction thereby achieve low total error
