 practically perfect property perfectness play important role theory bayesian network first existence perfect distribution arbitrary set variable direct acyclic graph implies various method read independence structure graph e.g. pearl lauritzen dawid larsen leimer complete second asymptotic reliability various search method guarantee assumption generate distribution perfect e.g. spirtes glymour scheines chickering meek provide lower-bound probability sample non-perfect distribution use fixed number bit represent parameter bayesian network bound approach zero exponentially fast one increase number bit use represent parameter result imply perfect distribution fixed-length representation exist also provide lower-bound number bit need guarantee distribution sample uniform dirichlet distribution perfect probability great result useful construct randomized reduction hardness proof
