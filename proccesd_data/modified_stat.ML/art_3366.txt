 tight continuous relaxation balanced k -cut problem spectral clustering relaxation normalize ratio cut become one standard graph-based clustering method exist method computation multiple cluster correspond balance k -cut graph either base greedy technique heuristic weak connection original motivation minimize normalized cut paper propose new tight continuous relaxation balanced k -cut problem show related recently propose relaxation case loose lead poor performance practice optimization tight continuous relaxation propose new algorithm difficult sum-of-ratios minimization problem achieve monotonic descent extensive comparison show method outperform exist approach ratio cut balance k -cut criterion
