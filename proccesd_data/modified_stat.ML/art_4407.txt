 asymmetric variational autoencoders variational inference latent variable model prevalent various machine learning problem typically solve maximize evidence low bound elbo true data likelihood respect variational distribution however freely enrich family variational distribution challenge since elbo require variational likelihood evaluation latent variable paper propose novel framework enrich variational family incorporate auxiliary variable variational family result inference network n't require density evaluation auxiliary variable thus complex implicit density auxiliary variable construct neural network show actual variational posterior propose approach essentially model rich probabilistic mixture simple variational posterior index auxiliary variable thus flexible inference model build empirical evaluation several density estimation task demonstrate effectiveness propose method
