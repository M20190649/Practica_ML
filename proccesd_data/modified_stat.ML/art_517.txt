 general theory hypothesis test confidence region sparse high dimensional model consider problem uncertainty assessment low dimensional component high dimensional model specifically propose decorrelated score function handle impact high dimensional nuisance parameter consider hypothesis test confidence region generic penalize m-estimators unlike exist inferential method tailor individual model approach provide general framework high dimensional inference applicable wide range application test perspective develop general theorem characterize limiting distribution decorrelated score test statistic null hypothesis local alternative result provide asymptotic guarantee type error local power propose test furthermore show decorrelated score function use construct point confidence region estimator semiparametrically efficient also generalize framework broaden application first extend handle high dimensional null hypothesis number parameter interest increase exponentially fast sample size second establish theory model misspecification third go beyond likelihood framework introduce generalize score test base general loss function thorough numerical study conduct back developed theoretical result
