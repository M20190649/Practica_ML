 joint estimation multiple dependent gaussian graphical model application mouse genomics gaussian graphical model widely use represent conditional dependence among random variable paper propose novel estimator data arise group gaussian graphical model dependent motivating example model gene expression collect multiple tissue individual multivariate outcome affect dependency act level specific tissue also level whole body exist method assume independence among graph applicable case estimate multiple dependent graph decompose problem two graphical layer systemic layer affect outcome thereby induces cross- graph dependence category-specific layer represent graph-specific variation propose graphical em technique estimate layer jointly establish estimation consistency selection sparsistency propose estimator confirm simulation em method superior simple one-step method apply technique mouse genomics data obtain biologically plausible result
