 statistical perspective sample score linear regression paper consider statistical problem learn linear model noisy sample exist work focus approximate least square solution use leverage-based score importance sample distribution however finite sample statistical guarantee computationally efficient optimal sample strategy propose evaluate statistical property different sample strategy propose simple yet effective estimator easy theoretical analysis useful multitask linear regression derive exact mean square error propose estimator give sampling score base minimize mean square error propose optimal sampling score estimator predictor show influence noise-to-signal ratio numerical simulation match theoretical analysis well
