 tensor factorization via matrix factorization tensor factorization arises many machine learn application knowledge base modeling parameter estimation latent variable model however numerical method tensor factorization reach level maturity matrix factorization method paper propose new method cp tensor factorization use random projection reduce problem simultaneous matrix diagonalization method conceptually simple also applies non-orthogonal asymmetric tensor arbitrary order prove small number random projection essentially preserve spectral information tensor allow u remove dependence eigengap plague early tensor-to-matrix reduction experimentally method outperform exist tensor factorization method simulate data two real datasets
