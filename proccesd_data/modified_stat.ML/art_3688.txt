 alternate direction method multiplier regularized multiclass support vector machine support vector machine svm originally design binary classification lot effort put generalize binary svm multiclass svm msvm complex problem initially msvms solve consider dual formulation quadratic program solve standard second-order method however duals msvms regularizers usually difficult formulate computationally expensive solve paper focus several regularize msvms extend alternate direction method multiplier admm msvms use splitting technique consider msvms write two-block convex program admm global convergence guarantee numerical experiment synthetic real data demonstrate high efficiency accuracy algorithm
