 efficient approach sparse linear discriminant analysis present novel approach formulation resolution sparse linear discriminant analysis lda proposal base penalized optimal scoring exact equivalence penalized lda contrary multi-class approach base regression class indicator propose far sparsity obtain thanks group-lasso penalty select feature discriminant direction experiment demonstrate approach generate extremely parsimonious model without compromise prediction performance besides prediction result sparse discriminant direction also amenable low-dimensional representation data algorithm highly efficient medium large number variable thus particularly well suit analysis gene expression data
