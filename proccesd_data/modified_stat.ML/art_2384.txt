 infer parameter structure latent variable model variational bayes current method learn graphical model latent variable fixed structure estimate optimal value model parameter whereas approach usually produce overfitting suboptimal generalization performance carry bayesian program compute full posterior distribution parameter remain difficult problem moreover learn structure model latent variable bayesian approach crucial yet harder problem paper present variational bayes framework provide solution problem approach approximate full posterior distribution model parameter structure well latent variable analytical manner without resort sample method unlike laplace approximation posterior generally non-gaussian hessian need compute result algorithm generalize standard expectation maximization algorithm convergence guarantee demonstrate algorithm apply large class model several domain include unsupervised clustering blind source separation
