 uniform hypergraph partitioning provable tensor method sample technique series recent work generalise consistency result stochastic block model literature case uniform non-uniform hypergraphs present paper continue line study focus partition weighted uniform hypergraphs -- -a problem often encounter computer vision work motivate two issue arise hypergraph partition approach use tackle computer vision problem uniform hypergraphs construct higher-order learning contain edge negligible weight thus adjacency tensor nearly sparse yet binary ii serious concern standard partition algorithms need compute edge weight computationally expensive hypergraphs usually resolve practice merge cluster algorithm tensor sample strategy -- -an approach yet analyse rigorously build early work partition dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs ghoshdastidar dukkipati icml address aforementioned issue propose provable efficient partition algorithm analysis justify empirical success practical sample technique also complement theoretical finding elaborate empirical comparison various hypergraph partition scheme
