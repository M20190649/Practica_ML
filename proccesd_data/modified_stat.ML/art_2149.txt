 flexible modeling latent task structure multitask learn multitask learning algorithm typically design assume fix priori know latent structure share task however usually unclear type latent task structure appropriate give multitask learn problem ideally right latent task structure learn data-driven manner present flexible nonparametric bayesian model posit mixture factor analyzer structure task nonparametric aspect make model expressive enough subsume many exist model latent task structure e.g mean-regularized task cluster task low-rank linear non-linear subspace assumption task etc moreover also learn general task structure address shortcoming model present variational inference algorithm model experimental result synthetic real-world datasets regression classification problem demonstrate effectiveness propose method
