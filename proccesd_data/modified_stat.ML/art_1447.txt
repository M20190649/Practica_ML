 improved modified cholesky decomposition method inverse covariance matrix estimation modify cholesky decomposition commonly use inverse covariance matrix estimation give specified order random variable however order variable often available pre-determined hence propose novel estimator address variable order issue modified cholesky decomposition estimate sparse inverse covariance matrix key idea effectively combine set estimate obtain multiple permutation variable order efficiently encourage sparse structure resultant estimate use thresholding technique combine cholesky factor matrix consistent property propose estimate establish weak regularity condition simulation study show superior performance propose method comparison several exist approach also apply propose method linear discriminant analysis analyze real-data example classification
