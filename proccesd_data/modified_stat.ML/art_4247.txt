 neural sequence model train via -divergence minimization propose new neural sequence model train method objective function define alpha -divergence demonstrate objective function generalize maximum-likelihood ml -based reinforcement learn rl -based objective function special case i.e. ml corresponds alpha rl alpha also show gradient objective function consider mixture ml- rl-based objective gradient experimental result machine translation task show minimize objective function alpha outperforms alpha correspond ml-based method
