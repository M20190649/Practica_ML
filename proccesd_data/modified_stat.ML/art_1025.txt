 destination prediction trajectory distribution base model paper propose new method predict final destination vehicle trip base initial partial trajectory first review obtain cluster trajectory describe user behaviour explain model main traffic flow pattern mixture gaussian distribution yield density base clustering location produce data driven grid similar point within pattern present model use predict final destination new trajectory base first location use two step procedure first assign new trajectory cluster mot likely belongs secondly use characteristic trajectory inside cluster predict final destination finally present experimental result method classification trajectory final destination prediction datasets timestamped gps-location taxi trip test method two different datasets assess capacity method adapt automatically different subset
