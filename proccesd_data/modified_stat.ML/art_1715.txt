 sparse signal recovery temporally correlate source vector use sparse bayesian learning address sparse signal recovery problem context multiple measurement vector mmv element nonzero row solution matrix temporally correlate exist algorithm consider temporal correlation thus performance degrades significantly correlation work propose block sparse bayesian learning framework model temporal correlation framework derive two sparse bayesian learn sbl algorithm superior recovery performance compare exist algorithm especially presence high temporal correlation furthermore algorithm well handle highly underdetermined problem require less row-sparsity solution matrix also provide analysis global local minimum cost function show sbl cost function desirable property global minimum sparse solution mmv problem extensive experiment also provide interesting result motivate future theoretical research mmv model
