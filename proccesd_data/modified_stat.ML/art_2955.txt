 direct method estimate causal order linear non-gaussian acyclic model structural equation model bayesian network widely use analyze causal relation continuous variable framework linear acyclic model typically use model datagenerating process variable recently show use non-gaussianity identifies causal ordering variable linear acyclic model without use prior knowledge network structure case conventional method however exist estimation method base iterative search algorithm may converge correct solution finite number step paper propose new direct method estimate causal order base non-gaussianity contrast previous method algorithm require algorithmic parameter guarantee converge right solution within small fixed number step data strictly follow model
