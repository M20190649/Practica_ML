 coarse-to-fine sequential monte carlo probabilistic program many practical technique probabilistic inference require sequence distribution interpolate tractable distribution intractable distribution interest usually sequence use simple e.g. base geometric average distribution model express probabilistic program model highly structured object use derive anneal sequence sensitive domain structure propose algorithm transform probabilistic program coarse-to-fine program marginal distribution original program generate data increase level detail coarse fine apply algorithm ising model depth-from-disparity variation factorial hidden markov model show preliminary evidence use coarse-to-fine model make exist generic inference algorithms efficient
