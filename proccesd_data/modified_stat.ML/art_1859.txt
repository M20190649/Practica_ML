 rferns implementation random ferns method general-purpose machine learning paper present extended implementation random ferns algorithm contain r package rferns differ original ability consume categorical numerical attribute instead binary one also instead use simple attribute subspace ensemble employ bag thus produce error approximation variable importance measure model random forest algorithm also present benchmark result show although random fern accuracy mostly small achieve random forest speed good quality importance measure provide make rferns reasonable choice specific application
