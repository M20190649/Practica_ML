 potential benefit filter versus hyper-parameter optimization quality induced model learning algorithm dependent quality training data hyper-parameters supply learning algorithm prior work show improve quality training data i.e. remove low quality instance tune learn algorithm hyper-parameters significantly improve quality induced model comparison two method lack though paper estimate compare potential benefit filter hyper-parameter optimization estimate potential benefit give overly optimistic estimate also empirically demonstrate approximation maximum potential benefit method find significantly improve induced model improve quality training set great potential effect hyper-parameter optimization
