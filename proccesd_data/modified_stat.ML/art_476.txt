 scalable nonparametric bayesian inference point process gaussian process paper propose first non-parametric bayesian model use gaussian process make inference poisson point process without resort gridding domain introduce latent thin point unlike compete model scale cubically squared memory requirement number data point model linear complexity memory requirement propose mcmc sampler show model faster accurate generate less correlated sample compete model synthetic real-life data finally show model easily handle data size consider thus far alternate approach
