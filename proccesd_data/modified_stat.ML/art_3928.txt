 semi-supervised active learning support vector machine novel approach exploit structure information data today 's information society data emerges e.g social network technical application business application company try commercialize data use data mining machine learning method purpose data categorize classify often high monetary temporal cost effective approach reduce cost apply kind active learn al method al control training process classifier specific query individual data point sample label e.g. provide class membership domain expert however analysis current al research show al still shortcoming particular structure information give spatial pattern un label data input space classification model e.g. cluster information use insufficient way addition many exist al technique pay little attention practical applicability meet challenge article present several technique together build new approach combine al semi-supervised learning ssl support vector machine svm classification task structure information capture mean probabilistic model iteratively improve runtime label information become available probabilistic model consider selection strategy base distance density diversity distribution d strategy information al kernel function responsibility weight mahalanobis kernel svm approach fuse generative discriminative modeling technique benchmark data set mnist data set show new solution yield significantly good result state-of-the-art method
