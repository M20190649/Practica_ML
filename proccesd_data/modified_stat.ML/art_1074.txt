 dynamic hierarchical dirichlet process abnormal behaviour detection video paper propose novel dynamic hierarchical dirichlet process topic model consider dependence successive observation conventional posterior inference algorithm kind model require processing whole data several pass computationally intractable massive sequential data design batch online inference algorithm base gibbs sampling propose model allow process sequential data incrementally update model new observation model apply abnormal behaviour detection video sequence new abnormality measure propose decision making propose method compare method base non- dynamic hierarchical dirichlet process also derive online gibbs sampler abnormality measure result synthetic real data show consideration dynamic topic model improve classification performance abnormal behaviour detection
