 tree-structured boosting connection gradient boost stump full decision tree additive model produce gradient boosting full interaction model classification regression tree cart widely use algorithm investigate largely isolation show model exist along spectrum reveal never-before-known connection two approach paper introduce novel technique call tree-structured boosting create single decision tree show method produce model equivalent cart gradient boost stump extreme vary single parameter although tree-structured boosting design primarily provide model interpretability predictive performance need high-stake application like medicine also produce decision tree represent hybrid model cart boost stump outperform either approach
