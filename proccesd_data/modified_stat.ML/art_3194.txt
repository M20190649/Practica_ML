 pairwise rotation hash high-dimensional feature binary hashing widely use effective approximate near neighbor search even though various binary hashing method propose method feasible extremely high-dimensional feature often use visual task today propose novel highly sparse linear hash method base pairwise rotation encode cost propose algorithm mathrm n log n n-dimensional feature whereas exist state-of-the-art method typically mathrm n propose method also remarkably faster learning phase along efficiency retrieval accuracy comparable slightly outperform state-of-the-art pairwise rotation use method formulate analytical study trade-off relationship quantization error entropy binary code although hash criterion widely use previous research analytical behavior rarely study building block algorithm base analytical solution thus provide fairly simple efficient procedure
