 fairness diversity randomness algorithmic decision make consider binary decision making process single machine learn classifier replaces multitude human raise question resulting loss diversity decision making process study potential benefit use random classifier ensemble instead single classifier context fairness-aware learning demonstrate various attractive property ensemble fair classifier guarantee fair several different measure fairness ii ensemble unfair classifier still achieve fair outcome iii ensemble classifier achieve good accuracy-fairness trade-off single classifier finally introduce notion distributional fairness characterize potential benefit random classifier ensemble
