 graph matching relax risk graph matching -- -aligning pair graph minimize edge disagreement -- -has receive wide-spread attention theoretical applied community past several decade include combinatorics computer vision connectomics attention partially attribute computational difficulty although many heuristic previously propose literature approximately solve graph matching theoretical support performance common technique relax discrete problem continuous problem therefore enable practitioner bring gradient-descent-type algorithm bear prove indefinite relaxation solve exactly almost always discover optimal permutation common convex relaxation almost always fail discover optimal permutation theoretical result suggest initialize indefinite algorithm convex optimum might yield improved practical performance indeed experimental result illuminate corroborate theoretical finding demonstrate excellent result achieve benchmark real data problem amalgamate two approach
