 review multivariate distribution count data derive poisson distribution poisson distribution widely study use model univariate count-valued data multivariate generalization poisson distribution permit dependency however far less popular yet real-world high-dimensional count-valued data find word count genomics crime statistic example exhibit rich dependency motivate need multivariate distribution appropriately model data review multivariate distribution derive univariate poisson categorize model three main class marginal distribution poisson joint distribution mixture independent multivariate poisson distribution node-conditional distribution derive poisson discuss development multiple instance class compare model term interpretability theory empirically compare multiple model class three real-world datasets vary data characteristic different domain namely traffic accident data biological next generation sequence data text data empirical experiment develop intuition comparative advantage disadvantage class multivariate distribution derive poisson finally suggest new research direction explore subsequent discussion section
