 sparse representation multivariate extreme application anomaly rank extreme play special role anomaly detection beyond inference simulation purpose probabilistic tool borrow extreme value theory evt angular measure also use design novel statistical learning method anomaly detection ranking paper propose new algorithm base multivariate evt learn rank observation high dimensional space respect degree 'abnormality procedure rely original dimension-reduction technique extreme domain possibly produce sparse representation multivariate extreme allows gain insight dependence structure thereof escape curse dimensionality representation output unsupervised methodology propose combine anomaly detection technique tailor non-extreme data perform linearly dimension almost linearly data dn log n fit large scale problem approach paper novel evt never use multivariate version field anomaly detection illustrative experimental result provide strong empirical evidence relevance approach
