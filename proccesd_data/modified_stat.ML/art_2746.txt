 lasso equivalent quadratic penalize model least absolute shrinkage selection operator lasso ridge regression produce usually different estimate although input loss function parameterization penalty identical paper look ridge lasso model identical solution set turn lasso model shrink vector lambda quadratic penalized model shrink matrix out product lambda equivalent sense equal solution achieve restrict estimate positive n't limit area application since easily decompose every estimate positive negative part result problem solve non negative least square algorithm beside quadratic penalized model augmented regression model positive bound estimate develop also equivalent lasso model probably faster solve
