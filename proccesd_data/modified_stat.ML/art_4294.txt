 theoretical limitation encoder-decoder gan architectures encoder-decoder gans architecture e.g. bigan ali seek add inference mechanism gans setup consist small encoder deep net map data-points succinct encoding intuition force train encoder alongside usual generator force system learn meaningful mapping code data-point vice-versa improve learning target distribution ameliorate mode-collapse also yield meaningful code useful feature downstream task current paper show rigorously even real-life distribution image encode-decoder gan train objectives prevent mode collapse i.e objective near-optimal even generate distribution low finite support b prevent learn meaningless code data -- essentially white noise thus encoder-decoder gans indeed work must due reason yet understood since training objective low even meaningless solution
