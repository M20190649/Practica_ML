 efficient algorithm extremely large multi-task regression massive structured sparsity develop highly scalable optimization method call hierarchical group-thresholding solve multi-task regression model complex structure sparsity constraint input output space despite recent emergence several efficient optimization algorithm tackle complex sparsity-inducing regularizers true scalability practical high-dimensional problem huge amount e.g. million sparsity pattern need enforce remain open challenge exist algorithm must deal pattern exhaustively every iteration computationally prohibitive propose algorithm address scalability problem screen multiple group coefficient simultaneously systematically employ hierarchical tree representation group constraint accelerate process remove irrelevant constraint take advantage inclusion relationship group sparsity thereby avoid deal constraint every optimization step necessitate optimization operation small number outstanding coefficient experiment demonstrate efficiency method simulation datasets application detect genetic variant associate gene expression trait
