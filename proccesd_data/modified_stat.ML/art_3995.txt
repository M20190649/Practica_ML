 complex-valued kernel method regression usually complex-valued rkhs present straightforward application real-valued case paper prove procedure yield limited solution regression show another kernel denote pseudo kernel need learn function complex-valued field accordingly derive novel rkhs include widely rkhs wrkhs pseudo-kernel cancel wrkhs reduces complex-valued rkhs previous approach address kernel pseudo-kernel design pay attention kernel pseudo-kernel complex-valued experiment include report remarkable improvement simple scenario real imaginary part different similitude relation give input case real imaginary part correlate context novel result revisit problem non-linear channel equalization show wrkhs help design efficient solution
