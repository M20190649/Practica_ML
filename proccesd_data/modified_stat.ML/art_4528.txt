 empirical similarity absent data generation imbalanced classification training data two-class classification problem overwhelm one class classification technique fail correctly identify data point belong underrepresented class propose similarity-based imbalanced classification sbic learn pattern training data base empirical similarity function take imbalanced structure training data account sbic utilizes concept absent data i.e data minority class help good find boundary two class sbic simultaneously optimize weight empirical similarity function find location absent data point sbic use embedded mechanism synthetic data generation modify training dataset alter algorithm suit imbalanced datasets therefore sbic use idea major school thought imbalanced classification like cost-sensitive approach sbic operate algorithm level handle imbalanced structure similar synthetic data generation approach utilize property unobserved data point minority class application sbic imbalanced datasets suggest comparable case outperforms commonly use classification technique imbalanced datasets
