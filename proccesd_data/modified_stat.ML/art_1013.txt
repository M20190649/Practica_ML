 dynamic pricing demand covariates consider firm sell product period without know demand function firm sequentially set price earn revenue learn underlying demand function simultaneously natural heuristic problem commonly use practice greedy iterative least square gils time period gils estimate demand linear function price apply least square set prior price realize demand price maximize revenue give estimate demand function use next time period performance measure regret expected revenue loss optimal oracle pricing policy demand function know recently den boer zwart keskin zeevi demonstrate gils sub-optimal introduce algorithm integrate force price dispersion gils achieve asymptotically optimal performance paper consider dynamic pricing problem data-rich environment particular assume firm know expected demand particular price historical data period set price firm access extra information demand covariates may predictive demand prove setting gils achieves asymptotically optimal regret order log also show follow surprising result original dynamic pricing problem den boer zwart keskin zeevi inclusion set covariates gils potential demand covariates even though could carry information would make gils asymptotically optimal validate result via extensive numerical simulation synthetic real data set
