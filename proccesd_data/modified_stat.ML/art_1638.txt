 compute p-values lingam output via multiscale bootstrap structural equation model bayesian network widely use study causal relationship continuous variable recently non-gaussian method call lingam propose discover causal model extend various direction important problem lingam result affect random sampling data statistical method thus analysis statistical reliability confidence level conduct common method evaluate confidence level bootstrap method however confidence level compute ordinary bootstrap method know bias probability-value p -value hypothesis testing paper propose new procedure apply advanced bootstrap method call multiscale bootstrap compute confidence level i.e. p-values lingam output multiscale bootstrap method give unbiased p -values asymptotic much high accuracy experiment artificial data demonstrate utility approach
