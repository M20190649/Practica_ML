 adaptive learning cartesian product reproduce kernel hilbert space propose novel adaptive learn algorithm base iterative orthogonal projection cartesian product multiple reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhss task estimate track nonlinear function suppose contain multiple component linear nonlinear component ii high- low- frequency component etc case use multiple rkhss permit compact representation multicomponent function propose algorithm two different method author meet multikernel adaptive filtering algorithm hyperplane projection along affine subspace hypass certain particular case sum space rkhss isomorphic product space hence propose algorithm also regard iterative projection method sum space efficacy propose algorithm show numerical example
