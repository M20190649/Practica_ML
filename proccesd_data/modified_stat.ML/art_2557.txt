 control precision-recall tradeoff differential dependency network analysis graphical model gain lot attention recently tool learn represent dependency among variable multivariate data often domain scientist look specifically difference among dependency network different condition population e.g difference regulatory network different specie difference dependency network diseased versus healthy population standard method find difference learn dependency network condition independently compare show approach prone high false discovery rate low precision render analysis useless show impose bias towards learn similar dependency network condition false discovery rate reduce acceptable level cost find reduced number difference algorithm develop transfer learning literature use vary strength imposed similarity bias provide natural mechanism smoothly adjust differential precision-recall tradeoff cater requirement analysis conduct present real case study oncological neurological domain expert use propose technique extract useful differential network shed light biological process involve cancer brain function
