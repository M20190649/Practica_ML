 probabilistic segmentation via total variation regularization present convex approach probabilistic segmentation modeling time series data approach build upon recent advance multivariate total variation regularization seek learn separate set parameter distribution observation time point additional penalty encourage parameter remain constant time propose efficient optimization method solve result large optimization problem two-stage procedure estimate recur cluster model base upon kernel density estimation finally show number real-world segmentation task result method often perform well good exist latent variable model substantially easy train
