 minimize misclassification error rate use surrogate convex loss carefully study well minimize convex surrogate loss function corresponds minimize misclassification error rate problem binary classification linear predictor particular show amongst convex surrogate loss hinge loss give essentially best possible bound convex loss function misclassification error rate result linear predictor term best possible margin error rate also provide low bound specific convex surrogates show different commonly used loss qualitatively differ
