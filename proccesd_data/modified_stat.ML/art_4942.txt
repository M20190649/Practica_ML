 medical image denoising use convolutional denoising autoencoders image denoising important pre-processing step medical image analysis different algorithm propose past three decade vary denoising performance recently outperform conventional method deep learn base model show great promise method however limit requirement large train sample size high computational cost paper show use small sample size denoising autoencoders construct use convolutional layer use efficient denoising medical image heterogeneous image combine boost sample size increased denoising performance simplest network reconstruct image corruption level high noise signal differentiable human eye
