 hi-rf incremental learn random forest large-scale multi-class data classification recent year dynamically grow data incrementally grow number class pose new challenge large-scale data classification research traditional method struggle balance precision computational burden data number class increase however method weak precision others time-consuming paper propose incremental learning method namely heterogeneous incremental near class mean random forest hi-rf handle issue heterogeneous method either replaces tree update tree leaf random forest adaptively reduce computational time comparable performance data new class arrive specifically keep accuracy one proportion tree replace new ncm decision tree reduce computational load rest tree update leaf probability out-of-bag estimation out-of-bag boosting propose balance accuracy computational efficiency fair experiment conduct demonstrate comparable precision much less computational time
