 subset selection gaussian markov random field give gaussian markov random field consider problem select subset variable observe minimize total expect squared prediction error unobserved variable first show find exact solution np-hard even restricted class gaussian markov random field call gaussian free field arise semi-supervised learning computer vision give simple greedy approximation algorithm gaussian free field arbitrary graph finally give message passing algorithm general gaussian markov random field bounded tree-width graph
