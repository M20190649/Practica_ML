 sparse fisher 's linear discriminant analysis partially label data classification important tool many useful application among many classification method fisher 's linear discriminant analysis lda traditional model-based approach make use covariance information however high-dimensional low-sample size setting lda directly deploy sample covariance invertible modern method design deal high-dimensional data may fully use covariance information lda hence situation still desirable use model-based method lda classification article exploit potential lda complicated data setting many real application costly manually place label observation hence often small portion label data available large number observation leave without label great challenge obtain good classification performance label data alone especially dimension great size label data order overcome issue propose semi-supervised sparse lda classifier take advantage seemingly useless unlabeled data provide additional information help boost classification performance situation direct estimation method use reconstruct lda achieve sparsity meanwhile employ difference-convex algorithm handle non-convex loss function associate unlabeled data theoretical property propose classifier study simulated example help understand information extract unlabeled data useful real data example illustrate usefulness propose method
