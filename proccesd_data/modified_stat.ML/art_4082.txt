 spatial contrasting deep unsupervised learn convolutional network mark place last year best performing model various visual task however suit supervised learning large amount label data previous attempt make use unlabeled data improve model performance apply unsupervised technique attempt require different architecture train method work present novel approach unsupervised training convolutional network base contrast spatial region within image criterion employ within conventional neural network train use standard technique sgd back-propagation thus complement supervise method
