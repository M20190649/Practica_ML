 loss minimization parameter estimation heavy tail work study application generalization simple estimation technique provide exponential concentration heavy-tailed distribution assume bound low-order moment show technique use approximate minimization smooth strongly convex loss specifically least square linear regression instance -dimensional estimator require tilde log delta random sample obtain constant factor approximation optimal least square loss probability delta without require covariates noise bound subgaussian provide application sparse linear regression low-rank covariance matrix estimation similar allowance noise covariate distribution core technique generalization median-of-means estimator arbitrary metric space
