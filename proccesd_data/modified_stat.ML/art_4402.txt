 adversarial phenomenon eye bayesian deep learning deep learning model vulnerable adversarial example i.e image obtain via deliberate imperceptible perturbation model misclassifies high confidence however class confidence incomplete picture uncertainty therefore use principled bayesian method capture model uncertainty prediction observe adversarial misclassification provide extensive study different bayesian neural network attack white-box black-box setup behaviour network noise attack clean test data compare observe bayesian neural network uncertain prediction adversarial perturbation behaviour similar one observe random gaussian perturbation thus conclude bayesian neural network consider detect adversarial example
