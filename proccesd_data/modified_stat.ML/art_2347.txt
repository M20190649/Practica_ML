 sum-over-forests density index identifying dense region graph work introduce novel nonparametric density index define graph sum-over-forests sof density index base clear intuitive idea high-density region graph characterize fact contain large amount low-cost tree high outdegrees low-density region contain one therefore boltzmann probability distribution countable set forest graph define large high-cost forest occur low probability short low-cost forest occur high probability sof density index node define expected outdegree node non-trivial tree forest thus provide measure density around node follow matrix-forest theorem statistical physic framework show sof density index easily compute closed form simple matrix inversion experiment artificial real data set show propose index performs well find dense region graph various origin
