 projection free rank-drop step frank-wolfe fw algorithm widely use solve nuclear norm constrain problem since require projection however fw often yield high rank intermediate iterates expensive time space cost large problem address issue propose rank-drop method nuclear norm constrain problem goal generate descent step lead rank decrease maintain low-rank solution throughout algorithm moreover optimization problem constrain ensure rank-drop step also feasible readily incorporate projection-free minimization method e.g. frank-wolfe demonstrate incorporate rank-drop step frank-wolfe algorithm rank solution greatly reduce compare original frank-wolfe common variant
