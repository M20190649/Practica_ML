 ica base split generalize gaussian independent component analysis ica one basic tool data analysis aim find coordinate system component data independent popular ica method use kurtosis metric non-gaussianity maximize fastica jade however assumption fourth-order moment kurtosis may always satisfy practice one possible solution use third-order moment skewness instead kurtosis apply ica sg ecoica paper present competitive approach ica base split generalize gaussian distribution sggd well adapt heavy-tailed well asymmetric data consequently obtain method work well classical approach case heavy tail non-symmetric data end abstract
