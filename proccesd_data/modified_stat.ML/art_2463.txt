 abc reinforcement learn paper introduce simple general framework likelihood-free bayesian reinforcement learning approximate bayesian computation abc main advantage require prior distribution class simulator generative model useful domain analytical probabilistic model underlying process complex formulate detailed simulation model available abc-rl allow use bayesian reinforcement learning technique even case addition see extension rollout algorithm case know correct model draw rollouts experimentally demonstrate potential approach comparison lspi finally introduce theorem show abc sound methodology principle even non-sufficient statistic use
