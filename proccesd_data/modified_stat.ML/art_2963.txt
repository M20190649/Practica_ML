 warped mixture nonparametric cluster shape mixture gaussians fit single curved heavy-tailed cluster report data contain many cluster produce appropriate clustering introduce model warp latent mixture gaussians produce nonparametric cluster shape possibly low-dimensional latent mixture model allow u summarize property high-dimensional cluster density manifold describe data number manifold well shape dimension manifold automatically infer derive simple inference scheme model analytically integrate mixture parameter warping function show model effective density estimation perform good infinite gaussian mixture model recover true number cluster produce interpretable summary high-dimensional datasets
