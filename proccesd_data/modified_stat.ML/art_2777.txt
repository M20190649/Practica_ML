 sequential model-based ensemble optimization one tedious task application machine learning model selection i.e hyperparameter selection fortunately recent progress make automation process use sequential model-based optimization smbo method use optimize cross-validation performance learning algorithm value hyperparameters however well know ensemble learned model almost consistently outperform single model even properly select paper thus propose extension smbo method automatically construct ensemble method build recently propose ensemble construction paradigm know agnostic bayesian learning experiment regression classification data set confirm success propose approach able outperform model selection smbo
