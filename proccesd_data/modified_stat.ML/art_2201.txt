 generalization bound metric similarity learning recently metric learning similarity learning attract large amount interest many model optimisation algorithm propose however relatively little work generalization analysis method paper derive novel generalization bound metric similarity learning particular first show generalization analysis reduces estimation rademacher average sums-of-i.i.d sample-blocks relate specific matrix norm derive generalization bound metric similarity learn different matrix-norm regularisers estimate specific rademacher complexity analysis indicate sparse metric similarity learn l -norm regularisation could lead significantly good bound frobenius-norm regularisation novel generalization analysis develop refine technique u-statistics rademacher complexity analysis
