 tyler 's covariance matrix estimator elliptical model convex structure address structured covariance estimation elliptical distribution assume covariance priori know belong give convex set e.g. set toeplitz band matrix consider general method moment gmm optimization apply robust tyler 's scatter m-estimator subject convex constraint unfortunately gmm turn non-convex due objective instead propose new coca estimator convex relaxation efficiently solve prove relaxation tight unconstrained case finite number sample constrained case asymptotically illustrate advantage coca synthetic simulation structured compound gaussian distribution example coca outperforms compete method tyler 's estimator projection onto structure set
