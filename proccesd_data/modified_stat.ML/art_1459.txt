 fast mcmc sample algorithm polytopes propose analyze two new mcmc sample algorithm vaidya walk john walk generate sample uniform distribution polytope random walk sample algorithm derive interior point method former base volumetric-logarithmic barrier introduce vaidya whereas latter use john 's ellipsoid show vaidya walk mix significantly few step logarithmic-barrier base dikin walk study past work polytope mathbb r define n linear constraint show mixing time warm start bound mathcal n compare mathcal nd mix time bound dikin walk cost step vaidya walk order dikin walk twice large term constant pre-factors john walk prove mathcal cdot log n bound mixing time conjecture improved variant could achieve mixing time mathcal cdot text polylog n additionally propose variant vaidya john walk mix polynomial time deterministic starting point speed-up vaidya walk dikin walk illustrate numerical example
