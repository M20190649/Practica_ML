 exact block-wise optimization group lasso sparse group lasso linear regression group lasso penalized regression method use regression problem covariates partition group promote sparsity group level exist method find group lasso estimator either use gradient projection method update entire coefficient vector simultaneously step update one group coefficient time use inexact line search approximate optimal value group coefficient group coefficient fix present new method computation group lasso linear regression case single line search sl algorithm operate compute exact optimal value group coefficient fix one univariate line search perform simulation demonstrate sl algorithm often efficient exist computational method also extend sl algorithm sparse group lasso problem via sign single line search ssls algorithm give theoretical result support algorithm
