 make tree ensemble interpretable bayesian model selection approach tree ensemble random forest boost tree renowned high prediction performance however interpretability critically limited due enormous complexity study present method make complex tree ensemble interpretable simplify model specifically formalize simplification tree ensemble model selection problem give complex tree ensemble aim obtain simple representation essentially equivalent original one end derive bayesian model selection algorithm optimize simplified model maintain prediction performance numerical experiment several datasets show complicate tree ensemble reasonably approximate interpretable
