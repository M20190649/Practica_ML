 algebraic variety model high-rank matrix completion consider generalization low-rank matrix completion case data belongs algebraic variety i.e data point solution system polynomial equation case original matrix possibly high-rank become low-rank map column high dimensional space monomial feature many well-studied extension linear model include affine subspace union describe variety model addition variety use model rich class nonlinear quadratic high degree curve surface study sampling requirement matrix completion variety model focus union affine subspace also propose efficient matrix completion algorithm minimize convex non-convex surrogate rank matrix monomial feature algorithm use well-known kernel trick avoid work directly high-dimensional monomial matrix show propose algorithm able recover synthetically generate data predict sampling complexity bound propose algorithm also outperform standard low rank matrix completion subspace cluster technique experiment real data
