 l sparse inverse covariance estimation recently focus penalized log-likelihood covariance estimation sparse inverse covariance precision matrix penalty responsible induce sparsity common choice convex l norm however best estimator performance always achieve penalty natural sparsity promote norm non-convex l penalty lack convexity deter use sparse maximum likelihood estimation paper consider non-convex l penalize log-likelihood inverse covariance estimation present novel cyclic descent algorithm optimization convergence local minimizer prove highly non-trivial demonstrate via simulation reduce bias superior quality l penalty compare l penalty
