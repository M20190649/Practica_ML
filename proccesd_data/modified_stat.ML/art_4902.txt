 glop global local penalty capture predictive heterogeneity face supervised learning problem hope rich enough data build model predict future instance well however practice problem exhibit predictive heterogeneity instance might relatively easy predict others might predictive outlier model train entire dataset perform well identify help focus future data collection present glop global local penalty framework capture predictive heterogeneity identify predictive outlier glop base penalized regression multitask learning improve learning leverage train signal information related task give two optimization algorithm glop one space-efficient another give full regularization path also characterize uniqueness term data tune parameter present empirical result synthetic data two health research problem
