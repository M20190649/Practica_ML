 dictionary learning approach factorial gaussian model paper develop parameter estimation method factorially parametrized model factorial gaussian mixture model factorial hidden markov model contribution two-fold first show emission matrix standard factorial model unidentifiable even true assignment matrix know secondly address issue identifiability make one component share assumption derive parameter learn algorithm case approach base dictionary learning problem form x r goal learn dictionary give data matrix x argue due specific structure activation matrix r shared component factorial mixture model incoherence assumption share component possible extract column matrix without need alternate estimation r
