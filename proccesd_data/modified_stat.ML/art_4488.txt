 interplay stability regret online learning paper consider stability online learn algorithm implication learnability bound regret introduce novel quantity call em forward regret intuitively measure good online learning algorithm allow one-step look-ahead future show give stability bound forward regret equivalent bound regret also show existence algorithm bounded regret imply existence stable algorithm bounded regret bound forward regret equivalence result apply general possibly non-convex problem best knowledge analysis provide first general connection stability regret online setting restrict particular class algorithm stability-regret connection provide simple recipe analyze regret incur online learning algorithm use framework analyze several exist online learn algorithm well approximate version algorithm like rda solve optimization problem iteration proof simple exist analysis respective algorithm show clear trade-off stability forward regret provide tight regret bound case furthermore use recipe analyze approximate version several algorithm follow-the-regularized-leader ftrl require solve optimization problem step
