 gibbs posterior variable selection high-dimensional classification data mining popular approach bayesian variable selection bvs one use prior posterior distribution select subset candidate variable enter model completely new direction consider study bvs gibbs posterior originate statistical mechanic gibbs posterior construct risk function practical interest classification error aim minimize risk function without model data probabilistically improve performance usual bayesian approach depend probability model may misspecified condition provide achieve good risk performance even presence high dimensionality number candidate variable k much large sample size n addition develop convenient markov chain monte carlo algorithm implement bvs gibbs posterior
