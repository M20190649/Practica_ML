 density-difference estimation address problem estimate difference two probability density naive approach two-step procedure first estimate two density separately compute difference however two-step procedure necessarily work well first step perform without regard second step thus small error incur first stage cause big error second stage paper propose single-shot procedure directly estimate density difference without separately estimate two density derive non-parametric finite-sample error bound propose single-shot density-difference estimator show achieve optimal convergence rate usefulness propose method also demonstrate experimentally
