 feature selection regression problem base morisita estimator intrinsic dimension data acquisition storage management improve key factor many phenomenon well know consequently irrelevant redundant feature artificially increase size datasets complicate learn task regression address problem feature selection method propose paper introduce new supervise filter base morisita estimator intrinsic dimension identify relevant feature distinguish redundant irrelevant information besides offer clear graphical representation result easily implement different programming language comprehensive numerical experiment conduct use simulated datasets characterize different level complexity sample size noise suggested algorithm also successfully test selection real world application compare rrelieff use extreme learning machine addition new measure feature relevance present discuss
