 additive covariance kernel high-dimensional gaussian process model gaussian process model -also call kriging models- often use mathematical approximation expensive experiment however number observation require build emulator become unrealistic use classical covariance kernel dimension input increase oder get round curse dimensionality popular approach consider simplified model additive model ambition present work give insight covariance kernel well suit build additive kriging model describe property resulting model
