 find dantzig selector proximity operator base fixed-point algorithm paper study simple iterative method find dantzig selector design linear regression problem method consist two main stage first stage approximate dantzig selector fixed-point formulation solution dantzig selector problem second stage construct new estimator regress data onto support approximated dantzig selector compare method alternate direction method present result numerical simulation use propose method alternating direction method synthetic real data set numerical simulation demonstrate two method produce result similar quality however propose method tend significantly faster
