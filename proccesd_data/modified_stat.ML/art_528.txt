 implementable confidence set high dimensional regression consider setting linear regression high dimension focus problem construct adaptive honest confidence set sparse parameter theta i.e want construct confidence set theta contain theta high probability small possible l diameter confidence set depend sparsity theta large wider confidence set however practice unknown paper focus construct confidence set theta contain theta high probability whose diameter adaptive unknown sparsity implementable practice
