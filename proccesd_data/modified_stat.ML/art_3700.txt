 explicit rate bound over-relaxed admm framework integral quadratic constraint lessard et al reduces computation upper bound convergence rate several optimization algorithm semi-definite programming sdp followup work nishihara et al applies technique entire family over-relaxed alternate direction method multiplier admm unfortunately provide explicit error bound sufficiently large value parameter problem leave computation general case numerical optimization problem paper provide exact analytical solution sdp obtain general explicit upper bound convergence rate entire family over-relaxed admm furthermore demonstrate possible extract sdp general bound well end numerical illustration result comparison convergence rate obtain admm known convergence rate gradient descent
