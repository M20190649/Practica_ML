 scalable learning non-decomposable objective modern retrieval system often drive underlying machine learn model goal system identify possibly rank relevant item give query context thus system typically evaluate use ranking-based performance metric area precision-recall curve f beta score precision fix recall etc obviously desirable train system optimize metric interest practice due scalability limitation exist approach optimize objective large-scale retrieval system instead train maximize classification accuracy hope performance measure via true objective also favorable work present unified framework use straightforward building block bound allow highly scalable optimization wide range ranking-based objective demonstrate advantage approach several real-life retrieval problem significantly large consider literature achieve substantial improvement performance accuracy-objective baseline
