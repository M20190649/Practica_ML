 compact hyperplane hash bilinear function hyperplane hash aim rapidly search near point hyperplane show practical impact scale active learning svms unfortunately exist randomize method need long hash code achieve reasonable search accuracy thus suffer reduce search speed large memory overhead end paper propose novel hyperplane hashing technique yield compact hash code key idea bilinear form propose hash function lead high collision probability exist hyperplane hash function use random projection increase performance propose learning base framework bilinear function directly learn data result short yet discriminative code also boost search performance random projection base solution large-scale active learning experiment carry two datasets one million sample demonstrate overall superiority propose approach
