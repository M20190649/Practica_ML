 sparse functional principal component analysis regularize variant principal component analysis especially sparse pca functional pca among useful tool analysis complex high-dimensional data many example massive data sparse functional smooth aspect may benefit regularization scheme capture form structure example neuro-imaging data brain 's response stimulus may restrict discrete region activation spatial sparsity exhibit smooth response within region propose unified approach regularize pca induce sparsity smoothness row column principal component framework generalizes much previous literature sparse functional two-way sparse two-way functional pca special case approach method permit flexible combination sparsity smoothness lead improvement feature selection signal recovery well interpretable pca factor demonstrate efficacy method simulate data neuroimaging example eeg data
