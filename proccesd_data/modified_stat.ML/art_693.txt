 cascade high dimensional histogram generative approach density estimation present tree- list- structured density estimation method high dimensional binary categorical data density estimation model high dimensional analogy variable bin width histogram leaf tree list density constant similar flat density within bin histogram histogram however easily visualize high dimension whereas model accuracy histogram fade dimension increase whereas model prior help generalization model sparse unlike high-dimensional histogram present three generative model first one allow user specify number desired leaf tree within bayesian prior second model allow user specify desired number branch within prior third model return list rather tree allow user specify desired number rule length rule within prior result indicate new approach yield good balance sparsity accuracy density estimate method task
