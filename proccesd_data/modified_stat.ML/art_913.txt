 independently interpretable lasso new regularizer sparse regression uncorrelated variable sparse regularization ell regularization quite powerful widely use strategy high dimensional learning problem effectiveness sparse regularization support practically theoretically several study however one big issue sparse regularization performance quite sensitive correlation feature ordinary ell regularization select variable correlate result deterioration generalization error also interpretability paper propose new regularization method independently interpretable lasso iilasso propose regularizer suppress select correlate variable thus active variable independently affect objective variable model hence interpret regression coefficient intuitively also improve performance avoid overfitting analyze theoretical property iilasso show propose method much advantageous sign recovery achieve almost minimax optimal convergence rate synthetic real data analysis also indicate effectiveness iilasso
