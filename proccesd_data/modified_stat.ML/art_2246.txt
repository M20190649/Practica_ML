 bayesian nonparametric approach image super-resolution super-resolution method form high-resolution image low-resolution image paper develop new bayesian nonparametric model super-resolution method use beta-bernoulli process learn set recur visual pattern call dictionary element data nonparametric number element find also determine data test result benchmark natural image compare several model research literature perform large-scale human evaluation experiment assess visual quality result first implementation use gibbs sampling approximate posterior however algorithm feasible large-scale data circumvent develop online variational bayes vb algorithm algorithm find high quality dictionary fraction time need gibbs sampler
