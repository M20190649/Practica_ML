 algorithm approximate minimization difference submodular function application extend work narasimhan bilmes minimize set function representable dierence submodular function similar new algorithm guarantee monotonically reduce objective function every step empirically theoretically show per-iteration cost algorithm much less algorithm use efficiently minimize dierence submodular function various combinatorial constraint problem previously address provide computational bound hardness result multiplicative inapproximability minimize dierence submodular function show however possible give worst-case additive bound provide polynomial time computable lower-bound minimum finally show number machine learn problem model minimize dierence submodular function experimentally show validity algorithm test problem feature selection submodular cost feature
