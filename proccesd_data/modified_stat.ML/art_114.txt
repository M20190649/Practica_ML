 lasso heteroscedasticity performance lasso well understood assumption standard linear model homoscedastic noise however several application standard model describe important feature data paper examine lasso performs non-standard model motivate medical imaging application application variance noise scale linearly expectation observation like heteroscedastic model noise term poisson-like model textit independent design matrix specifically paper study sign consistency lasso sparse poisson-like model addition study sufficient condition sign consistency lasso estimate paper also give necessary condition sign consistency set condition comparable result homoscedastic model show measure signal noise ratio large lasso perform well poisson-like data homoscedastic data simulation reveal lasso perform equally well term model selection performance poisson-like data homoscedastic data properly scale noise variance across range parameterizations take whole result suggest lasso robust poisson-like heteroscedastic noise
