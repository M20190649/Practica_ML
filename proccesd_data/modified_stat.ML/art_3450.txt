 find linear structure large datasets scalable canonical correlation analysis canonical correlation analysis cca widely use spectral technique find correlation structure multi-view datasets paper tackle problem large scale cca classical algorithm usually require compute product two huge matrix huge matrix decomposition computationally storage expensive recast cca novel perspective propose scalable memory efficient augment approximate gradient appgrad scheme find top k dimensional canonical subspace involve large matrix multiply thin matrix width k small matrix decomposition dimension k time k appgrad achieves optimal storage complexity k p p compare classical algorithm usually require p p space store two dense whiten matrix propose scheme naturally generalize stochastic optimization regime especially efficient huge datasets batch algorithm prohibitive online property stochastic appgrad also well suit streaming scenario data come sequentially best knowledge first stochastic algorithm cca experiment four real data set provide show effectiveness propose method
