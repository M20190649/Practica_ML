 generalized reparameterization gradient reparameterization gradient become widely use method obtain monte carlo gradient optimize variational objective however technique easily apply commonly used distribution beta gamma without approximation practical application reparameterization gradient fit gaussian distribution paper introduce generalized reparameterization gradient method extend reparameterization gradient wide class variational distribution generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformation latent variable lead transform distribution weakly depend variational parameter result new monte carlo gradient combine reparameterization gradient score function gradient demonstrate approach variational inference two complex probabilistic model generalized reparameterization effective even single sample variational distribution enough obtain low-variance gradient
