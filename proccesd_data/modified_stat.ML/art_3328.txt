 algorithm logarithmic sublinear regret constrain contextual bandit study contextual bandit budget time constraint refer constrain contextual bandits.the time budget constraint significantly complicate exploration exploitation tradeoff introduce complex coupling among context time.such coupling effect make difficult obtain oracle solution assume know statistic bandit gain insight first study unit-cost system known context distribution expect reward know develop approximation oracle refer adaptive-linear-programming alp achieve near-optimality require ordering expect reward highly desirable feature combine alp upper-confidence-bound ucb method general case expect reward unknown priori show propose ucb-alp algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except certain boundary case design algorithms obtain similar regret analysis result general system unknown context distribution heterogeneous cost best knowledge first work show achieve logarithmic regret constrained contextual bandit moreover work also shed light study computationally efficient algorithm general constrain contextual bandit
