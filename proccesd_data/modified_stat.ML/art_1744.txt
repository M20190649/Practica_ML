 metamodel-based importance sample structural reliability analysis structural reliability method aim compute probability failure system respect prescribed performance function modern engineering function usually resort run expensive-to-evaluate computational model e.g finite element model respect simulation method may require run use directly surrogate model quadratic response surface polynomial chaos expansion kriging build limited number run original model introduce substitute original model cope computational cost practice almost impossible quantify error make substitution though paper propose use kriging surrogate performance function mean build quasi-optimal importance sample density probability failure eventually obtain product augmented probability compute substitute meta-model original performance function correction term ensure bias estimation even meta-model fully accurate approach apply analytical finite element reliability problem prof efficient random variable
