 low-rank matrix tensor completion via adaptive sampling study low rank matrix tensor completion propose novel algorithm employ adaptive sampling scheme obtain strong performance guarantee algorithm exploit adaptivity identify entry highly informative learn column space matrix tensor consequently result hold even row space highly coherent contrast previous analysis absence noise show one exactly recover n time n matrix rank r merely omega n r log r matrix entry also show one recover order tensor use omega n r t- log r entry noisy recovery algorithm consistently estimate low rank matrix corrupt noise use omega n r textrm polylog n entry complement study simulation verify theory demonstrate scalability algorithm
