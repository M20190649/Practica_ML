 estimation initial condition kernel-based system identification recent development system identification bring attention regularize kernel-based method adopt recently introduce stable spline kernel prior information unknown process enforce reduce variance estimate thus make kernel-based method particularly attractive input-output data sample available case however influence system initial condition may significant impact output dynamic paper specifically address point propose three method deal estimation initial condition use different type information method consist various mixed maximum likelihood -- posteriori estimator estimate initial condition tune hyperparameters characterize stable spline kernel solve related optimization problem resort expectation-maximization method show solution attain iterate among simple update step numerical experiment show advantage term accuracy reconstruct system impulse response propose strategy compare kernel-based scheme account effect initial condition
