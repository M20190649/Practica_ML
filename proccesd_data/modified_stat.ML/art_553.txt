 scalable bayesian optimization use deep neural network bayesian optimization effective methodology global optimization function expensive evaluation rely query distribution function define relatively cheap surrogate model accurate model distribution function critical effectiveness approach typically fit use gaussian process gps however since gps scale cubically number observation challenge handle objective whose optimization require many evaluation massively parallelize optimization work explore use neural network alternative gps model distribution function show perform adaptive basis function regression neural network parametric form performs competitively state-of-the-art gp-based approach scale linearly number data rather cubically allow u achieve previously intractable degree parallelism apply large scale hyperparameter optimization rapidly find competitive model benchmark object recognition task use convolutional network image caption generation use neural language model
