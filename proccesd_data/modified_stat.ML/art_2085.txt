 transductive classification method mixed graph paper provide principled approach solve transductive classification problem involve similar graph edge tend connect node label dissimilar graph edge tend connect node oppose label exist method e.g. information regularization ir weighted vote relational neighbor classifier wvrn etc assume give graph similar graph extend ir wvrn method deal mixed graph evaluate propose extension several benchmark datasets well two real world datasets demonstrate usefulness idea
