 sensitivity analysis computationally expensive model use optimization objective-oriented surrogate approximation paper focus develop efficient sensitivity analysis method computationally expensive objective function f x case minimization perform computationally expensive mean evaluation take significant amount time therefore main goal use small number function evaluation f x infer sensitivity information different parameter correspondingly consider optimization procedure adaptive experimental design re-use available function evaluation initial design point establish surrogate model x call response surface sensitivity analysis perform x lieu f x furthermore propose new local multivariate sensitivity measure example around optimal solution high dimensional problem corresponding objective-oriented experimental design propose order make generated surrogate x well suitable accurate calculation propose specific local sensitivity quantity addition demonstrate good performance gaussian radial basis function interpolator kriging case relatively high dimensionality experimental design point numerical experiment demonstrate optimization procedure objective-oriented experimental design behavior much good classical latin hypercube design addition performance kriging good gaussian rbf especially case high dimensional problem
