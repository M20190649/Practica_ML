 forest floor visualization random forest propose novel methodology forest floor visualize interpret random forest rf model rf popular useful tool non-linear multi-variate classification regression yield good trade-off robustness low variance adaptiveness low bias direct interpretation rf model difficult explicit ensemble model hundred deep tree complex nonetheless possible visualize rf model fit mapping feature space prediction space hereby user first present overall geometrical shape model structure need one zoom local detail dimensional reduction projection use visualize high dimensional shape traditional method visualize rf model structure partial dependence plot achieve average multiple parallel projection suggest first use feature contribution method decompose tree split feature subsequently perform projection advantage forest floor partial dependence plot interaction mask average consequence possible locate interaction visualize give projection furthermore introduce goodness-of-visualization measure use colour gradient identify interaction out-of-bag cross validate variant feature contribution
