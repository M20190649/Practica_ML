 high dimensional nonlinear learn use local coordinate coding paper introduce new method semi-supervised learning high dimensional nonlinear manifold include phase unsupervised basis learning phase supervised function learning learned base provide set anchor point form local coordinate system data point x manifold locally approximate linear combination nearby anchor point linear weight offer local-coordinate coding x show high dimensional nonlinear function approximate global linear function respect cod scheme approximation quality ensure locality coding method turn difficult nonlinear learn problem simple global linear learning problem overcome drawback traditional local learning method work also give theoretical justification empirical success biologically-inspired model use sparse coding sensory data since local coding scheme must sufficiently sparse however sparsity always satisfy locality condition thus possibly lead suboptimal result property performance method empirically verify synthetic data handwritten digit classification object recognition task
