 latent-observed dissimilarity measure quantitatively assess relationship latent variable observed variable important understand develop generative model representation learning paper propose latent-observed dissimilarity lod evaluate dissimilarity probabilistic characteristic latent observe variable also define four essential type generative model different independence conditional independence configuration experiment use tractable real-world data show lod effectively capture difference model reflect capability high layer learning also show conditional independence latent variable give observe variable contributes improve transmission information characteristic low layer high layer
