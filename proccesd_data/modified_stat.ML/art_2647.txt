 deep multiple kernel learn deep learning method predominantly apply large artificial neural network despite state-of-the-art performance large network typically generalize well datasets limited sample size paper take different approach learn multiple layer kernel combine kernel layer optimize estimate support vector machine leave-one-out error rather dual objective function experiment variety datasets show layer successively increase performance base kernel
