 mathematical programming approach integrated multiple linear regression subset selection validation subset selection multiple linear regression aim construct regression model minimize error select small number explanatory variable model build various statistical test diagnostics conduct validate model determine whether regression assumption meet traditional approach require human decision step example user add remove variable satisfactory model obtain however trial-and-error strategy guarantee subset minimize error satisfy regression assumption find paper propose fully automate model building procedure multiple linear regression subset selection integrate model building validation base mathematical programming propose model minimize mean squared error ensure majority important regression assumption meet subset satisfy consider regression assumption model provide alternative subset satisfy assumption computational result show model yield well solution i.e. satisfy regression assumption compare benchmark model maintain similar explanatory power
