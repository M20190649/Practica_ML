 optimal regret analysis thompson sample stochastic multi-armed bandit problem multiple play discuss multiple-play multi-armed bandit mab problem several arm select round recently thompson sample t randomized algorithm bayesian spirit attract much attention empirically excellent performance reveal optimal regret bound standard single-play mab problem paper propose multiple-play thompson sample mp-ts algorithm extension t multiple-play mab problem discuss regret analysis prove mp-ts binary reward optimal regret upper bound match regret low bound provide anantharam et al therefore mp-ts first computationally efficient algorithm optimal regret set computer simulation also conduct compare mp-ts state-of-the-art algorithm also propose modification mp-ts show good empirical performance
