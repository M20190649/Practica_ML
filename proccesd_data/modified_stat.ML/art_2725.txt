 learn rate l q coefficient regularization learn gaussian kernel regularization well recognize powerful strategy improve performance learning machine l q regularization scheme q infty central use know different q lead different property deduced estimator say l regularization lead smooth estimator l regularization lead sparse estimator generalization capability l q regularization learn vary q paper study problem framework statistical learn theory show implement l q coefficient regularization scheme sample dependent hypothesis space associate gaussian kernel attain almost optimal learning rate q infty upper low bound learn rate l q regularization learn asymptotically identical q infty find tentatively reveals modeling context choice q might strong impact respect generalization capability perspective q arbitrarily specify specify merely generalization criterion like smoothness computational complexity sparsity etc..
