 deep neural network regularization structured output prediction deep neural network model powerful framework learn representation usually use learn relation x exploit regularity input x structure output prediction problem multi-dimensional structural relation often exist dimension motivation work learn output dependency may lie output data order improve prediction accuracy unfortunately feedforward network unable exploit relation output order overcome issue propose paper regularization scheme train neural network particular task use multi-task framework scheme aim incorporate learning output representation training process unsupervised fashion learn supervised mapping function x evaluate framework facial landmark detection problem typical structured output task show two public challenge datasets lfpw helen regularization scheme improve generalization deep neural network accelerate training use unlabeled data label-only data also explore show additional improvement result provide opensource implementation http github.com sbelharbi structured-output-ae framework
