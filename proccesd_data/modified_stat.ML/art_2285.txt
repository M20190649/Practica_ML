 supervise learn similarity function address problem general supervise learning data access indefinite similarity function data point exist work learn indefinite kernel concentrate solely binary multi-class classification problem propose model generic enough handle supervised learning task also subsume model previously propose classification give goodness criterion similarity function w.r.t give supervised learning task adapt well-known landmarking technique provide efficient algorithm supervised learning use good similarity function demonstrate effectiveness model three important super-vised learning problem real-valued regression b ordinal regression c ranking show method guarantee bound generalization error furthermore case real-valued regression give natural goodness definition use conjunction recent result sparse vector recovery guarantee sparse predictor bounded generalization error finally report result learn algorithm regression ordinal regression task use non-psd similarity function demonstrate effectiveness algorithm especially sparse landmark selection algorithm achieve significantly high accuracy baseline method offer reduced computational cost
