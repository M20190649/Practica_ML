 non-convex regularization remote sensing paper study effect different regularizers implication high dimensional image classification sparse linear unmixing although kernelization sparse method globally accepted solution process data high dimension present study impact form regularization use parametrization consider regularization via traditional squared sparsity-promoting norm well unconventional nonconvex regularizers p log sum penalty compare property advantage several classification linear unmixing task provide advice choice best regularizer problem hand finally also provide fully functional toolbox community
