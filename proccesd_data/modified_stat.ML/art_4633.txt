 fast nonlinear embeddings via structured matrix present new paradigm speed randomized computation several frequently use function machine learning particular paradigm apply improve computation kernel base random embeddings presented framework cover multivariate randomize function byproduct propose algorithmic approach also lead significant reduction space complexity method base careful recycling gaussian vector structured matrix share property fully random matrix quality propose structured approach follow combinatorial property graph encode correlation row structured matrix framework cover special case already know structured approach fast johnson-lindenstrauss transform much general since apply also highly nonlinear embeddings provide strong concentration result show quality presented paradigm
