 tight measurement bound exact recovery structured sparse signal standard compressive sensing result state exactly recover sparse signal r p one require s. log p measurement bound extremely useful practice often real world signal sparse also exhibit structure sparsity pattern focus group-structured pattern paper model group signal coefficient active inactive together group predefined particular set group active i.e. signal support must learn measurement show exploit knowledge group reduce number measurement require exact signal recovery derive universal bound number measurement need bound universal sense depend number group consideration particular group e.g. composition size extent overlap etc experiment show result hold variety overlap group configuration
