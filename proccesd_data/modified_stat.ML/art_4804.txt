 kernel-based generative learning distortion feature space paper present novel kernel-based generative classifier define distortion subspace use polynomial series expansion name kernel-distortion kd classifier iterative kernel selection algorithm develop steadily improve classification performance repeatedly remove add kernel experimental result character recognition application show propose generative classifier performs good many exist classifier also illustrate different recognition capability compare state-of-the-art discriminative classifier deep belief network recognition diversity indicate hybrid combination propose generative classifier discriminative classifier could improve classification performance two hybrid combination method cascade stack implement verify diversity improvement propose classifier
