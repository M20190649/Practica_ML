 robust ensemble cluster use probability trajectory although many successful ensemble clustering approach develop recent year still two limitation exist approach first mostly overlook issue uncertain link may mislead overall consensus process second generally lack ability incorporate global information refine local link address two limitation paper propose novel ensemble cluster approach base sparse graph representation probability trajectory analysis particular present elite neighbor selection strategy identify uncertain link locally adaptive threshold build sparse graph small number probably reliable link argue small number probably reliable link lead significantly good consensus result use graph link regardless reliability random walk process drive new transition probability matrix utilize explore global information graph derive novel dense similarity measure sparse graph analyze probability trajectory random walker base two consensus function propose experimental result multiple real-world datasets demonstrate effectiveness efficiency approach
