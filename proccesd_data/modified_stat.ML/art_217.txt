 model disease spectra case v control comparison classical approach study neurological disease however patient fall cleanly either group instead clinician typically find patient classify clearly progress disease state subject little say brain function basis analysis group difference describe intermediate brain function require model interpolate disease state choose gaussian process gp regression obtain continuous spectrum brain activation extract unknown disease progression profile model incorporate spatial distribution measure activation e.g correlation fmri trace input stimulus constitute ultra-high multi-variate gp regressors apply gps model fmri image phenotype across alzheimer 's disease ad behavioural measure e.g mmse ace etc score obtain prediction non-observed mmse ace value overall model confirm know reduction spatial extent activity response read versus false-font stimulation predictive uncertainty indicate worsen confidence interval behavioural score distance use gp training thus model indicate type patient behavioural score would need include training data improve model prediction
