 pursuit structured non-convex matrix factorization efficiently represent real world data succinct parsimonious manner central importance many field present generalized greedy pursuit framework allow u efficiently solve structured matrix factorization problem factor allow arbitrary set structured vector structure may include sparsity non-negativeness order combination thereof algorithm approximate give matrix linear combination rank- matrix factorize out product two vector atom desired structure non-convex subproblems obtain good rank- structure matrix atom employ analyze general atomic power method addition application prove linear convergence generalized pursuit variant hilbert space task approximation linear span arbitrary dictionary generalize omp useful beyond matrix problem experiment real datasets confirm efficiency also broad applicability framework practice
