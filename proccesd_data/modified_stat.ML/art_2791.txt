 gaussian process volatility model accurate prediction time-changing variance important task modeling financial data standard econometric model often limit assume rigid functional relationship variance moreover function parameter usually learn use maximum likelihood lead overfitting address problem introduce novel model time-changing variance use gaussian process gaussian process gp define distribution function allow u capture highly flexible functional relationship variance addition develop online algorithm perform inference algorithm two main advantage first take bayesian approach thereby avoid overfitting second much quick current offline inference procedure finally new model evaluate financial data show significant improvement predictive performance current standard model
