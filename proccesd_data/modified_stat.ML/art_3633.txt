 test relative similarity model selection generative model probabilistic generative model provide powerful framework represent data avoid expense manual annotation typically need discriminative approach model selection generative setting challenge however particularly likelihood easily accessible address issue introduce statistical test relative similarity use determine two model generates sample significantly closer real-world reference dataset interest use test statistic difference maximum mean discrepancy mmds reference dataset model dataset derive powerful low-variance test base joint asymptotic distribution mmds reference-model pair experiment deep generative model include variational auto-encoder generative moment match network test provide meaningful ranking model performance function parameter training setting
