 covariance-controlled adaptive langevin thermostat large-scale bayesian sample monte carlo sample bayesian posterior inference common approach use machine learning markov chain monte carlo procedure use often discrete-time analogue associate stochastic differential equation sdes sdes guarantee leave invariant required posterior distribution area current research address computational benefit stochastic gradient method setting exist technique rely estimate variance covariance subsampling error typically assume constant variance article propose covariance-controlled adaptive langevin thermostat effectively dissipate parameter-dependent noise maintain desired target distribution propose method achieve substantial speedup popular alternative scheme large-scale machine learning application
