 truncate variational expectation maximization derive novel variational expectation maximization approach base truncated posterior distribution truncate distribution proportional exact posterior within subset discrete state space equal zero otherwise treatment distribution subset variational parameter distinguish approach previous variational approach specific structure truncated distribution allow derive novel mathematically grounded result turn use formulate novel efficient algorithm optimize parameter probabilistic generative model centrally find variational low bound correspond truncate distribution give concise efficiently computable expression update equation model parameter remain standard form base finding show efficient easily applicable meta-algorithms formulate guarantee monotonic increase variational bound example application derive framework provide novel theoretical result learning procedure latent variable model well mixture model furthermore show truncated variation em naturally interpolate standard em full posterior em base maximum a-posteriori state map approach therefore regard generalization popular hard em approach towards similarly efficient method capture true posterior structure
