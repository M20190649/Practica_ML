 asymptotic accuracy distribution-based estimation latent variable hierarchical statistical model widely employ information science data engineering model consist two type variable observable variable represent give data latent variable unobservable label asymptotic analysis model play important role evaluate learning process result analysis apply theoretical also practical situation optimal model selection active learning many study generalization error measure prediction accuracy observable variable however accuracy estimate latent variable yet elucidate quantitative evaluation present paper formulate distribution-based function error estimation latent variable asymptotic behavior analyze maximum likelihood bayes method
