 discriminative feature via generalized eigenvectors represent example way compatible underlie classifier greatly enhance performance learning system paper investigate scalable technique induce discriminative feature take advantage simple second order structure data focus multiclass classification show feature extract generalized eigenvectors class conditional second moment lead classifier excellent empirical performance moreover feature attractive theoretical property induce representation invariant linear transformation input evaluate classifier build feature three different task obtain state art result
