 consistent algorithm multiclass classification reject option consider problem n -class classification n geq classifier choose abstain make prediction give cost say factor alpha cost misclassification design consistent algorithm n -class classification problem reject option main goal paper thereby extend generalize previously know result n show crammer-singer surrogate one v hinge loss albeit different predictor standard argmax yield consistent algorithm problem alpha frac interestingly design new convex surrogate also consistent problem alpha frac operate much low dimensional space log n oppose n also generalize three surrogate consistent alpha frac
