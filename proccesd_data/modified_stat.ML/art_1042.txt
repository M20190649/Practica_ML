 prior initial hyperparameters affect gaussian process regression model hyperparameters gaussian process regression gpr model specify kernel often estimate data via maximum marginal likelihood due non-convexity marginal likelihood respect hyperparameters optimization may converge global maximum common approach tackle issue use multiple start point randomly select specific prior distribution result choice prior distribution may play vital role predictability approach however exist little research literature study impact prior distribution hyperparameter estimation performance gpr paper provide first empirical study problem use simulate real data experiment consider different type prior initial value hyperparameters commonly use kernel investigate influence prior predictability gpr model result reveal kernel choose different prior initial hyperparameters significant impact performance gpr prediction despite estimate hyperparameters different true value case
