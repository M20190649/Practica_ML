 learn non-parametric basis independent model point query via low-rank method consider problem learn multi-ridge function form f x g ax point evaluation f. assume function f define l -ball r g twice continuously differentiable almost everywhere r k time rank k matrix k d. propose randomized polynomial-complexity sampling scheme estimate function theoretical development leverage recent technique low rank matrix recovery enable u derive polynomial time estimator function f along uniform approximation guarantee prove scheme also apply learn function form f x sum k g x provide f satisfies certain smoothness condition neighborhood around origin also characterize noise robustness scheme finally present numerical example illustrate theoretical bound action
