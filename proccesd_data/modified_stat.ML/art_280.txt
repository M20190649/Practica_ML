 statistical analysis latent generalize correlation matrix estimation transelliptical distribution correlation matrix play key role many multivariate method e.g. graphical model estimation factor analysis current state-of-the-art estimate large correlation matrix focus use pearson 's sample correlation matrix although pearson 's sample correlation matrix enjoy various good property gaussian model effective estimator face heavy-tailed distribution robust alternative han liu j. stat assoc advocate use transformed version kendall 's tau sample correlation matrix estimate high dimensional latent generalize correlation matrix transelliptical distribution family elliptical copula transelliptical family assume unspecified marginal monotone transformation data follow elliptical distribution paper study theoretical property kendall 's tau sample correlation matrix transformed version propose han liu j. stat assoc estimate population kendall 's tau correlation matrix latent pearson 's correlation matrix spectral restricted spectral norm regard spectral norm highlight role effective rank quantify rate convergence regard restrict spectral norm first time present sign sub-gaussian condition sufficient guarantee rank-based correlation matrix estimator attain fast rate convergence case need moment condition
