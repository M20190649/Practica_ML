 nonparametric variational inference variational method widely use approximate posterior inference however use typically limited family distribution enjoy particular conjugacy property circumvent limitation propose family variational approximation inspire nonparametric kernel density estimation location kernel bandwidth treat variational parameter optimize improve approximate low bound marginal likelihood data use multiple kernel allow approximation capture multiple mode posterior unlike variational approximation demonstrate efficacy nonparametric approximation hierarchical logistic regression model nonlinear matrix factorization model obtain predictive performance good good specialized variational method sample-based approximation method easy apply general graphical model standard variational method difficult derive
