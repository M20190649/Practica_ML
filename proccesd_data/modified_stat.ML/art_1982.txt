 multiple source adaptation renyi divergence paper present novel theoretical study general problem multiple source adaptation use notion renyi divergence result build previous work significantly broaden scope work several direction extend previous multiple source loss guarantee base distribution weight combination arbitrary target distribution p necessarily mixture source distribution analyze know unknown target distribution case prove low bound extend bound deal case learner receive approximate distribution source instead exact one show similar loss guarantee achieve depend divergence approximate true distribution also analyze case labeling function source domain somewhat different finally report result experiment artificial data set sentiment analysis task show performance benefit distribution weight combination quality bound base renyi divergence
