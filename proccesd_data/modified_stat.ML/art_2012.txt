 fast cross-validation via sequential test increase size today 's data set find right parameter configuration model selection via cross-validation extremely time-consuming task paper propose improved cross-validation procedure use nonparametric test couple sequential analysis determine best parameter set linearly increase subset data eliminate underperforming candidate quickly keep promising candidate long possible method speed computation preserve capability full cross-validation theoretical consideration underline statistical power procedure experimental evaluation show method reduce computation time factor compare full cross-validation negligible impact accuracy
