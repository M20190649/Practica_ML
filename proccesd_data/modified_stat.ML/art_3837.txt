 molecular graph convolution move beyond fingerprint molecular fingerprint encode structural information workhorse cheminformatics machine learning drug discovery application however fingerprint representation necessarily emphasize particular aspect molecular structure ignore others rather allow model make data-driven decision describe molecular graph convolution machine learning architecture learn undirected graph specifically small molecule graph convolution use simple encoding molecular graph -- -atoms bond distance etc. -- -which allow model take great advantage information graph structure although graph convolution outperform fingerprint-based method along graph-based method represent new paradigm ligand-based virtual screening exciting opportunity future improvement
