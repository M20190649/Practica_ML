 gain loss fundamentally different regret minimization sparse case demonstrate classical non-stochastic regret minimization problem decision gain loss respectively maximize minimize fundamentally different indeed consider additional sparsity assumption stage decision incur nonzero outcome derive optimal regret bound different order specifically gain obtain optimal regret guarantee stage order sqrt log classical dependency dimension replace sparsity size loss provide match upper low bound order sqrt t log decrease eventually also study bandit setting obtain upper bound order sqrt t log outcome loss bound prove optimal logarithmic factor sqrt log
