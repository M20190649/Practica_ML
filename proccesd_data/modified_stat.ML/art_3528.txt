 exponential family matrix completion structural constraint consider matrix completion problem recover structured matrix noisy partial measurement recent work propose tractable estimator strong statistical guarantee case underlying matrix low -- rank measurement consist subset either exact individual entry entry perturb additive gaussian noise thus implicitly suit thin -- tail continuous data arguably common application matrix completion require estimator heterogeneous data -- type skewed -- continuous count binary etc. b heterogeneous noise model beyond gaussian capture varied uncertainty measurement c heterogeneous structural constraint beyond low -- rank block -- sparsity superposition structure low -- rank plus elementwise sparseness among others paper provide vastly unify framework generalized matrix completion consider matrix completion set wherein matrix entry sample member rich family exponential family distribution impose general structural constraint underlying matrix capture general regularizer mathcal r propose simple convex regularize -- estimator generalized framework provide unified novel statistical analysis general class estimator finally corroborate theoretical result simulated datasets
