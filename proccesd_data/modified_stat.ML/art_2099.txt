 consistent multilabel rank univariate loss consider problem rank loss minimization setting multilabel classification usually tackle mean convex surrogate loss define pair label recently approach put question negative result show commonly use pairwise surrogate loss exponential logistic loss inconsistent paper show positive result arguably surprising light previous one simpler univariate variant exponential logistic surrogate i.e. define single label consistent rank loss minimization instead directly prove convergence give much strong result derive regret bound convergence rate proposed loss suggest efficient scalable algorithm test experimentally
