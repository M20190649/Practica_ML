 novel bernstein-like concentration inequality miss mass concern obtain novel concentration inequality miss mass i.e total probability mass outcome observe sample derive first time distribution-free bernstein-like deviation bound sublinear exponent deviation size miss mass also improve result mcallester ortiz andberend kontorovich small deviation interesting case learn theory know majority standard inequality directly use analyze heterogeneous sum i.e sum whose term large difference magnitude generic intuitive approach show heterogeneity issue introduce mcallester ortiz resolvable least case miss mass via regulate term use novel thresholding technique
