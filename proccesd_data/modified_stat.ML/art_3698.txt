 gauss quadrature matrix inverse form application present framework accelerate spectrum machine learn algorithm require computation bilinear inverse form u top u positive definite matrix u give vector framework build gauss-type quadrature easily scale large sparse matrix allow retrospective computation low upper bound u top u turn accelerate several algorithm prove bound tighten iteratively converge linear geometric rate knowledge first work demonstrate key property gauss-type quadrature classical deeply studied topic illustrate empirical consequence result use quadrature accelerate machine learn task involve determinantal point process submodular optimization observe tremendous speedup several instance
