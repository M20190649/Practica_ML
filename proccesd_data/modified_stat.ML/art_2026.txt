 cumulative distribution network derivative-sum-product algorithm introduce new type graphical model call cumulative distribution network cdn express joint cumulative distribution product local function local function view provide evidence possible ordering ranking variable interestingly find conditional independence property cdns quite different graphical model also describe messagepassing algorithm efficiently compute conditional cumulative distribution due unique independence property cdn message general one-to-one correspondence message exchange standard algorithm belief propagation demonstrate application cdns structured ranking learn use previously-studied multi-player gaming dataset
