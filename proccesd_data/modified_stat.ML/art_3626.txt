 semi-supervised tuning temporal coherence recent work demonstrate usefulness temporal coherence regularize supervised training learn invariant feature deep architecture particular enforce smooth output change present temporally-closed frame video sequence prove effective strategy paper prove efficacy temporal coherence semi-supervised incremental tuning show deep architecture mildly train supervised manner progressively improve classification accuracy expose video sequence unlabeled data extent case semi-supervised tuning allow improve classification accuracy approach supervised one somewhat surprising number control experiment point fundamental role temporal coherence
