 unsupervised learn truncated gaussian graphical model gaussian graphical model ggms widely use statistical modeling ease inference ubiquitous use normal distribution practical approximation however also know limited modeling ability due gaussian assumption paper introduce novel variant ggms relax gaussian restriction yet admits efficient inference specifically impose bipartite structure ggm govern hidden variable truncated normal distribution nonlinearity model reveal connection rectify linear unit relu neural network meanwhile thanks bipartite structure appeal property truncated normal able train model efficiently use contrastive divergence consider three output construct account real-valued binary count data extend model deep construction show deep model use unsupervised pre-training rectifier neural network extensive experimental result provide validate propose model demonstrate superiority compete model
