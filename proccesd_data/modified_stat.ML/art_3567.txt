 improve estimation class prior probability unlabeled data work classification literature show compute classification function one need know class membership observation training set unlabeled observation still provide information marginal distribution feature set thus contribute increase classification accuracy future observation present paper show scheme also use estimation class prior probability would useful application difficult expensive determine class membership parametric nonparametric estimator develop asymptotic distribution estimator derive prove use unlabeled observation reduce asymptotic variance methodology also extend estimation subclass probability
