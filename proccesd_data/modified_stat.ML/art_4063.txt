 boost variational inference variational inference vi provide fast approximation bayesian posterior part formulate posterior approximation optimization problem find close distribution exact posterior family distribution practical reason family distribution vi usually constrain include exact posterior even limit point thus matter long vi run result approximation approach exact posterior propose instead consider flexible approximate family consist possible finite mixture parametric base distribution e.g. gaussian efficient inference borrow idea gradient boost develop algorithm call boost variational inference bvi bvi iteratively improve current approximation mix new component base distribution family thereby yield progressively accurate posterior approximation computing time spend unlike number common vi variant include mean-field vi bvi able capture multimodality general posterior covariance nonstandard posterior shape
