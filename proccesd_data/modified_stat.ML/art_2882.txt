 online optimization large-scale max-norm regularization max-norm regularizer extensively study last decade promote effective low-rank estimation underlying data however max-norm regularize problem typically formulate solve batch manner prevent process big data due possible memory budget paper hence propose online algorithm scalable large-scale setting particularly consider matrix decomposition problem example although simple variant algorithm analysis adapt important problem matrix completion crucial technique implementation reformulate max-norm equivalent matrix factorization form factor consist possibly overcomplete basis component coefficient one way may maintain basis component memory optimize coefficient sample alternatively since memory footprint basis component independent sample size algorithm appeal manipulate large collection sample prove sequence solution i.e. basis component produce algorithm converge stationary point expected loss function asymptotically numerical study demonstrate encouraging result efficacy robustness algorithm compare widely use nuclear norm solver
