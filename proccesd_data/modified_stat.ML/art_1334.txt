 expectation propagation t-exponential family use q-algebra exponential family distribution highly useful machine learning since calculation perform efficiently natural parameter exponential family recently extend t-exponential family contain student-t distribution family member thus allow u handle noisy data well however since t-exponential family deny deformed exponential derive efficient learning algorithm t-exponential family expectation propagation ep paper borrow mathematical tool q-algebra statistical physic show pseudo additivity distribution allow u perform calculation t-exponential family distribution natural parameter develop expectation propagation ep algorithm t-exponential family provide deterministic approximation posterior predictive distribution simple moment matching finally apply propose ep algorithm bayes point machine student-t process classication demonstrate performance numerically
