 introduction tensor decomposition application machine learning tensor multidimensional array numerical value therefore generalize matrix multiple dimension tensor first emerge psychometrics community text th century since spread numerous discipline include machine learning tensor decomposition especially beneficial unsupervised learning setting gain popularity sub-disciplines like temporal multi-relational data analysis scope paper give broad overview tensor decomposition use machine learning part go introduce basic tensor concept discuss tensor consider rigid matrix respect uniqueness decomposition explain important factorization algorithm property provide concrete example tensor decomposition application machine learning conduct case study tensor-based estimation mixture model talk current state research provide reference available software library
