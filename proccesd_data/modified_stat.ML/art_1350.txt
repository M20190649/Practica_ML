 subspace cluster miss corrupt data give full partial information collection point lie close union several subspace subspace cluster refers process cluster point accord subspace identify subspace one popular approach sparse subspace cluster ssc represent sample weighted combination sample weight minimal ell norm use learned weight cluster sample ssc stable setting sample contaminate relatively small amount noise however significant amount additive noise considerable number entry miss theoretical guarantee scarce paper study robust variant ssc establish cluster guarantee presence corrupt miss data give explicit bound amount noise miss data algorithm tolerate deterministic setting random generative model notably approach provide guarantee high tolerance noise miss data exist analysis method design result hold even know location miss data e.g. presence-only data
