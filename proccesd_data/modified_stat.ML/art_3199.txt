 feature selection redundancy-complementariness dispersion feature selection attract significant attention data mining machine learning past decade many exist feature selection method eliminate redundancy measure pairwise inter-correlation feature whereas complementariness feature high inter-correlation among two feature ignore study modification item concern complementariness feature introduce evaluation criterion feature additionally order identify interference effect already-selected false positive fps redundancy-complementariness dispersion also take account adjust measurement pairwise inter-correlation feature illustrate effectiveness propose method classification experiment apply four frequently use classifier ten datasets classification result verify superiority propose method compare five representative feature selection method
