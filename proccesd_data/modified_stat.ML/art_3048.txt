 active regression stratification propose new active learning algorithm parametric linear regression random design provide finite sample convergence guarantee general distribution misspecified model first active learner setting provably improve passive learning unlike learn setting classification regression passive learning rate epsilon general improve upon nonetheless so-called constant rate convergence characterize distribution-dependent risk improve many case give distribution achieve optimal risk require prior knowledge distribution follow stratification technique advocate monte-carlo function integration active learner approach optimal risk use piecewise constant approximation
