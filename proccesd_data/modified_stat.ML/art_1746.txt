 missforest nonparametric miss value imputation mixed-type data modern data acquisition base high-throughput technology often face problem miss data algorithm commonly use analysis large-scale data often depend complete set miss value imputation offer solution problem however majority available imputation method restrict one type variable continuous categorical mixed-type data different type usually handle separately therefore method ignore possible relation variable type propose nonparametric method cope different type variable simultaneously compare several state art method imputation miss value propose evaluate iterative imputation method missforest base random forest average many unpruned classification regression tree random forest intrinsically constitute multiple imputation scheme use built-in out-of-bag error estimate random forest able estimate imputation error without need test set evaluation perform multiple data set come diverse selection biological field artificially introduce miss value range show missforest successfully handle miss value particularly data set include different type variable comparative study missforest outperform method imputation especially data setting complex interaction nonlinear relation suspect out-of-bag imputation error estimate missforest prove adequate setting additionally missforest exhibit attractive computational efficiency cope high-dimensional data
