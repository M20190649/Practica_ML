 circulant binary embed binary embedding high-dimensional data require long code preserve discriminative power input space traditional binary coding method often suffer high computation storage cost scenario address problem propose circulant binary embedding cbe generate binary code project data circulant matrix circulant structure enable use fast fourier transformation speed computation compare method use unstructured matrix propose method improve time complexity mathcal mathcal log space complexity mathcal mathcal input dimensionality also propose novel time-frequency alternate optimization learn data-dependent circulant projection alternatively minimize objective original fourier domain show extensive experiment propose approach give much good performance state-of-the-art approach fixed time provide much fast computation performance degradation fixed number bit
