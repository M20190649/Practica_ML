 roll-back hamiltonian monte carlo propose new framework hamiltonian monte carlo hmc truncated probability distribution smooth underlying density function traditional hmc require compute gradient potential function associate target distribution therefore perform full power truncated distribution due lack continuity differentiability framework introduce sharp sigmoid factor density function approximate probability drop truncation boundary target potential function approximate new potential smoothly extend entire sample space hmc perform approximate potential method easy implement applies wide range problem also achieve comparable computational efficiency various sample task compare baseline method rbhmc also give rise new approach bayesian inference constrained space
