 hierarchical multi-output near neighbor model multi-output dependence learn multi-output dependence mod learning generalization standard classification problem allow multiple output dependent primary issue arise context mod learning give input pattern multiple correct output pattern change learn task function approximation relation approximation previous algorithm consider problem thus readily apply mod problem perform mod learning introduce hierarchical multi-output near neighbor model hmonn employ basic learning model output modified nearest neighbor approach refine initial result
