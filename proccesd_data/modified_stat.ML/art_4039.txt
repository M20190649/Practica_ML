 anneal gaussian relu new sampling strategy leaky-relu rbm restrict boltzmann machine rbm bipartite graphical model use building block energy-based deep generative model due numerical stability quantifiability likelihood rbm commonly use bernoulli unit consider alternative member exponential family rbm leaky rectify linear unit -- call leaky rbm first study joint marginal distribution leaky rbm different leakiness provide u important insight connect leaky rbm model truncated gaussian distribution connection lead u simple yet efficient method sample model basic idea anneal leakiness rather energy -- i.e. start fully gaussian linear unit gradually decrease leakiness iteration serve alternative annealing temperature parameter enable numerical estimation likelihood efficient accurate commonly use anneal importance sample ai demonstrate propose sampling algorithm enjoy faster mix property contrastive divergence algorithm benefit training without additional computational cost
