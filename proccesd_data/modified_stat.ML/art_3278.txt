 regularize minimax conditional entropy crowdsourcing rapidly increase interest crowdsourcing data labeling crowdsourcing large number label often quickly gather low cost however label provide crowdsourcing worker usually high quality paper propose minimax conditional entropy principle infer ground truth noisy crowdsourced label principle derive unique probabilistic label model jointly parameterized worker ability item difficulty also propose objective measurement principle show method method satisfy objective measurement principle validate method variety real crowdsourcing datasets binary multiclass ordinal label
