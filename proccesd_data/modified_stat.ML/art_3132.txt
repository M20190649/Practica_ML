 efficient penalty search multiple changepoint problem multiple changepoint setting various search method propose involve optimise either constrained penalised cost function possible number location changepoints use dynamic programming method typically computationally intensive recent work penalised optimisation setting focus develop pruning-based approach give improved computational cost certain condition linear number data point approach naturally require specification penalty avoid over-fitting work undertake identify appropriate penalty choice data generate process known distributional form many application model assume data correct penalty choice always appropriate consequently desirable approach enable u compare segmentation different choice penalty end present method obtain optimal changepoint segmentation data sequence penalty value across continuous range permit evaluation various segmentation identify suitably parsimonious penalty choice computational complexity approach linear number data point linear difference number changepoints optimal segmentation small large penalty value order magnitude faster alternative approach find optimal segmentation range number changepoints
