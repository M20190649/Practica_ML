 predict evolution stationary graph signal emerge way tackle dimensionality issue arise modeling multivariate process assume inherent data structure capture graph nevertheless though state-of-the-art graph-based method successful many learn task consider time-evolving signal thus suitable prediction base recently introduce joint stationarity framework time-vertex process letter consider multivariate model exploit graph topology facilitate prediction result method yield similar accuracy joint time-graph mean-squared error estimator low complexity outperforms purely time-based method
