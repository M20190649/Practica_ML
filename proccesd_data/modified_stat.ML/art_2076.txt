 convergent propagation algorithm via orient tree inference problem graphical model often approximate cast constrain optimization problem message pass algorithm belief propagation previously suggest method solve optimization problem however convergence guarantee algorithm algorithm therefore guarantee solve corresponding optimization problem present oriented tree decomposition algorithm guarantee converge global optimum tree-reweighted trw variational problem algorithm perform local update convex dual trw problem unconstrained generalized geometric program primal update also local correspond orient reparametrization operation leave distribution intact
