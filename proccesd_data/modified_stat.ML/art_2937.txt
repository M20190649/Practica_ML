 dynamic feature scale online learning binary classifier scale feature value important step numerous machine learn task different feature different value range form feature scaling often require order learn accurate classifier however feature scaling conduct preprocessing task prior learn problematic online setting two reason first might possible accurately determine value range feature initial stage learn observe number training instance second distribution data change time render obsolete feature scaling perform pre-processing step propose simple effective method dynamically scale feature train time thereby quickly adapt change data stream compare propose dynamic feature scale method complex method estimate scale parameter use several benchmark datasets binary classification propose feature scale method consistently outperform complex method benchmark datasets improve classification accuracy state-of-the-art online binary classifier algorithm
