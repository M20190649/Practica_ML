 evaluation protein-protein interaction predictor noisy partially label data set protein-protein interaction ppi prediction important problem machine learning computational biology however data set training evaluation purpose instance accurately label instead available instance positive class possibly noisy label instance negative class non-availability negative class data typically handle observation randomly choose protein-pairs nearly chance negative class protein pair expect expect interacting pair paper focus problem non-availability accurately label test data set domain protein-protein interaction ppi prediction may lead biased evaluation result first show acknowledge inherent skew interactome i.e rare occurrence positive instance lead over-estimated accuracy predictor show belief positive interaction rare category sample random pair protein exclude know interacting protein set negative testing data set could lead under-estimated evaluation result formalize two problem validate claim base formalization propose balance method cancel over-estimation under-estimation finally experiment validate theoretical aspect show balance evaluation could evaluate exact performance without availability golden standard data set
