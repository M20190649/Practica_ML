 gaussian mixture model gaussian process latent variable model density modeling notoriously difficult high dimensional data one approach problem search low dimensional manifold capture main characteristic data recently gaussian process latent variable model gplvm successfully use find low dimensional manifold variety complex data gplvm consist set point low dimensional latent space stochastic map observed space show interpret density model observed space however gplvm train density model therefore yield bad density estimate propose new training strategy obtain improved generalisation performance good density estimate comparative evaluation several benchmark data set
