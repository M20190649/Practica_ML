 towards faster rate oracle property low-rank matrix estimation present unified framework low-rank matrix estimation nonconvex penalty first prove propose estimator attain fast statistical rate traditional low-rank matrix estimator nuclear norm penalty moreover rigorously show certain condition magnitude nonzero singular value propose estimator enjoy oracle property i.e. exactly recover true rank matrix besides attain faster rate far know first work establish theory low-rank matrix estimation nonconvex penalty confirm advantage nonconvex penalty matrix completion numerical experiment synthetic real world datasets corroborate theory
