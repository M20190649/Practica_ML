 bayesian nonparametric modeling heterogeneous group censor data datasets contain large sample time-to-event data arise several small heterogeneous group commonly encounter statistic present problem pool directly due heterogeneity analyze individually small sample size bayesian nonparametric model approach use model datasets give ability flexibly share information across group paper compare three popular bayesian nonparametric method model survival function heterogeneous group specifically first compare model accuracy dirichlet process hierarchical dirichlet process nested dirichlet process simulated datasets different size group survival curve differ shape expectation compare model real-world injury dataset
