 g-ama sparse gaussian graphical model estimation via alternate minimization several method recently propose estimate sparse gaussian graphical model use ell regularization inverse covariance matrix despite recent advance contemporary application require method even faster order handle ill-conditioned high dimensional modern day datasets paper propose new method g-ama solve sparse inverse covariance estimation problem use alternate minimization algorithm ama effectively work proximal gradient algorithm dual problem approach several novel advantage exist method first demonstrate g-ama faster previous best algorithm many order magnitude thus ideal approach modern high throughput application second global linear convergence g-ama demonstrate rigorously underscore good theoretical property third dual algorithm operate covariance matrix thus easily facilitate incorporate additional constraint pairwise marginal relationship feature pair base domain specific knowledge estimate sparse inverse covariance matrix also illustrate incorporate constraint bivariate correlation incorporate equality equisparsity linear constraint individual inverse covariance element fourth also show g-ama well adept handle extremely ill-conditioned problem often case real data methodology demonstrate simulate real datasets illustrate superior performance recently propose method
