 maximum margin bayesian network consider problem learn bayesian network classifier maximize marginover set classification variable find problem hard bayesian network undirected graphical model like maximum margin markov network main difficulty parameter bayesian network must satisfy additional normalization constraint undirected graphical model need respect additional constraint complicate optimization task nevertheless derive effective training algorithm solve maximum margin training problem range bayesian network topology converges approximate solution arbitrary network topology experimental result show method demonstrate improved generalization performance markov network directed graphical structure encode relevant knowledge practice training technique allow one combine prior knowledge express directed causal model state art discriminative learning method
