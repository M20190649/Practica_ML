 stochastic search observable state variable paper study convex stochastic search problem noisy objective function value observe decision make many stochastic search problem whose behavior depend exogenous state variable affect shape objective function currently general purpose algorithm solve class problem use nonparametric density estimation take observation joint state-outcome distribution use infer optimal decision give query state propose two solution method depend problem characteristic function-based gradient-based optimization examine two weight scheme kernel-based weight dirichlet process-based weight use solution method weight solution method test synthetic multi-product newsvendor problem hour-ahead wind commitment problem result show case dirichlet process weight offer substantial benefit kernel base weight generally nonparametric estimation method provide good solution otherwise intractable problem
