 generalization property learn random feature study generalization property ridge regression random feature statistical learning framework show first time sqrt n learn bound achieve sqrt n log n random feature rather n suggest previous result prove faster learn rate show might require random feature unless sample accord possibly problem dependent distribution result shed light statistical computational trade-off large scale kernelized learning show potential effectiveness random feature reduce computational complexity keep optimal generalization property
