 unsupervised joint alignment cluster use bayesian nonparametrics joint alignment collection function process independently transform function appear similar typically unsupervised alignment algorithm fail present complex data set arise multiple modality make restrictive assumption form function transformation limit generality present transformed bayesian infinite mixture model simultaneously align cluster data set model associate learning scheme offer two key advantage optimal number cluster determine data-driven fashion use dirichlet process prior accommodate transformation function parameterized continuous parameter vector result applicable wide range data type transformation function present positive result synthetic two-dimensional data set one-dimensional curve various image data set show large improvement previous work discuss several variation model conclude direction future work
