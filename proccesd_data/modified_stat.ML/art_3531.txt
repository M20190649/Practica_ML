 zero-shot learning via semantic similarity embed paper consider version zero-shot learning problem see class source target domain data provide goal test-time accurately predict class label unseen target domain instance base revealed source domain side information eg attribute unseen class method base view source target data mixture see class proportion postulate mixture pattern similar two instance belong unseen class perspective lead u learn source target embed function map arbitrary source target domain data semantic space similarity readily measure develop max-margin framework learn similarity function jointly optimize parameter mean cross validation test result compel lead significant improvement term accuracy benchmark datasets zero-shot recognition
