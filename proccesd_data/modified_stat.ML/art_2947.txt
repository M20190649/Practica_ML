 matrix completion graph problem find miss value matrix give entry call matrix completion gather lot attention recent year although problem standard low rank assumption np-hard cand e recht show exactly relax number observed entry sufficiently large work introduce novel matrix completion model make use proximity information row column assume form community assumption make sense several real-world problem like recommender system community people share preference product form cluster receive similar rating main goal thus find low-rank solution structure proximity row column encode graph borrow idea manifold learn constrain solution smooth graph order implicitly force row column proximity matrix recovery model formulate convex non-smooth optimization problem well-posed iterative scheme provide study evaluate propose matrix completion synthetic real data show propose structure low-rank recovery model outperform standard matrix completion model many situation
