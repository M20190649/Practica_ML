 batch bayesian optimization via local penalization popularity bayesian optimization method efficient exploration parameter space lead series paper apply gaussian process surrogate optimization function however propose approach allow exploration parameter space occur sequentially often desirable simultaneously propose batch parameter value explore particularly case large parallel processing facility available facility could computational physical facet process optimize e.g biological experiment many experimental set ups allow several sample simultaneously process batch method however require modeling interaction evaluation batch expensive complex scenario investigate simple heuristic base estimate lipschitz constant capture important aspect interaction i.e local repulsion negligible computational overhead result algorithm compare well run time much elaborate alternative approach assume function interest f lipschitz continuous function wrap-loop around acquisition function use collect batch point certain size minimize non-parallelizable computational effort speed-up method respect previous approach significant set computationally expensive experiment
