 strictly proper kernel score rule divergence application kernel two-sample hypothesis test study strictly proper score rule reproducing kernel hilbert space propose general kernel scoring rule associate kernel divergence consider condition kernel score strictly proper demonstrate kernel score include maximum mean discrepancy special case also consider connection kernel score minimum risk proper loss function show kernel score incorporate information pertaining project embed distribution compare maximum mean discrepancy finally show integrate information provide different kernel divergence propose bhattacharyya kernel divergence use one-class classifier improved two-sample hypothesis test result
