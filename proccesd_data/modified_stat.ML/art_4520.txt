 generalization bound learn linear polygonal quadratic conic side knowledge paper consider supervised learning set side knowledge provide label unlabeled example side knowledge effect reduce hypothesis space lead tighter generalization bound thus possibly good generalization consider several type side knowledge first lead linear polygonal constraint hypothesis space second leading quadratic constraint last leading conic constraint show different type domain knowledge lead directly kind side knowledge prove bound complexity measure hypothesis space quadratic conic side knowledge show bound tight specific sense quadratic case
