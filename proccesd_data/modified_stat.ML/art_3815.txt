 variational inference monte carlo objective recent progress deep latent variable model largely drive development flexible scalable variational inference method variational training type involve maximize low bound log-likelihood use sample variational posterior compute required gradient recently burda et al derive tight low bound use multi-sample importance sample estimate likelihood show optimize yield model use capacity achieve high likelihood development show importance multi-sample objective explain success several related approach extend multi-sample approach discrete latent variable analyze difficulty encounter estimate gradient involve develop first unbiased gradient estimator design importance-sampled objective evaluate train generative structured output prediction model result estimator base low-variance per-sample learning signal simple effective nvil estimator propose single-sample variational objective competitive currently use bias estimator
