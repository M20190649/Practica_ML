 supervise classification use sparse fisher 's lda well know supervised classification set number feature small number observation fisher 's linear discriminant rule asymptotically bayes however numerous modern application classification need high-dimensional setting naive implementation fisher 's rule case fail provide good result sample covariance matrix singular moreover construct classifier rely feature interpretation result challenge goal provide robust classification rely small subset important feature account underlying correlation structure apply lasso-type penalty discriminant vector ensure sparsity solution use shrinkage type estimator covariance matrix result optimization problem solve use iterative coordinate ascent algorithm furthermore analyze effect nonconvexity sparsity level solution highlight difference penalize constrained version problem simulation result show propose method perform favorably comparison alternative method use classify leukemia patient base dna methylation feature
