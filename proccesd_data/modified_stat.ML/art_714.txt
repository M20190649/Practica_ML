 kernel two-sample test brain network clinical neuroscientific study systematic difference two population brain network investigate order characterize mental disease process network usually represent graph build neuroimaging data study mean graph analysis method typical machine learn approach study brain graph create classifier test ability discriminate two population contrast approach work propose directly test whether two population graph different use kernel two-sample test ktst without create intermediate classifier claim general two approach provide similar result ktst require much less computation additionally regime low sample size claim ktst low frequency type ii error classification approach besides provide algorithmic consideration support claim show strong evidence experiment one simulation
