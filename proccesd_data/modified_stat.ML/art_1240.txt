 train gaussian mixture model scale via coresets train statistical mixture model massive data set work show construct coresets mixture gaussians coreset weighted subset data guarantee model fit coreset also provide good fit original data set show perhaps surprisingly gaussian mixture admit coresets size polynomial dimension number mixture component independent data set size hence one harness computationally intensive algorithm compute good approximation significantly small data set importantly coresets efficiently construct distribute streaming setting impose restriction data generate process result rely novel reduction statistical estimation problem computational geometry new combinatorial complexity result mixture gaussians empirical evaluation several real-world datasets suggest coreset-based approach enable significant reduction training-time negligible approximation error
