 tight convex upper bound likelihood finite mixture likelihood function finite mixture model non-convex function multiple local maximum commonly use iterative algorithm em converge different solution depend initial condition paper ask possible assess far global maximum likelihood since likelihood finite mixture model grow unboundedly center gaussian single datapoint shrink covariance constrain problem assume parameter individual model member large discrete set e.g estimate mixture two gaussians mean variance gaussians member set million possible mean variance setting show simple upper bound likelihood compute use convex optimization analyze condition bound guarantee tight bound use assess quality solution find em final result project discrete set mixture estimation algorithm dataset method allow u find finite mixture model together dataset-specific bound far likelihood mixture global optimum likelihood
