 bayesian efficient multiple kernel learn multiple kernel learn algorithm propose combine kernel order obtain good similarity measure integrate feature representation come different data source previous research method focus computational efficiency issue however still feasible combine many kernel use exist bayesian approach due high time complexity propose fully conjugate bayesian formulation derive deterministic variational approximation allow u combine hundred thousand kernel efficiently briefly explain propose method extend multiclass learning semi-supervised learning experiment large number kernel benchmark data set show inference method quite fast require less minute one bioinformatics three image recognition data set method outperform previously report result good generalization performance
