 cluster partially observe graph via convex optimization paper consider problem cluster partially observe unweighted graph -- -i.e. one node pair know edge others know edge remain know whether edge want organize node disjoint cluster relatively dense observed connectivity within cluster sparse across cluster take novel yet natural approach problem focus find clustering minimize number disagreement -- -i.e. sum number observed miss edge within cluster observe present edge across cluster algorithm us convex optimization basis reduction disagreement minimization problem recover unknown low-rank matrix unknown sparse matrix partially observe sum evaluate performance algorithm classical planted partition stochastic block model main theorem provide sufficient condition success algorithm function minimum cluster size edge density observation probability particular result characterize tradeoff observation probability edge density gap constant number cluster equal size result optimal logarithmic factor
