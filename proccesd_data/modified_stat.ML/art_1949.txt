 correct kriging update formula batch-sequential data assimilation recently lot effort pay efficient computation kriging predictor observation assimilate sequentially particular kriging update formula enable significant computational saving derive barnes watson gao et al emery take advantage previous kriging mean variance calculation help avoid costly n time n matrix inversion add one observation n already available one addition traditional update formula take account single new observation emery also propose formula batch-sequential case i.e r new observation simultaneously assimilate however kriging variance covariance formula give without proof emery batch-sequential case correct paper fix issue establish correct expression updated kriging variance covariance assimilate several observation parallel
