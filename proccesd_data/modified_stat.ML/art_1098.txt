 anomaly detection localisation use mixed graphical model propose method perform anomaly detection localisation within heterogeneous data use pairwise undirected mixed graphical model data mixture categorical quantitative variable model learn dataset suppose contain anomaly use model temporal data potentially data stream use version two-sided cusum algorithm propose decision statistic base conditional likelihood ratio compute variable give others result show function allow detect anomaly variable variable thus localise variable involve anomaly precisely univariate method base simple marginals
