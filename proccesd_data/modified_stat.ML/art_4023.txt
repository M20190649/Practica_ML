 nonstop nonstationary online prediction method time series present online prediction method time series let u explicitly handle nonstationary artifact e.g trend seasonality present real time series specifically show apply appropriate transformation time series prediction lead improved theoretical empirical prediction performance moreover since transformation usually unknown employ learning expert set develop fully online method nonstop-nonstationary online prediction predict nonstationary time series framework allow seasonality trend univariate time series cointegration multivariate time series algorithm regret analysis subsume recent related work significantly expand applicability method method provide sub-linear regret bound use relaxed assumption theoretical guarantee fully capture benefit transformation thus provide data-dependent analysis follow-the-leader algorithm provide insight success use transformation support result experiment simulated real data
