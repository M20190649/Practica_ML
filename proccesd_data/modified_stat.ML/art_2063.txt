 sparse additive functional kernel cca canonical correlation analysis cca classical tool find correlation among component two random vector recent year cca widely apply analysis genomic data common researcher perform multiple assay single set patient sample recent work propose sparse variant cca address high dimensionality data however classical sparse cca base linear model thus limit ability find general correlation paper present two approach high-dimensional nonparametric cca building recent development high-dimensional nonparametric regression present estimation procedure approach analyze theoretical property high-dimensional setting demonstrate effectiveness procedure discover nonlinear correlation via extensive simulation well experiment genomic data
