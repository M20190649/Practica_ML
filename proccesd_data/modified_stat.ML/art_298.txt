 optimisation dans la tection de communaut recouvrantes et quilibre de nash community detection graph subject many algorithm recent method want optimize modularity function show maximum relationship within community find minimum inter-community relation algorithm apply unipartite multipartite direct graph however give np-completeness problem algorithm heuristic guarantee optimum paper introduce algorithm base approximate solution obtain efficient detection algorithm modifie achieve local optimum base function reassignment function potential function therefore computed optimum nash equilibrium supplement method overlap function allow simultaneously two detection mode several experiment show interest approach
