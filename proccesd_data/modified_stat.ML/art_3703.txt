 multi-player bandit -- musical chair approach consider variant stochastic multi-armed bandit problem multiple player simultaneously choose set arm may collide receive reward setting motivate problem arise cognitive radio network especially challenge realistic assumption communication player limited provide communication-free algorithm musical chair attain constant regret high probability well sublinear-regret communication-free algorithm dynamic musical chair difficult setting player dynamically enter leave throughout game moreover algorithm require prior knowledge number player best knowledge first communication-free algorithm type formal guarantee also rigorously compare algorithm previous work complement theoretical finding experiment
