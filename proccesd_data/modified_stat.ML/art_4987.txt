 direct feedback alignment provide learn deep neural network artificial neural network commonly train back-propagation algorithm gradient learning provide back-propagating error layer layer output layer hidden layer recently discover method call feedback-alignment show weight use propagate error backward n't symmetric weight use propagation activation forward fact random feedback weight work evenly well network learn make feedback useful work feedback alignment principle use train hidden layer independently rest network zero initial condition error propagate fixed random feedback connection directly output layer hide layer simple method able achieve zero training error even convolutional network deep network completely without error back-propagation method step towards biologically plausible machine learning error signal almost local symmetric reciprocal weight require experiment show test performance mnist cifar almost good obtain back-propagation fully connect network combine dropout method achieves error permutation invariant mnist task
