 iterative log thresholding sparse reconstruction approach use re-weighted l -penalty show empirically theoretically provide significant improvement recover sparse signal comparison l -relaxation however numerical optimization penalty involve solve problem l -norms objective many time use direct link reweighted l -penalties concave log-regularizer sparsity derive simple prox-like algorithm log-regularized formulation proximal splitting step algorithm closed form solution call algorithm 'log-thresholding analogy soft thresholding l -penalty establish convergence result demonstrate log-thresholding provide accurate sparse reconstruction compare soft hard thresholding furthermore approach directly extend optimization matrix penalty rank i.e nuclear norm penalty re-weigthed version suggest singular-value log-thresholding approach
