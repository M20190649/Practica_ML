 cross-domain sparse cod sparse coding show power effective data representation method however sparse coding approach limit within single domain learning problem paper extend sparse cod cross domain learning problem try learn source domain target domain significant different distribution impose maximum mean discrepancy mmd criterion reduce cross-domain distribution difference sparse code also regularize sparse code class label sample domain increase discriminative ability encouraging experiment result propose cross-domain sparse cod algorithm two challenging task -- image classification photograph oil painting domain multiple user spam detection -- show advantage propose method cross-domain data representation method
