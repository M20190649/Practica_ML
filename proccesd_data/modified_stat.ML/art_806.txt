 generative adversarial net density ratio estimation perspective generative adversarial network gans successful deep generative model gans base two-player minimax game however objective function derive original motivation change obtain strong gradient learn generator propose novel algorithm repeat density ratio estimation f-divergence minimization algorithm offer new perspective toward understanding gans able make use multiple viewpoint obtain research density ratio estimation e.g divergence stable relative density ratio useful
