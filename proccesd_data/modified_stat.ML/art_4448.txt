 causality refine diagnostic prediction apply machine learning health care domain show promising result recent year interpretable output learn algorithm desirable decision making health care personnel work explore possibility utilize causal relationship refine diagnostic prediction focus task diagnostic prediction use discomfort drawing explore two way employ causal identification improve diagnostic result firstly use causal identification infer causal relationship among diagnostic label provide interpretable result aid decision making training health care personnel secondly suggest post-processing approach inferred causal relationship use refine prediction accuracy multi-view probabilistic model experimental result show firstly causal identification capable detect causal relationship among diagnostic label correctly secondly potential improve pain diagnostics prediction accuracy use causal relationship
