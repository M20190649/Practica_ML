 sparse additive gaussian process soft interaction additive nonparametric regression model provide attractive tool variable selection high dimension relationship response predictor complex offer great flexibility compare parametric non-linear regression model good interpretability scalability non-parametric regression model however achieve sparsity simultaneously number nonparametric component well variable within nonparametric component pose stiff computational challenge article develop novel bayesian additive regression model use combination hard soft shrinkage separately control number additive component variable within component efficient algorithm develop select importance variable estimate interaction network excellent performance obtain simulated real data example
