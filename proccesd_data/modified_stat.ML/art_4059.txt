 spectral convolution network previous research show computation convolution frequency domain provide significant speedup versus traditional convolution network implementation however performance increase come expense repeatedly compute transform inverse order apply network operation activation pooling dropout show mathematically convolution activation implement frequency domain use either fourier laplace transformation main contribution description spectral activation fourier transform description efficient algorithm compute convolution activation laplace transform compute convolution activation function frequency domain reduce number transforms require well reduce overall complexity description spectral activation function together exist spectral analog network function may use compose fully spectral implementation convolution network
