 highly scalable tensor factorization prediction drug-protein interaction type understanding type inhibitory interaction play important role drug design therefore researcher interested know whether drug competitive non-competitive interaction particular protein target method analyze interaction type propose factorization method macau allow u combine different measurement type single tensor together protein compound compound characterize high dimensional ecfp fingerprint novelty propose method use specially design noise injection mcmc sampler incorporate high dimensional side information i.e. million unique ecfp compound feature even large scale datasets million compound without side information case tensor factorization would practically futile result use public ic ki data chembl train model identify latent subspace separate two measurement type ic ki result suggest propose method detect competitive inhibitory activity compound protein
