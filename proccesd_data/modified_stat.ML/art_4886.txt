 use sparse filtering covariate shift adaptation paper formally analyse use sparse filter algorithm perform covariate shift adaptation provide theoretical analysis sparse filtering evaluate condition require perform covariate shift adaptation prove sparse filtering perform adaptation conditional distribution label structure explain cosine metric overcome limitation propose new algorithm name periodic sparse filtering carry theoretical analysis regard covariate shift adaptation show periodic sparse filtering perform adaptation looser realistic requirement conditional distribution label periodic structure may satisfy instance user-dependent data set experimentally validate theoretical result synthetic data moreover apply periodic sparse filter real-world data set demonstrate simple computationally efficient algorithm able achieve competitive performance
