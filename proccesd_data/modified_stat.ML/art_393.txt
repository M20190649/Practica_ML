 novel deviation bound mixture independent bernoulli variable application miss mass paper concern obtain distribution-free concentration inequality mixture independent bernoulli variable incorporate notion variance miss mass total probability mass associate outcome see give sample important quantity connect density estimate obtain sample population discrete distribution therefore specifically motivate apply method study concentration miss mass express mixture bernoulli novel way derive first time bernstein-like large deviation bound missing mass whose exponent behave almost linearly respect deviation size also sharpen mcallester ortiz berend kontorovich large sample size case small deviation interesting case learn theory meantime approach show heterogeneity issue introduce mcallester ortiz resolvable case miss mass sense one use standard inequality may lead strong result thus postulate result general apply provide potentially sharp bernstein-like bound constraint
