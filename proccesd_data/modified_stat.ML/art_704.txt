 learn instrumental variable non-gaussianity assumption theoretical limitation practical algorithm learn causal effect observational data straightforward possible without assumption hidden common cause treatment x outcome block measurement one possibility use instrumental variable principle possible assumption discover whether variable structurally instrumental target causal effect x rightarrow current framework somewhat lack general assumption instrumental variable discovery problem challenge variable test instrument isolation group different variable might require different condition consider instrument moreover identification constraint might hard detect statistically paper give theoretical characterization instrumental variable discovery highlight identifiability problem solution need non-gaussianity assumption fit within exist method
