 bayesian dark knowledge consider problem bayesian parameter estimation deep neural network important problem setting may little data need accurate posterior predictive density e.g. application involve bandit active learning one simple approach use online monte carlo method sgld stochastic gradient langevin dynamic unfortunately method need store many copy parameter waste memory need make prediction use many version model waste time describe method distil monte carlo approximation posterior predictive density compact form namely single deep neural network compare two recent approach bayesian neural network namely approach base expectation propagation hernandez-lobato adam approach base variational bayes blundell et al. method perform good much simple implement use less computation test time
