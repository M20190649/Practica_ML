 debiased distributed estimation sparse partially linear model diverge dimension consider distributed estimation double-penalized least square approach high dimensional partial linear model sample total n data point randomly distribute among machine parameter interest calculate merge individual estimator paper primarily focus investigation high dimensional linear component partial linear model often interest propose new debiased average estimator parametric coefficient basis individual estimator establish new non-asymptotic oracle result high dimensional distributed setting provide leq sqrt n log p mild condition satisfy p linear coefficient dimension also provide experimental evaluation propose method indicate numerical effectiveness simulated data even classical non-distributed setting give optimal rate parametric estimator looser tune parameter limitation require error analysis
