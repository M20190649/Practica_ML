 order-invariant prior specification bayesian factor analysis exploratory factor analysis loading matrix identify orthogonal rotation identifiability one thus often take load matrix low triangular positive diagonal entry bayesian inference standard practice specify prior loading independent off-diagonal loading normally distribute diagonal loading follow truncated normal distribution prior specification however depend important way variable associated row loading matrix order show minor modification approach allow one compute identifiable low triangular loading matrix maintain invariance property reordering variable
