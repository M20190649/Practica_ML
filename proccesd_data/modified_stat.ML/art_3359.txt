 supervise learning dynamical system learn recently substantial interest spectral method learn dynamical system method popular since often offer good tradeoff computational statistical efficiency unfortunately difficult use extend practice e.g. make difficult incorporate prior information sparsity structure address problem present new view dynamical system learning show learn dynamical system solve sequence ordinary supervise learn problem thereby allow user incorporate prior knowledge via standard technique l regularization many exist spectral method special case new framework use linear regression supervised learner demonstrate effectiveness framework show example nonlinear regression lasso let u learn good state representation plain linear regression correctness instance follow directly general analysis
