 estimate time-varying brain connectivity network functional mri time series understand functional architecture brain term network become increasingly common fmri application functional network assume stationary result single network estimate entire time course however recent result suggest connectivity brain region highly non-stationary even rest result need new brain imaging methodology comprehensively account dynamic i.e. non-stationary nature fmri data work propose smooth incremental graphical lasso estimation single algorithm estimate dynamic brain network fmri data apply single algorithm functional mri data healthy patient perform choice-response task demonstrate dynamic change network structure accompany simple attentionally demand cognitive task use graph theoretic measure show right inferior frontal gyrus frequently report play important role cognitive control dynamically change task result suggest right inferior frontal gyrus play fundamental role attention executive function cognitively demand task may play key role regulate balance brain region
