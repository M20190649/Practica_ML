 algorithmic framework compute validation performance bound use suboptimal model practical model building process often time-consuming many different model must train validate paper introduce novel algorithm use compute low upper bound model validation error without actually train model key idea behind algorithm use side information available suboptimal model reasonably good suboptimal model available algorithm compute low upper bound many useful quantity make inference unknown target model demonstrate advantage algorithm context model selection regularized learning problem
