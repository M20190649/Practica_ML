 fast computation wasserstein barycenter present new algorithm compute mean set empirical probability measure optimal transport metric mean know wasserstein barycenter measure minimize sum wasserstein distance element set propose two original algorithm compute wasserstein barycenter build upon subgradient method direct implementation algorithm however costly would require repeated resolution large primal dual optimal transport problem compute subgradients extend work cuturi propose smooth wasserstein distance use definition wasserstein barycenter entropic regularizer recover strictly convex objective whose gradient compute considerably cheap computational cost use matrix scale algorithm use algorithm visualize large family image solve constrained clustering problem
