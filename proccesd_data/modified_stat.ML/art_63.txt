 laplacian support vector machine train primal last year due grow ubiquity unlabeled data much effort spend machine learn community develop good understanding improve quality classifier exploit unlabeled data follow manifold regularization approach laplacian support vector machine lapsvms show state art performance semi -- supervised classification paper present two strategy solve primal lapsvm problem order overcome issue original dual formulation whereas train lapsvm dual require two step use primal form allow u collapse training single step moreover computational complexity training algorithm reduce n n use preconditioned conjugate gradient n combined number labeled unlabeled example speed training use early stopping strategy base prediction unlabeled data available label validation example allow algorithm quickly compute approximate solution roughly classification accuracy optimal one considerably reduce training time due simplicity train lapsvm primal starting point additional enhancement original lapsvm formulation deal large datasets present extensive experimental evaluation real world data show benefit propose approach
