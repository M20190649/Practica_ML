 exact recovery sparse signal via conic relaxation note compare two recently propose semidefinite relaxation sparse linear regression problem pilanci wainwright el ghaoui sparse learn via boolean relaxation dong chen linderoth relaxation vs. regularization conic optimization perspective statistical variable selection focus cardinality constrain formulation prove relaxation propose dong etc theoretically weak one propose pilanci etc therefore sufficient condition exact recovery derive pilanci readily apply relaxation include result high probability recovery gaussian ensemble finally provide empirical evidence relaxation dong etc require much few observation guarantee recovery true support
