 approximate vanish ideal via data knot vanishing ideal set polynomial take zero value give data point originally propose computer algebra vanish ideal recently exploit extract nonlinear structure data many application avoid overfitting noisy data polynomial often design approximately rather exactly equal zero designate data although approximation empirically demonstrate high performance sound algebraic structure vanishing ideal lose present paper propose vanish ideal tolerant noisy data also pursue good algebraic structure new problem simultaneously find set polynomial data point polynomial approximately vanish input data point almost exactly vanish discover data point experimental classification test method discover much few lower-degree polynomial exist state-of-the-art method consequently method accelerate runtime classification task without degrade classification accuracy
