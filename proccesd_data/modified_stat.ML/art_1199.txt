 deep nonparametric estimation discrete conditional distribution via smooth dyadic partitioning present approach deep estimation discrete conditional probability distribution model several application include generative modeling audio image video data approach combine two main technique dyadic partitioning graph-based smoothing discrete space recursively decompose dimension series binary split smooth result distribution use graph-based trend filtering impose strict structure model achieve much high sample efficiency demonstrate advantage model series benchmark synthetic real-world datasets case reduce error nearly half comparison popular method literature model implement tensorflow publicly available http github.com tansey sdp
