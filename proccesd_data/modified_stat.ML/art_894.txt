 scalable multi-class gaussian process classification use expectation propagation paper describe expectation propagation ep method multi-class classification gaussian process scale well large datasets method estimate log-marginal-likelihood involve sum across data instance enable efficient train use stochastic gradient mini-batches type training use computational cost depend number data instance n furthermore extra assumption approximate inference process make memory cost independent n consequence propose ep method use datasets million instance compare empirically method alternative approach approximate required computation use variational inference result show perform similar even good technique sometimes give significantly bad predictive distribution term test log-likelihood besides training process propose approach also seem converge small number iteration
