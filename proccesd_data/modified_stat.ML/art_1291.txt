 vertex nomination via seed graph match consider two network overlap non-identical vertex set give vertex interest first network seek identify corresponding vertex exist second network moderately size network graph match method apply directly recover missing correspondence herein present principled methodology appropriate situation network large brute-force graph matching methodology identifies vertex local neighborhood vertex interest first network verifiable corresponding vertex second network leverage know correspondence refer seed match induced subgraphs network generate neighborhood verified seed rank vertex second network term likely match original vertex interest demonstrate applicability methodology simulation real data example
