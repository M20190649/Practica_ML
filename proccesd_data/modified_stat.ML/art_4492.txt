 lipschitz continuity smoothness loss function learn rank binary classification regression problem well understood lipschitz continuity smoothness loss function play key role govern generalization error bound empirical risk minimization algorithm paper show two property affect generalization error bound learning rank problem learning rank problem involve vector value prediction therefore choice norm respect lipschitz continuity smoothness define becomes crucial choose ell infty norm definition lipschitz continuity allow u improve exist bound furthermore smoothness assumption choice enable u prove rate interpolate sqrt n n rate application result listnet popular learning rank method give state-of-the-art performance guarantee
