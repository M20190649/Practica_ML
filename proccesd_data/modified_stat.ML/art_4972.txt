 robust discriminative clustering sparse regularizers cluster high-dimensional data often require form dimensionality reduction cluster variable separate noise-looking variable cast problem find low-dimensional projection data well-clustered yield one-dimensional projection simple situation two cluster extend naturally multi-label scenario two cluster paper first show joint clustering dimension reduction formulation equivalent previously propose discriminative clustering framework thus lead convex relaxation problem b propose novel sparse extension still cast convex relaxation allow estimation high dimension c propose natural extension multi-label scenario provide new theoretical analysis performance formulation simple probabilistic model lead scaling form sqrt n affine invariant case n sparse case n number example ambient dimension finally e propose efficient iterative algorithm running-time complexity proportional nd improve early algorithm quadratic complexity number example
