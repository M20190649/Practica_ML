 gram graph-based attention model healthcare representation learn deep learning method exhibit promising performance predictive modeling healthcare two important challenge remain -data insufficiency often healthcare predictive modeling sample size insufficient deep learning method achieve satisfactory result -interpretation representation learn deep learn method align medical knowledge address challenge propose graph-based attention model gram supplement electronic health record ehr hierarchical information inherent medical ontology base data volume ontology structure gram represent medical concept combination ancestor ontology via attention mechanism compare predictive performance i.e accuracy data need interpretability gram various method include recurrent neural network rnn two sequential diagnosis prediction task one heart failure prediction task compare basic rnn gram achieve high accuracy predict disease rarely observe training data improved area roc curve predict heart failure use order magnitude le training data additionally unlike method medical concept representation learn gram well align medical ontology finally gram exhibit intuitive attention behavior adaptively generalize high level concept face data insufficiency low level concept
