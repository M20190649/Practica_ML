 narrow gap random forest theory practice despite widespread interest practical use theoretical property random forest still well understood paper contribute understanding two way present new theoretically tractable variant random regression forest prove algorithm consistent also provide empirical evaluation compare algorithm theoretically tractable random forest model random forest algorithm use practice experiment provide insight relative importance different simplification theoretician make obtain tractable model analysis
