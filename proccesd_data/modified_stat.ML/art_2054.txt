 groupwise constrain reconstruction subspace cluster reconstruction base subspace cluster method compute self reconstruction matrix sample use spectral cluster obtain final clustering result success largely rely assumption underlying subspace independent however always hold application increase number subspace paper propose novel reconstruction base subspace cluster model without make subspace independence assumption model certain property reconstruction matrix explicitly characterize use latent cluster indicator affinity matrix use spectral clustering directly build posterior latent cluster indicator instead reconstruction matrix experimental result synthetic real-world datasets show propose model outperform state-of-the-art method
