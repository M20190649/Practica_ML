 unfolding latent tree structure use th order tensor discover latent structure many observed variable important yet challenge learn task exist approach discover latent structure often require unknown number hidden state input paper propose quartet base approach emph agnostic number key contribution novel rank characterization tensor associate marginal distribution quartet characterization allow u design emph nuclear norm base test resolve quartet relation use quartet test subroutine divide-and-conquer algorithm recover latent tree structure mild condition algorithm consistent error probability decay exponentially increase sample size demonstrate propose approach compare favorably alternative real world stock dataset also discover meaningful grouping variable produce model fit data better
