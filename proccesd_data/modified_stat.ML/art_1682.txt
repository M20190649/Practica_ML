 towards stratification learn homology inference topological approach stratification learning develop point cloud data drawn stratified space give data objective infer point belong stratum first define multi-scale notion stratified space give stratification radius level use method derive kernel cokernel persistent homology cluster data point different stratum prove result guarantee correctness clustering give certain topological condition geometric intuition topological condition also provide correctness result give probabilistic flavor give bound minimum number sample point require infer probability point belong stratum finally give explicit algorithm clustering prove correctness apply simulate data
