 active learn tree graph investigate problem active learning give tree whose node assign binary label adversarial way inspire recent result guillory bilmes characterize constant factor optimal placement query minimize mistake make non-queried node query selection algorithm extremely efficient optimal number mistake non-queried node achieve simple efficient mincut classifier simple modification query selection algorithm also show optimality constant factor respect trade-off number query number mistake non-queried node use span tree algorithm efficiently apply general graph although problem find optimal efficient active learning algorithm general graph remain open towards end provide low bound number mistake make arbitrary graph active learning algorithm use number query constant fraction graph size
