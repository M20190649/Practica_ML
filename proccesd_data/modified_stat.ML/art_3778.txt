 minimax low bound realizable transductive classification transductive learning considers training set label sample test set u unlabeled sample goal best label particular test set conversely inductive learning considers training set label sample draw iid p x goal best label future sample draw iid p x comparison suggest transduction much easy type inference induction really case paper provide negative answer question prove first know minimax lower bound transductive realizable binary classification low bound show least omega epsilon log delta epsilon epsilon -learning concept class mathcal h finite vc-dimension infty confidence delta leq u result draw three important conclusion first general transduction hard general induction since problem omega minimax value second use unlabeled data help general transduction since supervise learn algorithm erm hanneke match transductive low bound ignore unlabeled test set third transductive low bound imply low bound semi-supervised learning add important discussion role unlabeled data machine learning
