 quantile universal threshold model selection detection edge high-dimensional linear regression estimate sparse linear model data gaussian noise consilience lasso compress sense literature thresholding estimator like lasso dantzig selector ability situation identify high probability part significant covariates asymptotically numerically tractable thanks convexity yet selection threshold parameter lambda remain crucial practice aim propose quantile universal thresholding selection lambda detection edge show extensive simulation real data excellent compromise high true positive rate low false discovery rate achieve lead also good predictive risk
