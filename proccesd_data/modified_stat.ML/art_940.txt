 efficient admm algorithm structural break detection multivariate time series present efficient alternate direction method multiplier admm algorithm segment multivariate non-stationary time series structural break stationary region draw recent work series assume follow vector autoregressive model within segment convex estimation procedure may formulate use group fuse lasso penalty admm approach first split convex problem global quadratic program simple group lasso proximal update show global problem may parallelize row time dependent transition matrix furthermore subproblem may rewrite form identical log-likelihood gaussian state space model consequently develop kalman smooth algorithm solve global update time linear length series
