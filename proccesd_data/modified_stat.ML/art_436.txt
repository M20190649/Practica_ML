 direct density-derivative estimation application kl-divergence approximation estimation density derivative versatile tool statistical data analysis naive approach first estimate density compute derivative however two-step approach work well good density estimator necessarily mean good density-derivative estimator paper give direct method approximate density derivative without estimate density propose estimator allow analytic computationally efficient approximation multi-dimensional high-order density derivative ability hyper-parameters choose objectively cross-validation show propose density-derivative estimator useful improve accuracy non-parametric kl-divergence estimation via metric learning practical superiority propose method experimentally demonstrate change detection feature selection
