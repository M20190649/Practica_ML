 universal dependency analysis data multi-dimensional discover whether subset dimension subspace data significantly correlate core task data mining require measure quantify correlate subspace practical use measure universal sense capture correlation subspace dimensionality allow meaningfully compare correlation score across different subspace regardless many dimension specific statistical property dimension posse would nice measure non-parametrically efficiently capture linear non-linear correlation paper propose uds multivariate correlation measure fulfill desideratum short define uds base cumulative entropy propose principled normalization scheme bring score across different subspace domain enable universal correlation assessment uds purely non-parametric make assumption data distribution type correlation compute empirical data introduce efficient non-parametric method extensive experiment show uds outperforms state art
