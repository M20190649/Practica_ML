 algorithmic composition melody deep recurrent neural network big challenge algorithmic composition devise model easily trainable able reproduce long-range temporal dependency typical music investigate artificial neural network train large corpus melody turn automated music composer able generate new melody coherent style train employ gated recurrent unit network show particularly efficient learn complex sequential activation arbitrary long time lag model process rhythm melody parallel model relation two feature use approach able generate interesting complete melody suggest possible continuation melody fragment coherent characteristic fragment
