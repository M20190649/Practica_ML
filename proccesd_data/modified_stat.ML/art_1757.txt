 rademacher complexity stationary sequence show control generalization error time series model wherein past value outcome use predict future value result base generalization standard i.i.d concentration inequality dependent data without mixing assumption common time series setting proof result simple previous analysis dependent data stochastic adversary use sequential rademacher complexity rather expected rademacher complexity i.i.d process also derive empirical rademacher result without mix assumption result fully calculable upper bound
