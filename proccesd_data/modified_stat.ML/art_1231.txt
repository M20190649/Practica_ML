 adaptivity noise parameter nonparametric active learning work address various open question theory active learning nonparametric classification contribution statistical algorithmic -we establish new minimax-rates active learning common textit noise condition rate display interesting transition -- due interaction noise textit smoothness margin -- present passive setting transition previously conjecture remain unconfirmed -we present generic algorithmic strategy adaptivity unknown noise smoothness margin strategy achieve optimal rate many general situation furthermore unlike previous work avoid need textit adaptive confidence set result strictly mild distributional requirement
