 bayesian optimization exponential convergence paper present bayesian optimization method exponential convergence without need auxiliary optimization without delta-cover sampling bayesian optimization method require auxiliary optimization additional non-convex global optimization problem time-consuming hard implement practice also exist bayesian optimization method exponential convergence require access delta-cover sampling consider impractical approach eliminate requirement achieve exponential convergence rate
