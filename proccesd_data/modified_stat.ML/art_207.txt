 semi-supervised learn density-ratio estimation paper study statistical property semi-supervised learning consider important problem community machine learning standard supervise learning label data observe classification regression problem formalize supervised learning semi-supervised learning unlabeled data also obtain addition label data hence exploit unlabeled data important improve prediction accuracy semi-supervised learning problem regard semiparametric estimation problem miss data discriminative probabilistic model consider unlabeled data useless improve estimation accuracy recently reveal weighted estimator use unlabeled data achieves good prediction accuracy comparison learning method use label data especially discriminative probabilistic model misspecified improvement semiparametric model miss data possible semiparametric model misspecified paper apply density-ratio estimator obtain weight function semi-supervised learning benefit approach propose estimator require well-specified probabilistic model probability unlabeled data base statistical asymptotic theory prove estimation accuracy method outperform supervised learning use label data numerical experiment present usefulness method
