 gaussian process optimization mutual information paper analyze generic algorithm scheme sequential global optimization use gaussian process upper bound derive cumulative regret generic algorithm improve exponential factor previously know bound algorithm like gp-ucb also introduce novel gaussian process mutual information algorithm gp-mi significantly improve upper bound cumulative regret confirm efficiency algorithm synthetic real task natural competitor gp-ucb also expected improvement heuristic
