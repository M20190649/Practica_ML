 sparse representation classification beyond l minimization subspace assumption sparse representation classifier src utilize various classification problem make use l minimization show work well image recognition problem satisfy subspace assumption paper propose new implementation src via screening establish equivalence original src regularity condition prove classification consistency latent subspace model result demonstrated via simulation real data experiment new algorithm achieve comparable numerical performance significantly faster
