 anomaly detection base indicator aggregation automatic anomaly detection major issue various area beyond mere detection identification source problem produce anomaly also essential particularly case aircraft engine health monitoring detect early sign failure anomaly help engine owner implement efficiently adapted maintenance operation fix source anomaly crucial importance reduce cost attach unscheduled maintenance paper introduce general methodology aim classify monitoring signal normal one several class abnormal one main idea leverage expert knowledge generate large number binary indicator indicator correspond fully parametrized anomaly detector build parametric anomaly score design expert feature selection method use keep discriminant indicator use input naive bayes classifier give interpretable classifier base interpretable anomaly detector whose parameter optimize indirectly selection process propose methodology evaluate simulated data design reproduce anomaly type observe real world engine
