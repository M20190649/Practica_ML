 semi-supervised collective classification via hybrid label regularization many classification problem involve data instance interlink webpage connect hyperlink technique collective classification cc often increase accuracy data graph usually require fully-labeled training graph contrast examine improve semi-supervised learning cc model give sparsely-labeled graph common situation first describe use novel combination classifier exploit different characteristic relational feature vs. non-relational feature also extend idea label regularization hybrid classifier enable leverage unlabeled data bias learning process find technique efficient easy implement significantly increase accuracy three real datasets addition result explain conflicting finding prior relate study
