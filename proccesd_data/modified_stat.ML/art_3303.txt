 tensor machine learn target-specific polynomial feature recent year demonstrate use random feature map significantly decrease training test time kernel-based algorithm without significantly lower accuracy regrettably random feature target-agnostic typically thousand feature necessary achieve acceptable accuracy work consider problem learn small number explicit polynomial feature approach name tensor machine find parsimonious set feature optimize hypothesis class introduce kar karnick random feature map target-specific manner exploit natural connection polynomial tensor provide bound generalization error tensor machine empirically tensor machine behave favorably several real-world datasets compare state-of-the-art technique learn polynomial feature deliver significantly parsimonious model
