 adaptive resample-move algorithm estimate normalizing constant estimation normalize constant fundamental step probabilistic model comparison sequential monte carlo method may use task advantage inherently parallelizable however standard choice use fixed number particle iteration suboptimal step contribute disproportionately variance estimate introduce adaptive version resample-move algorithm particle set adaptively expand whenever good approximation intermediate distribution need algorithm build expression optimal number particle corresponding minimum variance find ideal condition benchmark result challenge gaussian process classification restrict boltzmann machine application show adaptive resample-move arm estimate normalizing constant small variance use less computational resource either resample-move fixed number particle anneal importance sampling advantage annealed importance sampling arm easy tune
