 l -norm sparse graph-regularized svd biclustering learn blocking structure central challenge high dimensional data e.g. gene expression data recently sparse singular value decomposition svd use biclustering tool achieve goal however model ignore structural information variable e.g. gene interaction graph although typical graph-regularized norm incorporate prior graph information get accurate discovery good interpretability fail consider opposite effect variable different sign motivate development sparse coding graph-regularized norm propose novel sparse graph-regularized svd powerful biclustering tool analyze high-dimensional data key method impose two penalty include novel graph-regularized norm pmb u pmb l pmb u l -norm pmb u singular vector induce structural sparsity enhance interpretability design efficient alternate iterative sparse projection aisp algorithm solve finally apply method related one simulate real data show efficiency capture natural block structure
