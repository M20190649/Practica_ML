 stable feature selection brain smri neuroimage analysis usually involve learn thousand even million variable use limited number sample regard sparse model e.g lasso apply select optimal feature achieve high diagnosis accuracy lasso however usually result independent unstable feature stability manifest reproducibility statistical result subject reasonable perturbation data model important focus statistic especially analysis high dimensional data paper explore nonnegative generalized fuse lasso model stable feature selection diagnosis alzheimer 's disease addition sparsity model incorporate two important pathological prior spatial cohesion lesion voxels positive correlation feature disease label optimize model propose efficient algorithm prove novel link total variation fast network flow algorithm via conic duality experiment show propose nonnegative model performs much well explore intrinsic structure data via select stable feature compare state-of-the-arts
