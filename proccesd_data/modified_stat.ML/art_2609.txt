 high-dimensional joint sparsity random effect model multi-task learning joint sparsity regularization multi-task learning attract much attention recent year traditional convex formulation employ group lasso relaxation achieve joint sparsity across task although approach lead simple convex formulation suffer several issue due looseness relaxation remedy problem view jointly sparse multi-task learning specialized random effect model derive convex relaxation approach involve two step first step learn covariance matrix coefficient use convex formulation refer sparse covariance coding second step solve ridge regression problem sparse quadratic regularizer base covariance matrix obtain first step show approach produce asymptotically optimal quadratic regularizer multitask learn set number task approach infinity experimental result demonstrate convex formulation obtain via propose model significantly outperform group lasso related multi-stage formulation
