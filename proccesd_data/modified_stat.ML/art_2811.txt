 incidence geometry approach dictionary learning study dictionary learning aka sparse cod problem obtain sparse representation data point learn emph dictionary vector upon data point write sparse linear combination view problem geometry perspective span set subspace arrangement focus understand case underlie hypergraph subspace arrangement specify fitted dictionary learning problem completely characterize combinatorics associated subspace arrangement i.e underlying hypergraphs specifically combinatorial rigidity-type theorem prove type geometric incidence system theorem characterize hypergraphs subspace arrangement generically yield least one dictionary b locally unique dictionary i.e finite number isolated dictionary specified size unaware prior application combinatorial rigidity technique setting dictionary learning even machine learning also provide systematic classification problem relate dictionary learn together various algorithm assumption performance
