 survey non-exchangeable prior bayesian nonparametric model dependent nonparametric process extend distribution measure dirichlet process beta process give distribution collection measure typically index value covariate space model appropriate prior exchangeability assumption hold instead want model vary fluidly set covariates since concept dependent nonparametric process formalize maceachern number model propose use statistic machine learning literature many model exhibit underlying similarity understanding hope help select appropriate prior develop new model leverage inference technique
