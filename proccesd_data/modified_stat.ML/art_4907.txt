 recursion-free online multiple incremental decremental analysis base ridge support vector learn study present rapid multiple incremental decremental mechanism base weight-error curve wecs support-vector analysis recursion-free computation propose predict lagrangian multiplier new sample study examine ridge support vector model subsequently devise recursion-free function derive wecs propose function new lagrangian multiplier compute without use gradual step size moreover function relax constraint increment new multiple lagrangian multiplier previous work thereby easily satisfy requirement kkt condition propose mechanism longer require typical bookkeeping strategy compute step size check training sample incremental round
