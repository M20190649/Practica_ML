 signal recovery union subspace application compressive imaging application range communication genetics signal model lying union subspace model signal coefficient lie certain subspace active inactive together potential subspace know advance particular set subspace active i.e. signal support must learn measurement show exploit knowledge subspace reduce number measurement require exact signal recovery derive universal bound number measurement need bound universal sense depend number subspace consideration orientation relative particular subspace e.g. composition dimension extent overlap etc affect result obtain process derive sample complexity bound special case group lasso overlap group latent group lasso use variety application finally also show wavelet transform coefficient image model lie group hence efficiently recover use group lasso method
