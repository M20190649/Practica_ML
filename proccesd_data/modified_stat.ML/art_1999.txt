 efficient sparse group feature selection via nonconvex optimization sparse feature selection demonstrate effective handle high-dimensional data promise exist work use convex method may suboptimal term accuracy feature selection parameter estimation paper expand nonconvex paradigm sparse group feature selection motivate application require identify underlie group structure performing feature selection simultaneously main contribution article twofold statistically introduce nonconvex sparse group feature selection model reconstruct oracle estimator therefore consistent feature selection parameter estimation achieve computationally propose efficient algorithm applicable large-scale problem numerical result suggest propose nonconvex method compare favorably competitor synthetic data real-world application thus achieve desired goal deliver high performance
