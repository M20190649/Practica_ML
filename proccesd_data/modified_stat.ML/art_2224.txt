 efficient em training gaussian mixture miss data data-mining application frequently face large fraction miss entry data matrix problematic discriminant machine learn algorithm solution explore paper use generative model mixture gaussians compute conditional expectation miss variable give observed variable since train gaussian mixture many different pattern miss value computationally expensive introduce spanning-tree base algorithm significantly speed train condition also observe good result obtain use generative model fill-in miss value separate discriminant learn algorithm
