 bayesian masking sparse bayesian estimation weak shrinkage bias common strategy sparse linear regression introduce regularization eliminate irrelevant feature let corresponding weight zero however regularization often shrink estimator relevant feature lead incorrect feature selection motivate above-mentioned issue propose bayesian masking bm sparse estimation method impose regularization weight key concept bm introduce binary latent variable randomly mask feature estimate masking rate determine relevance feature automatically derive variational bayesian inference algorithm maximize low bound factorized information criterion fic recently develop asymptotic criterion evaluate marginal log-likelihood addition propose reparametrization accelerate convergence derived algorithm finally show bm outperforms lasso automatic relevance determination ard term sparsity-shrinkage trade-off
