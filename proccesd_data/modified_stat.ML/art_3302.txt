 average acceleration step-size show accelerate gradient descent average gradient descent heavy-ball method non-strongly-convex problem may reformulate constant parameter second-order difference equation algorithm stability system equivalent convergence rate n n number iteration provide detailed analysis eigenvalue corresponding linear dynamical system show various oscillatory non-oscillatory behavior together sharp stability result explicit constant also consider situation noisy gradient available extend general convergence result suggest alternative algorithm i.e. different step size exhibit good aspect average acceleration
