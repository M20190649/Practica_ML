 community detection classification hierarchical stochastic blockmodels propose robust scalable integrated methodology community detection community comparison graph procedure first embed graph appropriate euclidean space obtain low-dimensional representation cluster vertex community next employ nonparametric graph inference technique identify structural similarity among community two step apply recursively community allow u detect fine-grained structure describe hierarchical stochastic blockmodel -- -namely stochastic blockmodel natural hierarchical structure -- -and establish condition algorithm yield consistent estimate model parameter motif define stochastically similar group subgraphs finally demonstrate effectiveness algorithm simulated real data specifically address problem locate similar subcommunities partially reconstruct drosophila connectome social network friendster
