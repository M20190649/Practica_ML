 minimum information principle discriminative learn exponential model distribution widely use machine learning classiffication modelling well know interpret maximum entropy model empirical expectation constraint work argue classiffication task mutual information suitable information theoretic measure optimize show principle minimum mutual information generalize maximum entropy provide comprehensive framework build discriminative classiffiers game theoretic interpretation approach give several generalization bound provide present iterative algorithm solve minimum information problem convex dual demonstrate performance various classiffication task result show minimum information classiffiers outperform corresponding maximum entropy model
