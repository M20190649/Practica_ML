 learn without concentration general loss function study prediction estimation problem use empirical risk minimization relative general convex loss function obtain sharp error rate even concentration false restricted example heavy-tailed scenario result show error rate depend two parameter one capture intrinsic complexity class essentially lead error rate noise-free realizable problem measure interaction class member target loss dominant problem far realizable also explain one may deal outlier choose loss way calibrate intrinsic complexity class noise-level problem latter measure distance target class
