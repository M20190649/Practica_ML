 topological approach spectral clustering propose clustering algorithm input take data assume sample uniform distribution support metric space x output clustering data base topological estimate connected component x algorithm work choose weighted graph sample natural one-parameter family graph use error base heat operator graph estimate connected component x identify support eigenfunctions heat operator eigenvalue allow algorithm work without require number expected cluster input
