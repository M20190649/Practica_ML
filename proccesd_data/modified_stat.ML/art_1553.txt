 conditionally independent multiresolution gaussian process multiresolution gaussian process gp gain increase attention viable approach towards improve quality approximation gps scale well large-scale data current construction assume full independence across resolution assumption simplify inference underestimate uncertainty transition one resolution another turn result model prone overfitting sense excessive sensitivity choose resolution prediction non-smooth boundary contribution new construction instead assume conditional independence among gps across resolution show relax full independence assumption enable robustness overfitting deliver prediction smooth boundary new model compare current state art synthetic real-world datasets case new conditionally independent construction perform favorably compare model base full independence assumption particular exhibit little sign overfitting
