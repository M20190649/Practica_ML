 identifiability causal graph use functional model work address following question assumption data generate process one infer causal graph joint distribution approach take conditional independence-based causal discovery method base two assumption markov condition faithfulness show assumption causal graph identify markov equivalence arrow remain undirected use method like pc algorithm work propose alternative define identifiable functional model class ifmocs main theorem prove data generating process belongs ifmoc one identify complete causal graph best knowledge first identifiability result kind limit linear functional relationship discuss ifmoc assumption markov faithfulness assumption relate explain believe ifmoc assumption test easily give data provide practical algorithm recover causal graph finitely many data experiment simulated data support theoretical finding
