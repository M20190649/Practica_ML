 texture synthesis spatial generative adversarial network generative adversarial network gans recent approach train generative model data show work particularly well image data current paper introduce new model texture synthesis base gan learn extend input noise distribution space single vector whole spatial tensor create architecture property well suit task texture synthesis call spatial gan sgan knowledge first successful completely data-driven texture synthesis method base gans method following feature make state art algorithm texture synthesis high image quality generated texture high scalability w.r.t output texture size fast real-time forward generation ability fuse multiple diverse source image complex texture illustrate capability present multiple experiment different class texture image use case also discuss limitation method respect type texture image synthesize compare neural technique texture generation
