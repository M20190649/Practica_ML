 joint training deep boltzmann machine classification introduce new method train deep boltzmann machine jointly prior method training dbms require initial learning pas train model greedily one layer time perform well classification task approach train layer dbm simultaneously use novel training procedure call multi-prediction training result model either interpret single generative model train maximize variational approximation generalize pseudolikelihood family recurrent network share parameter may approximately average together use novel technique call multi-inference trick show approach performs competitively classification outperform previous method term accuracy approximate inference classification miss input
