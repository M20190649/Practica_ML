 unsupervised learn imbalanced data via structure consolidation latent variable model unsupervised learn imbalanced data challenge give imbalanced data current model often dominate major category ignore category small amount data develop latent variable model cope imbalanced data divide latent space shared space private space base gaussian process latent variable model propose new kernel formulation enable separation latent space derive efficient variational inference method performance model demonstrate imbalanced medical image dataset
