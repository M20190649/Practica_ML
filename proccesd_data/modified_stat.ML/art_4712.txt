 linear dynamical neural population model nonlinear embeddings body recent work model neural activity focus recover low-dimensional latent feature capture statistical structure large-scale neural population approach focus linear generative model inference computationally tractable propose flds general class nonlinear generative model permit fire rate neuron vary arbitrary smooth function latent linear dynamical state extra flexibility allow model capture rich set neural variability purely linear model retain easily visualizable low-dimensional latent space fit class non-conjugate model propose variational inference scheme along novel approximate posterior capable capture rich temporal correlation across time show technique permit inference wide class generative models.we also show application two neural datasets compare state-of-the-art neural population model flds capture much large proportion neural variability small number latent dimension provide superior predictive performance interpretability
