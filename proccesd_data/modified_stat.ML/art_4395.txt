 application generative autoencoder de novo molecular design major challenge computational chemistry generation novel molecular structure desirable pharmacological physiochemical property work investigate potential use autoencoder deep learning methodology de novo molecular design various generative autoencoders use map molecule structure continuous latent space vice versa performance structure generator assess result show latent space preserve chemical similarity principle thus use generation analogue structure furthermore latent space create autoencoders search systematically generate novel compound predicted activity dopamine receptor type compound similar know active compound include training set identify
