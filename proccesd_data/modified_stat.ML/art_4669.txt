 asymptotic property combined l concave regularization two important goal high-dimensional modeling prediction variable selection article consider regularization combined l concave penalty study sample property global optimum suggested method ultra-high dimensional setting l -penalty provide minimum regularization need remove noise variable order achieve oracle prediction risk concave penalty imposes additional regularization control model sparsity linear model setting prove global optimum method enjoy oracle inequality lasso estimator admit explicit bound false sign rate asymptotically vanish moreover establish oracle risk inequality method sampling property computable solution numerical study suggest method yield stable estimate use concave penalty alone
