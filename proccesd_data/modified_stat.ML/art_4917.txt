 kernel ridge regression via partition paper investigate divide conquer approach kernel ridge regression krr give n sample division step involve separate point base underlying disjoint partition input space possibly via clustering compute krr estimate partition conquering step simple partition consider local estimate prediction establish condition give generalization bound estimator well achieve optimal minimax rate also show approximation error component generalization error less single krr estimate fit data thus provide statistical computational advantage single krr estimate entire data averaging random partition recent work lastly provide experimental validation propose estimator assumption
