 efficiency conformalized ridge regression conformal prediction method produce prediction set apply top wide range prediction algorithm method guarantee coverage probability standard iid assumption regardless whether assumption often considerably restrictive underlying algorithm satisfy however method really useful desirable case assumption underlying algorithm satisfy conformal predictor lose little efficiency compare underlie algorithm whereas conformal predictor strong guarantee validity paper explore degree additional requirement efficiency satisfy case bayesian ridge regression find asymptotically conformal prediction set differ little ridge regression prediction interval standard bayesian assumption satisfy
