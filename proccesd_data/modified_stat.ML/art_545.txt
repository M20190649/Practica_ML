 dependent mat rn process multivariate time series challenge task model multivariate time series propose new class model use dependent mat 'ern process capture underlying structure data explain interdependency predict unknown value although similar model propose econometric statistic machine learning literature approach several advantage distinguish exist method flexible provide high prediction accuracy yet complexity control avoid overfitting interpretability separate black-box method finally computational efficiency make scalable high-dimensional time series paper use several simulate real data set illustrate advantage also briefly discuss extension model
