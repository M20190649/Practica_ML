 -bit matrix completion pac-bayesian analysis variational approximation due challenge application collaborative filtering matrix completion problem widely study past year different approach rely different structure assumption matrix hand focus completion possibly low-rank matrix binary entry so-called -bit matrix completion problem approach relies tool machine learn theory empirical risk minimization convex relaxation propose algorithm compute variational approximation pseudo-posterior thanks convex relaxation corresponding minimization problem bi-convex thus method behave well practice also study performance variational approximation pac-bayesian learning bound contrary previous work focus upper bound estimation error various matrix norm able derive analysis pac bound prediction error algorithm focus essentially convex relaxation hinge loss present complete analysis complete simulation study test movielens data set however also discuss variational approximation deal logistic loss
