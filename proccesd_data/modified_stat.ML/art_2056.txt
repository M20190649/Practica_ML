 analysis kernel mean match covariate shift real supervised learning scenario uncommon training test sample follow different probability distribution thus render necessity correct sampling bias focus particular covariate shift problem derive high probability confidence bound kernel mean match kmm estimator whose convergence rate turn depend regularity measure regression function also capacity measure kernel compare kmm natural plug-in estimator establish superiority former hence provide concrete evidence understand effectiveness kmm covariate shift
