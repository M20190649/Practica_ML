 concept drift detection stream data common statistical prediction model often require assume stationarity data however many practical application change relationship response predictor variable regularly observe time result deterioration predictive performance model paper present linear four rate lfr framework detect concept drift subsequently identify data point belong new concept relearn model unlike conventional concept drift detection approach lfr apply batch stream data limit distribution property response variable e.g. datasets imbalanced label independent underlying statistical-model use user-specified parameter intuitively comprehensible performance lfr compare benchmark approach use simulate commonly use public datasets span gamut concept drift type result show lfr significantly outperforms benchmark approach term recall accuracy delay detection concept drift across datasets
