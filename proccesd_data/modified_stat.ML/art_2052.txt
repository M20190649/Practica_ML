 deep mixture factor analyser efficient way learn deep density model many layer latent variable learn one layer time use model one layer latent variable learn layer sample posterior distribution layer use training data learn next layer approach commonly use restricted boltzmann machine undirected graphical model single hidden layer also use mixture factor analyser mfas direct graphical model paper present greedy layer-wise learning algorithm deep mixture factor analyser dmfas even though dmfa convert equivalent shallow mfa multiply together factor load matrix different level learning inference much efficient dmfa sharing lower-level factor load matrix many different high level mfa prevents overfitting demonstrate empirically dmfas learn good density model mfa two type restricted boltzmann machine wide variety datasets
