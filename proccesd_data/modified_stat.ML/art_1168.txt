 stability enhance large-margin classifier selection stability important aspect classification procedure unstable prediction potentially reduce user trust classification system also harm reproducibility scientific conclusion major goal work introduce novel concept classification instability i.e. decision boundary instability dbi incorporate generalization error ge standard select accurate stable classifier specifically implement two-stage algorithm initially select subset classifier whose estimate ge significantly different minimal estimate ge among candidate classifier ii optimal classifier choose one achieve minimal dbi among subset select stage general selection principle applies linear nonlinear classifier large-margin classifier use prototypical example illustrate idea selection method show consistent sense optimal classifier simultaneously achieve minimal ge minimal dbi various simulation real example demonstrate advantage method several alternative approach
