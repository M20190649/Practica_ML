 combine multiple clustering via crowd agreement estimation multi-granularity link analysis cluster ensemble technique aim combine multiple clustering probably well robust clustering receive increase attention recent year mainly two aspect limitation exist clustering ensemble approach firstly many approach lack ability weight base clustering without access original data affect significantly low-quality even ill clustering secondly generally focus instance level cluster level ensemble system fail integrate multi-granularity cue unified model address two limitation paper propose solve clustering ensemble problem via crowd agreement estimation multi-granularity link analysis present normalized crowd agreement index ncai evaluate quality base clustering unsupervised manner thus weight base clustering accordance clustering validity explore relationship cluster source aware connect triple sact similarity introduce regard common neighbor source reliability base ncai multi-granularity information collect among base clustering cluster data instance propose two novel consensus function term weighted evidence accumulation cluster weac graph partition multi-granularity link analysis gp-mgla respectively experiment conduct eight real-world datasets experimental result demonstrate effectiveness robustness propose method
