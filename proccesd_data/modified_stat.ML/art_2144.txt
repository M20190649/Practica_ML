 maximum margin output cod paper study output cod multi-label prediction multi-label output cod discriminative important codewords different label vector significantly different meantime unlike traditional coding theory codewords output cod predict input also critical predictable label encoding find output code discriminative predictable first propose max-margin formulation naturally capture two property convert metric learning formulation exponentially large number constraint commonly encounter structured prediction problem without label structure tractable inference use overgenerating i.e. relaxation technique combine cut plane method optimization empirical study propose output cod scheme outperform variety exist multi-label prediction method image text music classification
