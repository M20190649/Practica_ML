 whitening-free least-squares non-gaussian component analysis non-gaussian component analysis ngca unsupervised linear dimension reduction method extract low-dimensional non-gaussian signal high-dimensional data contaminate gaussian noise ngca regard generalization projection pursuit pp independent component analysis ica multi-dimensional dependent non-gaussian component indeed seminal approach ngca base pp ica recently novel ngca approach call least-squares ngca lsngca develop give solution analytically least-squares estimation log-density gradient eigendecomposition however since pre-whitening data involve lsngca perform unreliably data covariance matrix ill-conditioned often case high-dimensional data analysis paper propose whitening-free lsngca method experimentally demonstrate superiority
