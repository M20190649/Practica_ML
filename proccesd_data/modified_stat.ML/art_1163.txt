 sparse kernel canonical correlation analysis via ell -regularization canonical correlation analysis cca multivariate statistical technique find linear relationship two set variable kernel generalization cca name kernel cca propose find nonlinear relation datasets despite wide usage one common limitation lack sparsity solution paper consider sparse kernel cca propose novel sparse kernel cca algorithm skcca algorithm base relationship kernel cca least square sparsity dual transformation introduce penalize ell -norm dual vector experiment demonstrate algorithm perform well compute sparse dual transformation also alleviate over-fitting problem kernel cca
