 sequential dirichlet process mixture multivariate skew t-distributions model-based clustering flow cytometry data flow cytometry high-throughput technology use quantify multiple surface intracellular marker level single cell enable identify cell sub-types determine relative proportion improvement technology allow describe million individual cell blood sample use multiple marker result high-dimensional datasets whose manual analysis highly time-consuming poorly reproducible several method develop perform automatic recognition cell population treat analyze sample independently however practice individual sample rarely independent e.g longitudinal study propose use bayesian nonparametric approach dirichlet process mixture dpm multivariate skew -distributions perform model base clustering flow-cytometry data dpm model directly estimate number cell population data avoid model selection issue skew -distributions provide robustness outlier non-elliptical shape cell population accommodate repeated measurement propose sequential strategy rely parametric approximation posterior illustrate good performance method simulated data experimental benchmark dataset new longitudinal data dalia- trial evaluate therapeutic vaccine hiv benchmark dataset sequential strategy outperforms method evaluate similarly lead improve performance dalia- data make method available community r package npflow
