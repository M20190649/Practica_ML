 deepsurv personalize treatment recommender system use cox proportional hazard deep neural network medical practitioner use survival model explore understand relationship patient covariates e.g clinical genetic feature effectiveness various treatment option standard survival model like linear cox proportional hazard model require extensive feature engineering prior medical knowledge model treatment interaction individual level nonlinear survival method neural network survival forest inherently model high-level interaction term yet show effective treatment recommender system introduce deepsurv cox proportional hazard deep neural network state-of-the-art survival method model interaction patient 's covariates treatment effectiveness order provide personalized treatment recommendation perform number experiment train deepsurv simulated real survival data demonstrate deepsurv performs well good state-of-the-art survival model validate deepsurv successfully model increasingly complex relationship patient 's covariates risk failure show deepsurv model relationship patient 's feature effectiveness different treatment option show deepsurv use provide individual treatment recommendation finally train deepsurv real clinical study demonstrate 's personalize treatment recommendation would increase survival time set patient predictive model capability deepsurv enable medical researcher use deep neural network tool exploration understanding prediction effect patient 's characteristic risk failure
