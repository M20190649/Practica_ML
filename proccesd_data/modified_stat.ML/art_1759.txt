 hash algorithm large-scale learning paper first demonstrate b-bit minwise hashing whose estimator positive definite kernel naturally integrate learn algorithm svm logistic regression adopt simple scheme transform nonlinear resemblance kernel linear inner product kernel hence large-scale problem solve extremely efficiently method provide simple effective solution large-scale learning massive extremely high-dimensional datasets especially data fit memory compare b-bit minwise hash vowpal wabbit vw algorithm relate count-min cm sketch interestingly vw variance random projection theoretical empirical comparison illustrate usually b -bit minwise hashing significantly accurate storage vw random projection binary data furthermore b -bit minwise hashing combine vw achieve improvement term train speed especially b large
