 estimate class prior posterior noisy positive unlabeled data develop classification algorithm estimate posterior distribution positive-unlabeled data robust noise positive label effective high-dimensional data recent year several algorithm propose learn positive-unlabeled data however many contribution remain theoretical perform poorly real high-dimensional data typically contaminate noise build previous work develop two practical classification algorithm explicitly model noise positive label utilize univariate transforms build discriminative classifier prove univariate transforms preserve class prior enable estimation univariate space avoid kernel density estimation high-dimensional data theoretical development parametric nonparametric algorithm propose constitute important step towards wide-spread use robust classification algorithm positive-unlabeled data
