 advance variational inference many modern unsupervised semi-supervised machine learn algorithms rely bayesian probabilistic model model usually intractable thus require approximate inference variational inference vi let u approximate high-dimensional bayesian posterior simpler variational distribution solve optimization problem approach successfully use various model large-scale application review give overview recent trend variational inference first introduce standard mean field variational inference review recent advance focus following aspect scalable vi include stochastic approximation b generic vi extend applicability vi large class otherwise intractable model non-conjugate model c accurate vi include variational model beyond mean field approximation atypical divergence amortized vi implement inference local latent variable inference network finally provide summary promising future research direction
