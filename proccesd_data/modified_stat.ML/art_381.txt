 safe sample screen support vector machine sparse classifier support vector machine svm efficient test-phases classifier characterize subset sample call support vector svs rest sample non svs influence classification result however advantage sparsity fully exploit training phase generally difficult know sample turn sv beforehand paper introduce new approach call safe sample screen enable u identify subset non-svs screen prior training phase approach different exist heuristic approach sense screened sample guarantee non-svs optimal solution investigate advantage safe sample screen approach intensive numerical experiment demonstrate substantially decrease computational cost state-of-the-art svm solver libsvm current big data era believe safe sample screen would great practical importance since data size reduce without sacrifice optimality final solution
