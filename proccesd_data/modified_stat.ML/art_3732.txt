 estimation sample covariance matrix compressive measurement paper focus estimation sample covariance matrix low-dimensional random projection data know compressive measurement particular present unbiased estimator extract covariance structure compressive measurement obtain general class random projection matrix consist i.i.d zero-mean entry finite first four moment contrast previous work make structural assumption underlying covariance matrix low-rank fact analysis base non-bayesian data setting require distributional assumption set data sample furthermore inspire generality projection matrix propose approach covariance estimation utilizes sparse rademacher matrix therefore algorithm use estimate covariance matrix application limited memory computation power acquisition device experimental result demonstrate approach allow accurate estimation sample covariance matrix several real-world data set include video data
