 mean field variational bayesian inference support vector machine classification mean field variational bayes approach support vector machine svms use latent variable representation polson scott present representation allow circumvention many shortcoming associate classical svms include automatic penalty parameter selection ability handle dependent sample miss data variable selection demonstrate simulate real datasets approach easily extendable non-standard situation outperform classical svm approach whilst remain computationally efficient
