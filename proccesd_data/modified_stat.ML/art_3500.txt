 implicitly constrain semi-supervised least square classification introduce novel semi-supervised version least square classifier implicitly constrain least square icls classifier minimize squared loss label data among set parameter imply possible labelings unlabeled data unlike discriminative semi-supervised method approach introduce explicit additional assumption objective function leverage implicit assumption already present choice supervise least square classifier show approach formulate quadratic programming problem solution find use simple gradient descent procedure prove certain way method never lead performance bad supervise classifier experimental result corroborate theoretical result multidimensional case benchmark datasets also term error rate
