 good arm identification via bandit feedback consider novel stochastic multi-armed bandit problem call em good arm identification gai good arm define arm expect reward great equal give threshold gai pure-exploration problem single agent repeat process output arm soon identify good one confirm arm actually good objective gai minimize number sample process find gai face new kind dilemma em exploration-exploitation dilemma confidence different difficulty best arm identification result efficient design algorithm gai quite different best arm identification derive low bound sample complexity gai tight logarithmic factor mathrm log frac delta acceptance error rate delta also develop algorithm whose sample complexity almost match low bound also confirm experimentally propose algorithm outperform naive algorithm synthetic setting base conventional bandit problem clinical trial research rheumatoid arthritis
