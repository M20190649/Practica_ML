 multidimensional membership mixture model present multidimensional membership mixture model every dimension membership represent independent mixture model data point generate select mixture component jointly helpful data certain shared structure example three unique mean three unique variance effectively form gaussian mixture model nine component require six parameter fully describe paper present three instantiation model together learning inference algorithm infinite finite hybrid depend whether number mixture fix build upon dirichlet process mixture model latent dirichlet allocation combination respectively consider two application topic modeling learn object arrangement experiment show model achieve good performance use few topic many classic topic model also observe topic different dimension model meaningful orthogonal
