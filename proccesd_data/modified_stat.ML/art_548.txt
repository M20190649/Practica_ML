 random subspace learn approach high-dimensional outlier detection introduce develop novel approach outlier detection base adaptation random subspace learning propose method handle high-dimension low-sample size traditional low-dimensional high-sample size datasets essentially avoid computational bottleneck technique like minimum covariance determinant mcd compute needed determinant associated measure much low dimensional subspace theoretical computational development approach reveal computationally efficient regularized method high-dimensional low-sample size often compete favorably exist method far percentage correct outlier detection concern
