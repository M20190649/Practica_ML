 structure prediction gaussian perturbation linear-time principled algorithm margin-based structured prediction commonly use maximum loss possible structure output cite altun collins b taskar natural language processing recent work cite zhang zhang propose use maximum loss random structure output sample independently proposal distribution method linear-time number random structure output trivially parallelizable study family loss function pac-bayes framework gaussian perturbation cite mcallester technical condition statistical accuracy show family loss function produce tighter upper bound gibbs decoder distortion commonly use method thus use maximum loss random structure output principled way learn parameter structured prediction model besides explain experimental success cite zhang zhang theoretical result show general technique possible
