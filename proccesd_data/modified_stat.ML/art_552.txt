 probabilistic backpropagation scalable learning bayesian neural network large multilayer neural network train backpropagation recently achieve state-of-the-art result wide range problem however use backprop neural net learning still disadvantage e.g. tune large number hyperparameters data lack calibrate probabilistic prediction tendency overfit training data principle bayesian approach learn neural network problem however exist bayesian technique lack scalability large dataset network size work present novel scalable method learn bayesian neural network call probabilistic backpropagation pbp similar classical backpropagation pbp work compute forward propagation probability network backward computation gradient series experiment ten real-world datasets show pbp significantly faster technique offer competitive predictive ability experiment also show pbp provide accurate estimate posterior variance network weight
