 mixture generalized hyperbolic factor analyzer model-based clustering impose finite mixture model structure data clustering finite mixture model assume population convex combination finite number density distribution within population basic assumption particular model among distribution try generalized hyperbolic distribution advantage generalization several method gaussian distribution skew t-distribution etc specific parameter represent either symmetric skewed distribution inherent flexibility advantage many way mean estimation parameter special limiting case aim work propose mixture generalized hyperbolic factor analyzer introduce parsimony extend method high dimensional data work see extension mixture factor analyzer model generalize hyperbolic mixture performance generalized hyperbolic factor analyzer illustrate real data perform favourably compare gaussian analogue
