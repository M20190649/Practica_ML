 top-down particle filter bayesian decision tree decision tree learning popular approach classification regression machine learning statistic bayesian formulation -- -which introduce prior distribution decision tree formulate learning posterior inference give data -- -have show produce competitive performance unlike classic decision tree learn algorithm like id c cart work top-down manner exist bayesian algorithm produce approximation posterior distribution evolve complete tree collection thereof iteratively via local monte carlo modification structure tree e.g. use markov chain monte carlo mcmc present sequential monte carlo smc algorithm instead work top-down manner mimic behavior speed classic algorithm demonstrate empirically approach delivers accuracy comparable popular mcmc method operate order magnitude faster thus represent good computation-accuracy tradeoff
