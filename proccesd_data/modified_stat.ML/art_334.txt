 bayesian estimation possible causal direction presence latent confounders use linear non-gaussian acyclic structural equation model individual-specific effect consider learn possible causal direction two observed variable presence latent confound variable several exist method show consistently estimate causal direction assume linear type nonlinear relationship latent confounders however estimation result could distort either assumption actually violate paper first propose new linear non-gaussian acyclic structural equation model individual-specific effect allow latent confounders consider propose empirical bayesian approach estimate possible causal direction use new model demonstrate effectiveness method use artificial real-world data
