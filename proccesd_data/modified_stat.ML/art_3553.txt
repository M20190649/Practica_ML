 maximum likelihood learn arbitrary treewidth via fast-mixing parameter set inference typically intractable high-treewidth undirected graphical model make maximum likelihood learn challenge one way overcome restrict parameter tractable set typically set tree-structured parameter paper explore alternative notion tractable set namely set fast-mixing parameter markov chain monte carlo mcmc inference guarantee quickly converge stationary distribution common practice approximate likelihood gradient use sample obtain mcmc procedure lack theoretical guarantee paper prove exponential family bounded sufficient statistic graphical model parameter constrain fast-mixing set gradient descent gradient approximate sample approximate maximum likelihood solution inside set high-probability unregularized find solution epsilon-accurate log-likelihood require total amount effort cubic epsilon disregard logarithmic factor ridge-regularized strong convexity allow solution epsilon-accurate parameter distance effort quadratic epsilon provide fully-polynomial time randomize approximation scheme
