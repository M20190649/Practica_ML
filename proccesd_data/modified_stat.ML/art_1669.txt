 slice sample covariance hyperparameters latent gaussian model gaussian process gp popular way specify dependency random variable probabilistic model bayesian framework covariance structure specify use unknown hyperparameters integrate hyperparameters considers different possible explanation data make prediction integration often perform use markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling however non-gaussian observation standard hyperparameter sampling approach require careful tuning may converge slowly paper present slice sample approach require little tune mix well strong- weak-data regime
