 efficient multiple incremental computation kernel ridge regression bayesian uncertainty model study present efficient incremental decremental approach big stream base kernel ridge regression krr frequently use data analysis cloud center avoid reanalyzing whole dataset whenever sensor receive new training data typical incremental krr use single-instance mechanism update exist system however inevitably increase redundant computational time mention applicability big stream end propose mechanism support incremental decremental processing single multiple sample i.e. batch processing large scale data divide batch process machine without sacrifice accuracy moreover incremental decremental analysis empirical intrinsic space also propose study handle different type data either large number sample high feature dimension whereas typical method focus one type end study propose mechanism statistical kernelized bayesian regression uncertainty model incremental decremental computation become applicable experimental result show computational time significantly reduce good original nonincremental design typical single incremental method furthermore accuracy propose method remain baseline imply system enhance efficiency without sacrifice accuracy finding prove propose method appropriate variable stream data analysis thereby demonstrate effectiveness propose method
