 freeze-thaw bayesian optimization paper develop dynamic form bayesian optimization machine learning model goal rapidly find good hyperparameter setting method use partial information gain training machine learn model order decide whether pause training start new model resume training previously-considered model specifically tailor method machine learn problem develop novel positive-definite covariance kernel capture variety train curve furthermore develop gaussian process prior scale gracefully additional temporal observation finally provide information-theoretic framework automate decision process experiment several common machine learn model show approach extremely effective practice
