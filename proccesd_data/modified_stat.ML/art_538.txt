 active function cross-entropy cluster gaussian mixture model gmm find many application density estimation data clustering however model adapt well curve strongly nonlinear data recently appear improvement call acagmm active curve axis gaussian mixture model fit gaussians along curve use em-like expectation maximization approach use idea stand behind acagmm build alternative active function model clustering advantage acagmm particular naturally define arbitrary dimension enable easy adaptation clustering complicated datasets along predefined family function moreover need external method determine number cluster automatically reduce number group on-line
