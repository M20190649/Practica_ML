 future search discovery big data analytics ultrametric information space consider observation data comprise n observation vector value set attribute give u n point attribute space data structure tree imply observation embed ultrametric topology offer great advantage proximity searching preprocessed data embedding observation 's near neighbor find constant computational time i.e time powerful approach discuss work inducing hierarchy hence tree linear computational time i.e n time n observation basis proximity search best match address burgeon problem process large possibly also high dimensional data set
