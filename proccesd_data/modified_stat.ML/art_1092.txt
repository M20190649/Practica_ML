 effect additional data bayesian cluster hierarchical probabilistic model mixture model use cluster analysis model two type variable observable latent cluster analysis latent variable estimate expect additional information improve accuracy estimation latent variable many propose learn method able use additional data include semi-supervised learning transfer learning however statistical point view complex probabilistic model encompass initial additional data might less accurate due higher-dimensional parameter present paper present theoretical analysis accuracy model clarifies factor great effect accuracy advantage obtain additional data disadvantage increase complexity
