 jointly cluster row column binary matrix algorithm trade-off standard clustering problem data point represent vector stack together one form data matrix row column cluster structure paper consider class binary matrix arise many application exhibit row column cluster structure goal exactly recover underlying row column cluster observe small fraction noisy entry first derive low bound minimum number observation need exact cluster recovery propose three algorithm different run time compare number observation need successful cluster recovery analytical result show smooth time-data trade-off one gradually reduce computational complexity increasingly observation available
