 conditional density estimation dimensionality reduction via squared-loss conditional entropy minimization regression aim estimate conditional mean output give input however regression informative enough conditional density multimodal heteroscedastic asymmetric case estimate conditional density preferable conditional density estimation cde challenge high-dimensional space naive approach cop high-dimensionality first perform dimensionality reduction dr execute cde however two-step process perform well practice error incur first dr step magnify second cde step paper propose novel single-shot procedure perform cde dr simultaneously integrated way key idea formulate dr problem minimize squared-loss variant conditional entropy solve via cde thus additional cde step need dr. demonstrate usefulness propose method extensive experiment various datasets include humanoid robot transition computer art
