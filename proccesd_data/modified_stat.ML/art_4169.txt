 confident multiple choice learn ensemble method arguably trustworthy technique boost performance machine learning model popular independent ensemble ie rely naive average vote scheme typical choice application involve deep neural network consider advanced collaboration among ensemble model paper propose new ensemble method specialize deep neural network call confident multiple choice learn cmcl variant multiple choice learn mcl via address overconfidence issue.in particular propose major component cmcl beyond original mcl scheme new loss i.e. confident oracle loss ii new architecture i.e. feature sharing iii new training method i.e. stochastic labeling demonstrate effect cmcl via experiment image classification cifar svhn foreground-background segmentation icoseg particular cmcl use residual network provide relative reduction top- error rate corresponding ie scheme classification task cifar svhn respectively
