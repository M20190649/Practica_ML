 directional statistic machine learning brief review modern data analyst must cope data encode various form vector matrix string graph consequently statistical machine learning model tailor different data encoding important focus data encode normalized vector direction important magnitude specifically consider high-dimensional vector lie either surface unit hypersphere real projective plane data briefly review common mathematical model prevalent machine learning also outline technical aspect software application open mathematical challenge
