 approximate joint diagonalization geometric mean symmetric positive definite matrix explore connection two problem arise independently signal processing related field estimation geometric mean set symmetric positive definite spd matrix approximate joint diagonalization ajd today considerable interest estimate geometric mean spd matrix set manifold spd matrix endow fisher information metric result mean several important invariance property prove useful diverse engineering application biomedical image data processing two spd matrix mean algebraic close form solution set two spd matrix estimate iterative algorithm however none exist iterative algorithms feature time fast convergence low computational complexity per iteration guarantee convergence reason recently definition geometric mean base symmetric divergence measure bhattacharyya divergence consider resulting mean although possibly useful practice satisfy desirable invariance property paper consider geometric mean co-variance matrix estimate high-dimensional time-series assume data generate accord instantaneous mixing model common signal processing show circumstance approximate fisher information geometric mean employ efficient ajd algorithm approximation general much closer fisher information geometric mean compare competitor verifies many invariance property furthermore convergence guarantee computational complexity low convergence rate quadratic accuracy new geometric mean approximation demonstrate mean simulation
