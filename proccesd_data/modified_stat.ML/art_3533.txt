 optimal subsampling approach large sample linear regression significant hurdle analyze large sample data lack effective statistical computing inference method emerge powerful approach analyze large sample data subsampling one take random subsample original full sample use surrogate subsequent computation estimation paper study subsampling method two scenario approximate full sample ordinary least-square ols estimator estimate coefficient linear regression present two algorithm weighted estimation algorithm unweighted estimation algorithm analyze asymptotic behavior resulting subsample estimator general condition weighted estimation algorithm propose criterion select optimal sampling probability make use asymptotic result basis criterion provide two novel subsampling method optimal subsampling predictor- length subsampling method predictor-length subsampling method base l norm predictor rather leverage score computational cost scalable unweighted estimation algorithm show result subsample estimator consistent full sample ols estimator however good performance weighted estimation algorithm estimate coefficient simulation study real data example use demonstrate effectiveness propose subsampling method
