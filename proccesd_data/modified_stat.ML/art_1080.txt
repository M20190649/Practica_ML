 mixed membership symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization problem find overlap community network gain much attention recently optimization-based approach use non-negative matrix factorization nmf variant global optimum provably attain general model-based approach popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel mmsb airoldi et al. use parameter node specify overlapping community standard inference technique guarantee consistency link two approach establish sufficient condition symmetric nmf optimization unique solution mmsb b propose computationally efficient algorithm call geonmf provably optimal hence consistent broad parameter regime demonstrate accuracy simulate real-world datasets
