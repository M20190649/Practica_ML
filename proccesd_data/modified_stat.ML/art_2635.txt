 summary statistic partitioning feature allocation infinite mixture model commonly use cluster one sample posterior mixture assignment monte carlo method find maximum posteriori solution optimization however problem posterior diffuse hard interpret sampled partitioning paper introduce novel statistic base block size represent sample set partitioning feature allocation develop element-based definition entropy quantify segmentation among element propose simple algorithm call entropy agglomeration ea summarize visualize information experiment various infinite mixture posterior well feature allocation dataset demonstrate propose statistic useful practice
