 bayesian network structure learn permutation test literature several study performance bayesian network structure learn algorithm focus study almost always heuristic learning algorithm base i.e maximisation algorithm score-based algorithm technique learn dependency variable constraint-based algorithm paper investigate use permutation test instead parametric one affect performance bayesian network structure learn discrete data shrinkage test also cover provide broad overview technique develop current literature
