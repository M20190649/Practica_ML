 homotopy continuation approach robust sv classification regression support vector machine svm application unreliable data contain portion outlier non-robustness svms often cause considerable performance deterioration although many approach improve robustness svms study two major challenge remain robust svm learning first robust learning algorithm essentially formulate non-convex optimization problem thus important develop non-convex optimization method robust svm find good local optimal solution second practical issue one tune hyperparameter control balance robustness efficiency unfortunately due non-convexity robust svm solution slightly different hyper-parameter value significantly different make model selection highly unstable paper address two issue simultaneously introduce novel homotopy approach non-convex robust svm learning basic idea introduce parametrized formulation robust svm bridge standard svm fully robust svm via parameter represent influence outlier characterize necessary sufficient condition local optimal solution robust svm develop algorithm trace path local optimal solution influence outlier gradually decrease advantage homotopy approach interpret simulated annealing common approach find good local optimal solution non-convex optimization problem addition homotopy method allow stable efficient model selection base path local optimal solution empirical performance propose approach demonstrate intensive numerical experiment robust classification regression problem
