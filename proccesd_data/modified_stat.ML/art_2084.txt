 learn mixture spherical gaussians moment method spectral decomposition work provide computationally efficient statistically consistent moment-based estimator mixture spherical gaussians condition component mean general position simple spectral decomposition technique yield consistent parameter estimate low-order observable moment without additional minimum separation assumption need previous computationally efficient estimation procedure thus computational information-theoretic barrier efficient estimation mixture model preclude mixture component mean general position spherical covariance connection make estimation problem relate independent component analysis
