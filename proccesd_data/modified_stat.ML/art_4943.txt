 efficient character-level neural machine translation neural machine translation aim build single large neural network train maximize translation performance encoder-decoder architecture attention mechanism achieve translation performance comparable exist state-of-the-art phrase-based system task english-to-french translation however use large vocabulary become bottleneck training improve performance paper propose efficient architecture train deep character-level neural machine translation introduce decimator interpolator decimator use sample source sequence encode interpolator use resample decode deep model two major advantage avoid large vocabulary issue radically time much fast memory-efficient training conventional character-based model interestingly model able translate misspelled word like human being
