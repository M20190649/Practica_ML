 blind image denoising via dependent dirichlet process tree existing image denoising approach assume noise homogeneous white gaussian distribute known intensity however real noisy image noise model usually unknown beforehand much complex paper address problem propose novel blind image denoising algorithm recover clean image noisy one unknown noise model model empirical noise image method introduce mixture gaussian distribution flexible enough approximate different continuous distribution problem blind image denoising reformulate learning problem procedure first build two-layer structural model noisy patch consider clean one latent variable control complexity noisy patch model work propose novel bayesian nonparametric prior call dependent dirichlet process tree build model study derive variational inference algorithm estimate model parameter recover clean patch apply method synthesis real noisy image different noise model compare previous approach achieves good performance experimental result indicate efficiency propose algorithm cope practical image denoising task
