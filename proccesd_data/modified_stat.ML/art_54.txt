 classification set cover prototype vector machine introduce new nearest-prototype classifier prototype vector machine pvm arise combinatorial optimization problem cast variant set cover problem propose two algorithm approximate solution pvm select relatively small number representative point use classification contain -nn special case method compatible dissimilarity measure make amenable situation data embed underlying feature space use non-euclidean metric desirable indeed demonstrate much study zip code data pvm reap benefit problem-specific metric example pvm outperform highly successful -nn tangent distance retain few half data point example highlight strength pvm yield low-error highly interpretable model additionally apply pvm protein classification problem kernel-based distance use
