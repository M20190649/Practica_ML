 data-driven learning number state multi-state autoregressive model work consider class multi-state autoregressive process use model non-stationary time-series interest order capture different autoregressive ar state underlie observed time series crucial select appropriate number state propose new model selection technique base gap statistic use null reference distribution stable ar filter check whether add new ar state significantly improve performance model end define new distance measure ar filter base mean square prediction error mspe propose efficient method generate random stable filter uniformly distribute coefficient space numerical result provide evaluate performance propose approach
