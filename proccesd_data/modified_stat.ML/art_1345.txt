 learn graph monotone topology property multiple connected component recent paper formulate problem learn graph data inverse covariance estimation graph laplacian constraint problem convex exist method guarantee solution specific graph topology property e.g. k -partite desirable application fact problem learn graph give topology property e.g. find k -partite graph best match data general non-convex paper develop novel theoretical result provide performance guarantee approach solve problem solution decompose problem two sub-problems efficient solution know specifically graph topology inference gti step employ select feasible graph topology i.e. one desired property graph weight estimation gwe step perform solve generalized graph laplacian estimation problem edge constrain topology find gti step main result bound error gwe step function error gti step error bound indicate gti step solve use algorithm approximate similarity matrix another matrix whose entry thresholded zero desire type graph topology gti stage leverage exist method e.g. state art approach graph coloring typically base minimize total weight remove edge since gwe stage formulate inverse covariance estimation problem linear constraint solve use exist convex optimization method demonstrate two step approach achieve good result synthetic texture image data
