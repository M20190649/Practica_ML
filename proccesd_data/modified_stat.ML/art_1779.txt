 statistical topic model multi-label document classification machine learn approach multi-label document classification date largely rely discriminative model technique support vector machine drawback approach performance rapidly drop total number label number label per document increase problem amplify label frequency exhibit type highly skewed distribution often observe real-world datasets paper investigate class generative statistical topic model multi-label document associate individual word tokens different label investigate advantage approach relative discriminative model particularly respect classification problem involve large number relatively rare label compare performance generative discriminative approach document label task range datasets several thousand label datasets ten label experimental result indicate probabilistic generative model achieve competitive multi-label classification performance compare discriminative method advantage datasets many label skew label frequency
