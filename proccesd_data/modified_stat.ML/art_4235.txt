 reexamine low rank matrix factorization trace norm regularization trace norm regularization widely use approach learn low rank matrix standard optimization strategy base formulate problem one low rank matrix factorization however lead non-convex problem practice approach work well often computationally faster standard convex solver proximal gradient method nevertheless guarantee converge global optimum optimization trap poor stationary point paper show possible characterize critical point non-convex problem allow u provide efficient criterion determine whether critical point also global minimizer analysis suggest iterative meta-algorithm dynamically expand parameter space allow optimization escape non-global critical point thereby converge global minimizer algorithm apply problem matrix completion multitask learning analysis hold random initialization factor matrix finally confirm good performance algorithm synthetic real datasets
