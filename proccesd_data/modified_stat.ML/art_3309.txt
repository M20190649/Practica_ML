 probabilistic clustering time-evolving distance data present novel probabilistic clustering model object represent via pairwise distance observe different time point propose method utilize information give adjacent time point find underlying cluster structure obtain smooth cluster evolution approach allow number object cluster differ every time point identification identity object need model require number cluster specify advance -- instead determine automatically use dirichlet process prior validate model synthetic data show propose method accurate state-of-the-art cluster method finally use dynamic cluster model analyze illustrate evolution brain cancer patient time
