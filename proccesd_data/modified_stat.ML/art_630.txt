 equivalence factorized information criterion regularization chinese restaurant process prior factorize information criterion fic recently develop information criterion base novel model selection methodology namely factorize asymptotic bayesian fab inference develop successfully apply various hierarchical bayesian model dirichlet process dp prior one well know representation chinese restaurant process crp derive another line model selection method fic view prior distribution latent variable configuration view prove parameter dimensionality c fic equivalent crp argue c fic avoids inherent problem dp crp i.e data likelihood dominate impact prior thus model selection capability weaken c increase however fic overestimate data likelihood result fic may overly bias towards model less component propose natural generalization fic find middle ground crp fic may yield accurate model selection result fic
