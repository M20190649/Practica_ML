 inverse density inverse problem fredholm equation approach paper address problem estimate ratio frac q p p density function q another density generally arbitrary function know approximate ratio need various problem inference integration particular one need average function respect one probability distribution give sample another often refer importance sample statistical inference also closely relate problem covariate shift transfer learning well various mcmc method may also useful separate underlying geometry space say manifold density function define approach base reformulate problem estimate frac q p inverse problem term integral operator correspond kernel thus reduce integral equation know fredholm problem first kind formulation combine technique regularization kernel method lead principled kernel-based framework construct algorithm analyze theoretically result family algorithms fire fredholm inverse regularize estimator flexible simple easy implement provide detailed theoretical analysis include concentration bound convergence rate gaussian kernel case density define r compact domain r smooth -dimensional sub-manifolds euclidean space also show experimental result include application classification semi-supervised learning within covariate shift framework demonstrate encouraging experimental comparison also show parameter algorithm choose completely unsupervised manner
