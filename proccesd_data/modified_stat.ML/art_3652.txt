 efficient output kernel learn multiple task paradigm multi-task learning one achieve good generalization learn task jointly thus exploit similarity task rather learn independently previously relationship task user-defined form output kernel recent approach jointly learn task output kernel output kernel positive semidefinite matrix result optimization problem scalable number task eigendecomposition require step mbox use theory positive semidefinite kernel show paper certain class regularizers output kernel constraint positive semidefinite drop automatically satisfy relaxed problem lead unconstrained dual problem solve efficiently experiment several multi-task multi-class data set illustrate efficacy approach term computational efficiency well generalization performance
