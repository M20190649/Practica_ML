 tree space prototype another look make tree ensemble interpretable ensemble decision tree good prediction accuracy suffer lack interpretability propose new approach interpret tree ensemble find prototype tree space utilize naturally-learned similarity measure tree ensemble demonstrate method random forest show method benefit unique aspect tree ensemble leverage tree structure sequentially find prototype method provide good prediction accuracy find prototype use nearest-prototype classifier use few prototype competitor method investigate sensitivity method different prototype-finding procedure demonstrate higher-dimensional data
