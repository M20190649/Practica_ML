 simultaneous safe screening feature sample doubly sparse model problem learn sparse model conceptually interpret process identify active feature sample optimize model recently introduce safe screening allow u identify part non-active feature sample far safe screening individually study either feature screening sample screening paper introduce new approach safely screen feature sample simultaneously alternatively iterating feature sample screen step significant advantage consider simultaneously rather individually synergy effect sense result previous safe feature screening exploit improve next safe sample screen performance vice-versa first theoretically investigate synergy effect illustrate practical advantage intensive numerical experiment problem large number feature sample
