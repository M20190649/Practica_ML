 mind nuisance gaussian process classification use privileged noise learning privileged information setting recently attract lot attention within machine learn community allow integration additional knowledge training process classifier even come form data modality available test time show privileged information naturally treat noise latent function gaussian process classifier gpc contrast standard gpc setting latent function nuisance feature become natural measure confidence training data modulate slope gpc sigmoid likelihood function extensive experiment public datasets show propose gpc method use privileged noise call gpc improve standard gpc without privileged knowledge also current state-of-the-art svm-based method svm moreover show advanced neural network deep learning method compress privileged information
