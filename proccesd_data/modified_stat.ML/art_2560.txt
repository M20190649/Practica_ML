 mcmc learn theory learn uniform distribution rich deep connection cryptography computational complexity analysis boolean function name area theory however limited due fact uniform distribution corresponding fourier basis rarely encounter statistical model family distribution vastly generalize uniform distribution boolean cube distribution represent markov random field mrf markov random field one main tool model high dimensional data many area statistic machine learning paper initiate investigation extend central idea method algorithm theory learn uniform distribution setup learn concept give example mrf distribution particular result establish novel connection property mcmc sampling mrfs learn mrf distribution
