 excess risk bound exponentially concave loss overarch goal paper derive excess risk bound learn exp-concave loss function passive sequential learning setting exp-concave loss function encompass several fundamental problem machine learning squared loss linear regression logistic loss classification negative logarithm loss portfolio management batch setting obtain sharp bound performance empirical risk minimization perform linear hypothesis space respect exp-concave loss function also extend result online set learner receive training example sequential manner propose online learn algorithm properly modify version online newton method obtain sharp risk bound additional mild assumption loss function show setting able achieve excess risk bound log n n hold high probability
