 equivalence lasso support vector machine investigate relation two fundamental tool machine learning signal processing support vector machine svm classification lasso technique use regression show result optimization problem equivalent following sense give instance ell -loss soft-margin hard-margin svm construct lasso instance optimal solution vice versa consequence many exist optimization algorithm svms lasso also apply respective problem instance also equivalence allow many know theoretical insight svm lasso translate two setting one implication give simple kernelized version lasso analogous kernel use svm setting another consequence sparsity lasso solution equal number support vector corresponding svm instance one use screen rule prune set support vector furthermore relate sublinear time algorithm two problem give new algorithm variant lasso also study regularization path method
