 population posterior bayesian inference stream many modern data analysis problem involve inference stream data however stream data easily amenable standard probabilistic modeling approach assume condition finite data develop population variational bayes new approach use bayesian modeling analyze stream data approximate new type distribution population posterior combine notion population distribution data bayesian inference probabilistic model study method latent dirichlet allocation dirichlet process mixture several large-scale data set
