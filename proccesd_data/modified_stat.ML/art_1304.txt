 co-clustering optimal transport paper present novel method co-clustering unsupervised learning approach aim discover homogeneous group data instance feature group simultaneously propose method use entropy regularize optimal transport empirical measure define data instance feature order obtain estimate joint probability density function represent optimal coupling matrix matrix factorize obtain induced row column partition use multiscale representation approach justify method theoretically show solution regularize optimal transport see variational inference perspective thus motivate use co-clustering algorithm derive propose method kernelized version base notion gromov-wasserstein distance fast accurate determine automatically number row column cluster feature vividly demonstrate extensive experimental evaluation
