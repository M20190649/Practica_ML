 chain gaussian process gaussian process model flexible bayesian non-parametric approach regression property multivariate gaussians mean combine linearly manner additive model via link function like generalized linear model handle non-gaussian data however link function formalism restrictive link function always invertible must convert parameter interest linear combination underlying process many likelihood model non-linear combination appropriate term general model chain gaussian process transformation gps likelihood parameter generally invertible implies linearisation would possible multiple localized link i.e chain develop approximate inference procedure chained gps scalable applicable factorized likelihood demonstrate approximation range likelihood function
