 multi-label learning via structured decomposition group sparsity multi-label learning sample associate several label exist work indicate explore correlation label improve prediction performance however embed label correlation training process significantly increase problem size moreover mapping label structure feature space clear paper propose novel multi-label learn method structured decomposition group sparsity sdgs sdgs learn feature subspace label structured decomposition training data predict label new sample group sparse representation multi-subspace obtain structured decomposition particular training stage decompose data matrix x r n time p x sum kl wherein row l associate sample belong label nonzero consist low-rank matrix row all-zeros residual sparse matrix row space l feature subspace correspond label decomposition efficiently obtain via randomized optimization prediction stage estimate group sparse representation new sample multi-subspace via group emph lasso nonzero representation coefficient tend concentrate subspace label sample belongs thus effective prediction obtain evaluate sdgs several real datasets compare popular method result verify effectiveness efficiency sdgs
