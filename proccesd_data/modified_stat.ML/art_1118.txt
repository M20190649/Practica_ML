 randomized approach efficient kernel cluster kernel-based k-means cluster gain popularity due simplicity power implicit non-linear representation data dominant concern memory requirement since memory scale square number data point provide new analysis class approximate kernel method modest memory requirement propose specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation follow standard k-means transform data analysis experiment suggest method accurate require drastically less memory standard kernel k-means significantly less memory nystrom base approximation
