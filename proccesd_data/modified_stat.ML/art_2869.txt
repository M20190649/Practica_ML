 separable cosparse analysis operator learn ability sparse representation certain class signal many application data analysis image processing research field among sparse representation cosparse analysis model recently gain increase interest many signal exhibit multidimensional structure e.g image three-dimensional mri scan data analysis learn algorithm use vectorized signal thereby account underlying structure drawback take inherent structure account dramatic increase computational cost propose algorithm learn cosparse analysis operator adhere preexisting structure data thus allows efficient implementation achieve enforce separable structure learn operator learn algorithm able deal multidimensional data arbitrary order evaluate method volumetric data example three-dimensional mri scan
