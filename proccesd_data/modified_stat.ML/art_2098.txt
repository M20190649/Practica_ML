 online bandit learn adaptive adversary regret policy regret online learn algorithm design learn even input generate adversary widely-accepted formal definition online algorithm 's ability learn game-theoretic notion regret argue standard definition regret becomes inadequate adversary allow adapt online algorithm 's action define alternative notion policy regret attempt provide meaningful way measure online algorithm 's performance adaptive adversary focus online bandit setting show bandit algorithm guarantee sublinear policy regret adaptive adversary unbounded memory hand adversary 's memory bound present general technique convert bandit algorithm sublinear regret bound algorithm sublinear policy regret bound extend result variant regret switch regret internal regret swap regret
