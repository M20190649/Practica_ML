 learn nonparametric differential equation operator-valued kernel gradient match model dynamical system ordinary differential equation imply mechanistic view process underlie dynamic however many case knowledge available overcome issue introduce general framework nonparametric ode model use penalized regression reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhs base operator-valued kernel moreover extend scope gradient match approach nonparametric ode smooth estimate solution ode build provide approximation derivative ode solution turn use learn nonparametric ode model approach benefit flexibility penalized regression rkhs allow ridge structured sparse regression well good result show different ode system
