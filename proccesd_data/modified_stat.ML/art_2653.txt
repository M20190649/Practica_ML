 bayes-optimality f-measure maximizers f-measure originally introduce information retrieval nowadays routinely use performance metric problem binary classification multi-label classification structure output prediction optimize measure statistically computationally challenge problem since closed-form solution exists adopt decision-theoretic perspective article provide formal experimental analysis different approach maximize f-measure start bayes-risk analysis related loss function hamming loss subset zero-one loss show optimize loss surrogate f-measure lead high worst-case regret subsequently perform similar type analysis f-measure maximizing algorithm show algorithm approximate rely additional assumption regard statistical distribution binary response variable furthermore present new algorithm computationally efficient also bayes-optimal regardless underlying distribution end algorithm require quadratic respect number binary response number parameter joint distribution illustrate practical performance analyze method mean experiment multi-label classification problem
