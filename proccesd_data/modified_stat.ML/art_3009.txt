 hamiltonian monte carlo without detailed balance present method perform hamiltonian monte carlo largely eliminate sample rejection typical hyperparameters situation would normally lead rejection instead longer trajectory compute new state reach accept achieve use markov chain transition satisfy fixed point equation satisfy detailed balance result algorithm significantly suppress random walk behavior wasted function evaluation typically consequence update rejection demonstrate great factor two improvement mix time three test problem release source code python matlab package
