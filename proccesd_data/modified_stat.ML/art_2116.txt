 exact maximum margin structure learning bayesian network recently much interest find globally optimal bayesian network structure technique develop generative score directly extend discriminative score desire classification paper propose exact method find network structure maximize probabilistic soft margin successfully apply discriminative score method base branch-and-bound technique within linear programming framework maintain any-time solution together worst-case sub-optimality bound apply set order constraint enforce network structure acyclic allow compact problem representation use general-purpose optimization technique classification experiment method clearly outperform generatively trained network structure compete support vector machine
