 fast reinforcement learn large action set use error-correcting output code mdp factorization use reinforcement learning real-world scenario strongly limit issue scale rl learning algorithm unable deal problem compose hundred sometimes even dozen possible action therefore apply many real-world problem consider rl problem supervised classification framework optimal policy obtain multiclass classifier set class set action problem introduce error-correcting output code ecocs setting propose two new method reduce complexity use rollouts-based approach first method consist use ecoc-based classifier multiclass classifier reduce learn complexity alog propose novel method profit ecoc 's cod dictionary split initial mdp log seperate two-action mdps second method reduces learn complexity even log thus render problem large action set tractable finish experimentally demonstrate advantage approach set benchmark problem speed performance
