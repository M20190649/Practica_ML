 semi-supervised classification bag-of-paths group betweenness paper introduce novel well-founded betweenness measure call bag-of-paths bop betweenness well extension bop group betweenness tackle semisupervised classification problem weighted direct graph objective semi-supervised classification assign label unlabeled node use whole topology graph labeled node disposal bop betweenness relies bag-of-paths framework assign boltzmann distribution set possible path network long high-cost path low probability pick bag short low-cost path high probability pick within context bop betweenness node j define sum posteriori probability node j lie in-between two arbitrary node k pick path start end k. intuitively node typically receive high betweenness large probability appear path connect two arbitrary node network quantity compute closed form invert n x n matrix n number node group betweenness path constrain start end node within class therefore define group betweenness class unlabeled node classified accord class show high group betweenness experiment various real-world data set show bop group betweenness outperform tested state of-the-art method benefit bop betweenness particularly noticeable labeled node available
