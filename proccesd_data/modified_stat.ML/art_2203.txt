 oracle inequality computationally adaptive model selection analyze general model selection procedure use penalized empirical loss minimization computational constraint classical model selection approach consider computational aspect perform model selection argue practical model selection procedure must trade estimation approximation error also computational effort require compute empirical minimizers different function class provide framework analyze problem give algorithm model selection computational budget algorithms satisfy oracle inequality show risk select model much bad devote omputational budget optimal function class
