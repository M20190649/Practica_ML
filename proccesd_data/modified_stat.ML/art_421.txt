 nonparametric independence test small sample size paper deal problem nonparametric independence testing fundamental decision-theoretic problem ask two arbitrary possibly multivariate random variable x independent question come many field like causality neuroscience quantity like correlation x test univariate linear independence natural alternative like mutual information x hard estimate due serious curse dimensionality recent approach avoid issue estimate norm textit operator reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhss main contribution strong empirical evidence employ textit shrunk operator sample size small one attain improvement power low false positive rate analyze effect stein shrinkage popular test statistic call hsic hilbert-schmidt independence criterion observation provide insight two recently propose shrinkage estimator scose fcose prove scose essentially optimal linear shrinkage method textit estimate true operator however non-linearly shrunk fcose usually achieve great improvement textit test power work important powerful nonparametric detection subtle nonlinear dependency small sample
