 variational bayes merge noisy database bayesian entity resolution merge together multiple noisy database return minimal collection unique individual represent together true latent record value bayesian method allow flexible generative model share power across databases well principled quantification uncertainty query final resolved database however exist bayesian method entity resolution use markov monte carlo method mcmc approximation slow run modern database contain million billion record instead propose apply variational approximation allow scalable bayesian inference model derive coordinate-ascent approximation mean-field variational bayes qualitatively compare algorithm exist method note unique challenge inference arise expected distribution cluster size entity resolution discuss direction future work domain
