 wasserstein auto-encoders propose wasserstein auto-encoder wae -- -a new algorithm build generative model data distribution wae minimize penalized form wasserstein distance model distribution target distribution lead different regularizer one use variational auto-encoder vae regularizer encourage encoded training distribution match prior compare algorithm several technique show generalization adversarial auto-encoders aae experiment show wae share many property vaes stable training encoder-decoder architecture nice latent manifold structure generate sample good quality measure fid score
