 asymptotic analysis objective base fisher information active learning obtain label costly time-consuming active learning allow learning algorithm intelligently query sample label efficient learning fisher information ratio fir use objective select query active learning however little know theory behind use fir active learning gap underlie theory motivation usage practice paper attempt fill gap provide rigorous framework analyze exist fir-based active learning method particular show fir asymptotically view upper bound expected variance log-likelihood ratio additionally analysis suggest unifying framework enable u make theoretical comparison among exist query method base fir also allow u give insight development new active learning approach base objective
