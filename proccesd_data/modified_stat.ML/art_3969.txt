 socratic learning augment generative model incorporate latent subset train data challenge train discriminative model like neural network obtain enough label training data recent approach use generative model combine weak supervision source like user-defined heuristic knowledge base label training data prior work explore learn accuracy source even without ground truth label assume single accuracy parameter sufficient model behavior source entire training set particular fail model latent subset training data supervision source perform differently average present socratic learning paradigm use feedback corresponding discriminative model automatically identify subset augment structure generative model accordingly experimentally show without ground truth label augmented generative model reduces error relation extraction task compare state-of-the-art weak supervision technique utilize generative model
