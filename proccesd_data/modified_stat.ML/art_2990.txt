 property neural machine translation encoder-decoder approach neural machine translation relatively new approach statistical machine translation base purely neural network neural machine translation model often consist encoder decoder encoder extract fixed-length representation variable-length input sentence decoder generate correct translation representation paper focus analyze property neural machine translation use two model rnn encoder -- decoder newly propose gate recursive convolutional neural network show neural machine translation performs relatively well short sentence without unknown word performance degrades rapidly length sentence number unknown word increase furthermore find propose gated recursive convolutional network learn grammatical structure sentence automatically
