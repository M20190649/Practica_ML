 multivariate comparison classification algorithms statistical test compare classification algorithm univariate use single performance measure e.g. misclassification error f measure auc multivariate test comparison do use multiple measure simultaneously example error sum false positive false negative univariate test error make distinction two source -variate test similarly instead combine precision recall f measure -variate test precision recall use hotelling 's multivariate test compare two algorithm three algorithm use multivariate analysis variance manova follow pairwise post hoc test experiment see multivariate test high power univariate test detect difference univariate test also discuss multivariate analysis allow u automatically extract performance measure best distinguish behavior multiple algorithm
