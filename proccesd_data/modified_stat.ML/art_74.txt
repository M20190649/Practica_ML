 multi-way multi-view learning extend multi-way multivariate anova-type analysis case one covariate view feature view come different high-dimensional domain different view assume connect pair sample common setup recent bioinformatics experiment analyze metabolite profile different condition disease vs. control treatment vs. untreated different tissue view introduce multi-way latent variable model new task extend generative model bayesian canonical correlation analysis cca take multi-way covariate information account population prior reduce dimensionality integrated factor analysis assume metabolite come correlated group
