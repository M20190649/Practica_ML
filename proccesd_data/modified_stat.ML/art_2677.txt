 center binary deep boltzmann machine work analyzes center binary restricted boltzmann machine rbms binary deep boltzmann machine dbms centering do subtract offset value visible hidden variable show analytically center result different equivalent parameterization artificial neural network general ii expected performance centered binary rbms dbms invariant simultaneous flip data offset offset value range zero one iii center reformulate different update rule normal binary rbms dbms iv use enhanced gradient equivalent set offset value average model data mean furthermore numerical simulation suggest optimal generative performance achieve subtract mean value visible well hidden variable ii center rbms dbms reach significantly high log-likelihood value normal binary rbms dbms iii center variant whose offset depend model mean like enhanced gradient suffer severe divergence problem iv learning stabilize exponentially moving average batch mean use offset value instead current batch mean also prevent enhanced gradient diverge v center rbms dbms reach high value normal rbms dbms small norm weight matrix vi center lead update direction close natural gradient natural gradient extremly efficient train rbms vii center dispense need greedy layer-wise pre-training dbms viii furthermore show pre-training often even worsen result independently whether centering use ix centering also beneficial auto encoders
