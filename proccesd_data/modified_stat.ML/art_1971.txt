 generalized kernel approach structure output learn study problem structured output learn regression perspective first provide general formulation kernel dependency estimation kde problem use operator-valued kernel show exist formulation problem special case framework propose covariance-based operator-valued kernel allow u take account structure kernel feature space kernel operate output space encode interaction output without reference input space address issue introduce variant kde method base conditional covariance operator addition correlation output take account effect input variable finally evaluate performance kde approach use covariance conditional covariance kernel two structured output problem compare state-of-the-art kernel-based structure output regression method
