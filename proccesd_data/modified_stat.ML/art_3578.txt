 definiteness earth mover 's distance relation set intersection positive definite kernel important tool machine learning enable efficient solution otherwise difficult intractable problem implicitly linearize problem geometry paper develop set-theoretic interpretation earth mover 's distance emd propose earth mover 's intersection emi positive definite analog emd set different size provide condition emd certain approximation emd negative definite also present positive-definite-preserving transformation apply kernel also use derive positive definite emd-based kernel show jaccard index simply result transformation finally evaluate kernel base emi propose transformation versus emd various computer vision task show emd generally inferior even indefinite kernel technique
