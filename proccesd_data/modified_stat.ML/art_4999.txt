 iteratively reweighted least square algorithms l -norm principal component analysis principal component analysis pca often use reduce dimension data select orthonormal vector explain variance structure data l pca use l norm measure error whereas conventional pca use l norm l pca problem minimize fitting error reconstruct data propose exact reweighted approximate algorithm base iteratively reweighted least square provide convergence analysis compare performance benchmark algorithm literature computational experiment show propose algorithm consistently perform best
