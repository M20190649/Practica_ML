 structure stochastic linear bandits stochastic linear bandit problem proceeds round round algorithm select vector decision set receive noisy linear loss parameterized unknown vector goal problem minimize pseudo regret difference total expected loss algorithm total expected loss best fixed vector hindsight paper consider setting unknown parameter structure e.g. sparse group sparse low-rank capture norm e.g. l l nuclear norm focus construct confidence ellipsoid contain unknown parameter across round high-probability show radius ellipsoid depend gaussian width set associate norm capture structure characterization lead tighter confidence ellipsoid therefore sharp regret bound compare bound exist literature base ambient dimensionality
