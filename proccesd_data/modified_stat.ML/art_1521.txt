 gaussian process classification privileged information soft-to-hard labeling transfer learn use privileged information attractive problem set help many learn scenario real world state-of-the-art method gaussian process classification gpc privileged information gpc incorporate privileged information noise term likelihood drawback gpc require numerical quadrature calculate posterior distribution latent function extremely time-consuming overcome limitation propose novel classification method privilege information base gaussian process call soft-label-transferred gaussian process slt-gp basic idea construct another learn task predict soft label continuous value obtain privilege information perform transfer learn task target task predict hard label derive pac-bayesian bound propose method justify optimize hyperparameters empirical bayes method also experimentally show usefulness propose method compare gpc gpc
