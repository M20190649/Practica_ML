 convergence em algorithm gaussian mixture unbalanced mix coefficient speed convergence expectation maximization em algorithm gaussian mixture model fitting know dependent amount overlap among mixture component paper study impact mix coefficient convergence em show mixture component exhibit overlap convergence em becomes slower dynamic range among mix coefficient increase propose deterministic anti-annealing algorithm significantly improve speed convergence em mixture unbalanced mix coefficient propose algorithm compare standard optimization technique like bfgs conjugate gradient traditional em algorithm finally propose similar deterministic anti-annealing base algorithm dirichlet process mixture model demonstrate advantage conventional variational bayesian approach
