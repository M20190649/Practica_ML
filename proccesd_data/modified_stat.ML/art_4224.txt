 unified analysis stochastic optimization method use jump system theory quadratic constraint develop simple routine unify analysis several important recently-developed stochastic optimization method include saga finito stochastic dual coordinate ascent sdca first show intrinsic connection stochastic optimization method dynamic jump system propose general jump system model stochastic optimization method propose model recovers saga sdca finito sag special case combine jump system theory several simple quadratic inequality derive sufficient condition convergence rate certification propose jump system model various assumption without individual convexity etc derived condition linear matrix inequality lmis whose size roughly scale size training set make use symmetry stochastic optimization method reduce lmis equivalent small lmis whose size solve small lmis provide analytical proof new convergence rate saga finito sdca without individual convexity also explain propose lmi fail analyze sag reveal key difference sag method briefly discuss extend lmi analysis sag advantage approach propose analysis automate large class stochastic method various assumption without individual convexity etc
