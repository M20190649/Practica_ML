 robustness kernel cluster clustering one important unsupervised problem machine learning statistic among many exist algorithm kernel k-means draw much research attention due ability find non-linear cluster boundary inherent simplicity two main approach kernel k-means svd kernel matrix convex relaxation despite attention kernel clustering receive theoretical applied quarter much know robustness method paper first introduce semidefinite programming relaxation kernel clustering problem prove suitable model specification k-svd sdp approach consistent limit albeit sdp strongly consistent i.e achieves exact recovery whereas k-svd weakly consistent i.e fraction misclassified node vanish
