 towards neural statistician efficient learner one reuse already know tackle new problem machine learner mean understand similarity amongst datasets order one must take seriously idea work datasets rather datapoints key object model towards goal demonstrate extension variational autoencoder learn method compute representation statistic datasets unsupervised fashion network train produce statistic encapsulate generative model dataset hence network enable efficient learn new datasets unsupervised supervised task show able learn statistic use clustering datasets transfer generative model new datasets select representative sample datasets classify previously unseen class refer model neural statistician mean neural network learn compute summary statistic datasets without supervision
