 convex formulation kernel pca use semi-supervised learning paper kernel pca reinterpret solution convex optimization problem actually constrained convex problem principal component constraint guarantee principal component indeed solution mere saddle point although insight imply algorithmic improvement use understand method formulate possible extension properly address example new convex optimization problem semi-supervised classification propose seem particularly well-suited whenever number known label small formulation resemble least square svm problem regularization parameter multiply negative sign combine variational principle kernel pca primal optimization principle semi-supervised learning solve term lagrange multiplier numerical experiment several classification task illustrate performance propose model problem label data
