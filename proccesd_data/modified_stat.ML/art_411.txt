 cluster via mode seek direct estimation gradient log-density mean shift cluster find mode data probability density identify zero point density gradient since require fix number cluster advance mean shift popular clustering algorithm various application field typical implementation mean shift first estimate density kernel density estimation compute gradient however since good density estimation necessarily imply accurate estimation density gradient indirect two-step approach reliable paper propose method directly estimate gradient log-density without go density estimation propose method give global solution analytically thus computationally efficient develop mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm find mode density cluster mean shift one need set number cluster advance empirically show propose clustering method work much good mean shift especially high-dimensional data experimental result indicate propose method outperform exist cluster method
