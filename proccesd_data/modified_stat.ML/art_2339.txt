 dimension correction hierarchical latent class model model complexity important factor consider select among graphical model variable observe complexity model measure standard dimension i.e number independent parameter hidden variable present however standard dimension might longer appropriate one instead use effective dimension geiger et al paper concern computation effective dimension first present upper bound effective dimension latent class lc model bound tight computation easy consider generalization lc model call hierarchical latent class hlc model zhang show effective dimension hlc model obtain effective dimension related lc model also demonstrate empirically use effective dimension place standard dimension improve quality model learn data
