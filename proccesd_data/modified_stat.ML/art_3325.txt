 analysis nuclear norm regularization full-rank matrix completion paper provide theoretical analysis nuclear-norm regularized least square full-rank matrix completion although similar formulation examine previous study result unsatisfactory additive upper bound provide assumption top eigenspaces target matrix incoherent derive relative upper bound recover best low-rank approximation unknown matrix relative upper bound tight previous additive bound method mass target matrix concentrate top eigenspaces also implies perfect recovery low-rank analysis build upon optimality condition regularized formulation exist guarantee low-rank matrix completion best knowledge first time relative bound prove regularized formulation matrix completion
