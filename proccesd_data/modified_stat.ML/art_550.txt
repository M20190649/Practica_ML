 predictive entropy search bayesian optimization unknown constraint unknown constraint arise many type expensive black-box optimization problem several method propose recently perform bayesian optimization constraint base expected improvement ei heuristic however ei lead pathology use constraint example case decoupled constraint -- -i.e. one independently evaluate objective constraint -- -ei encounter pathology prevent exploration additionally compute ei require current best solution may exist none data collect far satisfy constraint contrast information-based approach suffer failure mode paper present new information-based method call predictive entropy search constraint pesc analyze performance pesc show compare favorably ei-based approach synthetic benchmark problem well several real-world example demonstrate pesc effective algorithm provide promising direction towards unified solution constrained bayesian optimization
