 resizable mini-batch gradient descent base multi-armed bandit determine appropriate batch size mini-batch gradient descent always time consume often rely grid search paper consider resizable mini-batch gradient descent rmgd algorithm base multi-armed bandit achieve best performance grid search select appropriate batch size epoch probability define function previous success failure probability encourage exploration different batch size late exploitation batch size history success epoch rmgd sample batch size probability distribution use select batch size mini-batch gradient descent obtain validation loss epoch probability distribution update incorporate effectiveness sampled batch size rmgd essentially assist learning process explore possible domain batch size exploit successful batch size experimental result show rmgd achieve performance well best performing single batch size furthermore obviously attain performance shorter amount time grid search surprising rmgd achieve good performance grid search
