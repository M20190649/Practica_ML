 generalize spectral kernel paper propose family tractable kernel dense family bounded positive semi-definite function i.e approximate bounded kernel arbitrary precision start discuss case stationary kernel propose family spectral kernel extend exist approach spectral mixture kernel sparse spectrum kernel extension two primary advantage firstly unlike exist spectral approach yield infinite differentiability kernel introduce allow learn degree differentiability latent function gaussian process gp model function reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs kernel method secondly show kernel propose require few parameter exist spectral kernel accuracy thereby lead faster robust inference finally generalize approach propose flexible tractable family spectral kernel prove approximate continuous bound nonstationary kernel
