 efficiently bound optimal solution small data modification large-scale empirical risk minimization study large-scale classification problem change environment small part dataset modify effect data modification must quickly incorporate classifier entire dataset large even amount data modification fairly small computational cost re-training classifier would prohibitively large paper propose novel method efficiently incorporate data modification effect classifier without actually re-training propose method provide bound unknown optimal classifier cost proportional size data modification demonstrate numerical experiment propose method provide sufficiently tight bound negligible computational cost especially small part dataset modify large-scale classification problem
