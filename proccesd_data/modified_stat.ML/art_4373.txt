 morphnet fast simple resource-constrained structure learning deep network present morphnet approach automate design neural network structure morphnet iteratively shrink expand network shrink via resource-weighted sparsifying regularizer activation expand via uniform multiplicative factor layer contrast previous approach method scalable large network adaptable specific resource constraint e.g number floating-point operation per inference capable increase network 's performance apply standard network architecture wide variety datasets approach discovers novel structure domain obtain high performance respect resource constraint
