 lipschitz exploration-exploitation scheme bayesian optimization problem optimize unknown costly-to-evaluate function study long time context bayesian optimization algorithm field aim find optimizer function ask function evaluation location carefully select base posterior model paper assume unknown function lipschitz continuous leverage lipschitz property propose algorithm distinct exploration phase follow exploitation phase exploration phase aim select sample shrink search space much possible exploitation phase focus reduce search space selects sample closest optimizer consider expected improvement ei baseline empirically show propose algorithm significantly outperform ei
