 sparse duel bandits duel bandit problem variation classical multi-armed bandit allowable action noisy comparison pair arm paper focus new approach find best arm accord borda criterion use noisy comparison prove absence structural assumption sample complexity problem proportional sum inverse square gap borda score suboptimal arm best arm explore dependence consider structural constraint pairwise comparison matrix particular form sparsity natural problem significantly reduce sample complexity motivate new algorithm call successive elimination comparison sparsity secs exploit sparsity find borda winner use few sample standard algorithm also evaluate new algorithm experimentally synthetic real data result show sparsity model new algorithm provide significant improvement standard approach
