 active semi-supervised learning use sample theory graph signal consider problem offline pool-based active semi-supervised learning graph problem important label data scarce expensive whereas unlabeled data easily available data point represent vertex undirected graph similarity capture edge weight give target number node label goal choose node informative predict unknown label propose novel framework problem base recent result sample theory graph signal graph signal real-valued function define node graph notion frequency signal define use spectrum graph laplacian matrix sampling theory graph signal aim extend traditional nyquist-shannon sampling theory allow u identify class graph signal reconstruct value subset vertex approach allow u define criterion active learning base sample set selection aim maximize frequency signal reconstruct sample set experiment show effectiveness method
