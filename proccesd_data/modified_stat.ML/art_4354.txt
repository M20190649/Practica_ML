 variational bi-lstms recurrent neural network like long short-term memory lstm important architecture sequential prediction task lstms rnns general model sequence along forward time direction bidirectional lstms bi-lstms hand model sequence along forward backward direction generally know perform good task capture rich representation data training bi-lstms forward backward path learn independently propose variant bi-lstm architecture call variational bi-lstm create channel two path training may omit inference thus optimize two path jointly arrive joint objective model minimize variational low bound joint likelihood data sequence model act regularizer encourage two network inform make respective prediction use distinct information perform ablation study well understand different component model evaluate method various benchmark show state-of-the-art performance
