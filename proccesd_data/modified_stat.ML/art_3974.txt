 causal network learn multiple intervention unknown manipulated target paper discuss structure learning causal network multiple data set obtain external intervention experiment know variable manipulate example condition experiment change change temperature use drug know target variable manipulate external intervention data set structure learn becomes difficult case first discuss identifiability causal structure next present graph-merging method learn causal network case sample size large intervention case sample size intervention relatively small propose data-pooling method learn causal network pool data set intervention together learning propose re-sampling approach evaluate edge causal network learn data-pooling method finally illustrate propose learning method simulation
