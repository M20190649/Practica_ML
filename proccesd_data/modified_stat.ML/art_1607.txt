 penalize orthogonal-components regression large p small n data propose penalized orthogonal-components regression pocre large p small n data orthogonal component sequentially construct maximize upon standardization correlation response residual new penalization framework implement via empirical bayes thresholding present effectively identify sparse predictor component pocre computationally efficient owe sequential construction lead sparse principal component addition construction offer property group highly correlate predictor allow collinear nearly collinear predictor multivariate response pocre construct common component thus build latent-variable model large p small n data
