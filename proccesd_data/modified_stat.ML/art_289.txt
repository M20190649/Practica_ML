 group symmetry non-gaussian covariance estimation consider robust covariance estimation group symmetry constraint non-gaussian covariance estimation e.g. tyler scatter estimator multivariate generalize gaussian distribution method usually involve non-convex minimization problem recently show underlie principle behind success extended form convexity geodesic manifold positive definite matrix modern approach improve estimation accuracy exploit prior knowledge via additional constraint e.g. restrict attention specific class covariance adhere prior symmetry structure paper prove group symmetry constraint also geodesically convex therefore incorporate various non-gaussian covariance estimator practical example set include circulant persymmetric complex quaternion proper structure provide simple numerical technique find maximum likelihood estimate constraint demonstrate performance advantage use synthetic experiment
