 mixture sparse autoregressive network consider high-dimensional distribution estimation autoregressive network combine concept sparsity mixture parameter share obtain simple model fast train achieve state-of-the-art good result several standard benchmark datasets specifically use l -penalty regularize conditional distribution introduce procedure automatic parameter share mixture component moreover propose simple distribute representation permit exact likelihood evaluation since latent variable interleave observable variable easily integrate model achieve excellent generalization performance scale well extremely high dimension
