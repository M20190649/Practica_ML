 mean-field theory meta-learning discuss mean-field theory cellular automaton model meta-learning meta-learning process combine outcome individual learning procedure order determine final decision high accuracy single learning method method construct ensemble interacting learn agent acquire process incoming information use various type different version machine learn algorithm abstract learn space agent locate construct use fully connect model couple agent random strength value cellular automaton network simulate high level integration information acquire independent learning trial final classification incoming input data therefore define stationary state meta-learning system use simple majority rule yet minority cluster share opposite classification outcome observe system therefore probability select proper class give input data estimate even without prior knowledge affiliation fuzzy logic easily introduce system even learning agent build simple binary classification machine learn algorithm calculate percentage agree agent
