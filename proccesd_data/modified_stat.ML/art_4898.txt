 data filter cluster analysis ell -norm regularization data filtering method cluster analysis propose base minimize least squares function weighted ell -norm penalty overcome discontinuity objective function smooth non-convex function employ approximate ell -norm convergence global minimum point approximate problem towards global minimum point original problem state propose method also exploit suitable technique choose penalty parameter numerical result synthetic real data set finally provide show exist cluster method take advantage propose filtering strategy
