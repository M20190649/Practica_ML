 efficient learn robust gradient descent minimize empirical risk popular training strategy learn task data may noisy heavy-tailed one may require many observation order generalize well achieve good performance less stringent requirement introduce procedure construct robust approximation risk gradient use iterative learning routine use high-probability bound excess risk algorithm show update deviate far ideal gradient-based update empirical test use control simulation real-world benchmark data show diverse setting propose procedure learn efficiently use less resource iteration observation generalize good
