 metamodel-based importance sample simulation rare event field structural reliability monte-carlo estimator consider reference probability estimator however still untractable real engineering case since require high number run model order reduce number computer experiment many approach know reliability method propose certain approach consist replace original experiment surrogate much faster evaluate nevertheless often difficult even impossible quantify error make substitution paper alternative approach develop take advantage kriging meta-modeling importance sample technique propose alternative estimator finally apply finite element base structural reliability analysis
