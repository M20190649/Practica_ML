 component lasso propose new sparse regression method call component lasso base simple idea method use connected-components structure sample covariance matrix split problem small one solve subproblems separately obtain coefficient vector one use non-negative least square recombine different vector single solution step useful select reweighting component correlate response simulate real data example show component lasso outperform standard regression method lasso elastic net achieve low mean square error well good support recovery
