 safe screening rule sparse logistic regression l -regularized logistic regression sparse logistic regression widely use method simultaneous classification feature selection although many recent effort devote efficient implementation application high dimensional data still pose significant challenge paper present fast effective sparse logistic regression screen rule slores identify component solution vector may lead substantial reduction number feature enter optimization appealing feature slores data set need scan run screening computational cost negligible compare solve sparse logistic regression problem moreover slores independent solver sparse logistic regression thus slores integrate exist solver improve efficiency evaluate slores use high-dimensional data set different application extensive experimental result demonstrate slores outperform exist state-of-the-art screening rule efficiency solve sparse logistic regression improve one magnitude general
