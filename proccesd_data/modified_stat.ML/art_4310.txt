 interpretable vector autoregressions exogenous time series vector autoregressive var model fundamental study multivariate time series although var model intensively investigate many researcher practitioner often show interest analyze varx model incorporate impact unmodeled exogenous variable x var however since parameter space grow quadratically number time series estimation quickly become challenge several proposal make sparsely estimate large var model estimation large varx model under-explored moreover typically sparse proposal involve lasso-type penalty incorporate lag selection estimation procedure consequence result model may difficult interpret paper propose lag-based hierarchically sparse estimator call hvarx large varx model illustrate usefulness hvarx cross-category management marketing application result show provide highly interpretable model improve out-of-sample forecast accuracy compare lasso-type approach
