 partial membership latent dirichlet allocation topic model e.g. plsa lda slda widely use segment imagery model confine crisp segmentation yet many image region assign crisp label e.g. transition region foggy sky ground sand water beach case visual word best represent partial membership across multiple topic address present partial membership latent dirichlet allocation pm-lda model associate parameter estimation algorithm experimental result two natural image datasets one sonar image dataset show pm-lda produce crisp soft semantic image segmentation capability exist method
