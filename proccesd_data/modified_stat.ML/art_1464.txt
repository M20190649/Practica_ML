 denoising modulo sample function consider unknown smooth function f rightarrow mathbb r say give n noisy mod sample f i.e. f x eta mod x eta denotes noise give sample x n goal recover smooth robust estimate clean sample f x bmod formulate natural approach solve problem work representation mod value unit circle amount solve quadratically constrain quadratic program qcqp non-convex constraint involve point lie unit circle propose approach base solve relaxation trust-region sub-problem hence solvable efficiently demonstrate robustness noise approach via extensive simulation several synthetic example provide detailed theoretical analysis
