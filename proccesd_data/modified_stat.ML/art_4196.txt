 close look memorization deep network examine role memorization deep learning draw connection capacity generalization adversarial robustness deep network capable memorize noise data result suggest tend prioritize learn simple pattern first experiment expose qualitative difference gradient-based optimization deep neural network dnns noise vs. real data also demonstrate appropriately tune explicit regularization e.g. dropout degrade dnn train performance noise datasets without compromise generalization real data analysis suggest notion effective capacity dataset independent unlikely explain generalization performance deep network train gradient base method training data play important role determine degree memorization
