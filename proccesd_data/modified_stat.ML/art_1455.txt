 weight tensor decomposition learn latent variable partial data tensor decomposition method popular tool learn latent variable give lower-order moment data however standard assumption sufficient data estimate moment high accuracy work consider case certain dimension data always observe -- -common applied setting measurement may take observation -- -resulting moment estimate vary quality derive weighted tensor decomposition approach computationally efficient non-weighted approach demonstrate outperform method appropriately leverage less-observed dimension
