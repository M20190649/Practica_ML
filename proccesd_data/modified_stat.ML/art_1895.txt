 kernel-based conditional independence test application causal discovery conditional independence testing important problem especially bayesian network learning causal discovery due curse dimensionality test conditional independence continuous variable particularly challenging propose kernel-based conditional independence test kci-test construct appropriate test statistic derive asymptotic distribution null hypothesis conditional independence propose method computationally efficient easy implement experimental result show outperform method especially conditioning set large sample size large case method encounter difficulty
