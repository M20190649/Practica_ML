 online isotonic regression consider online version isotonic regression problem give set linearly order point e.g. real line learner must predict label sequentially adversarially choose position evaluate total squared loss compare best isotonic non-decreasing function hindsight survey several standard online learn algorithm show none achieve optimal regret exponent fact include online gradient descent follow leader exponential weight incur linear regret prove exponential weight algorithm play covering net isotonic function regret bound big log big present matching omega low bound regret provide computationally efficient version algorithm also analyze noise-free case revealed label isotonic show bound improve log even label reveal isotonic order finally extend analysis beyond squared loss give bound entropic loss absolute loss
