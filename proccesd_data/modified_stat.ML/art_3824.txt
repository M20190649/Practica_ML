 feature rank multi-label classification use markov network propose simple efficient method rank feature multi-label classification method produce ranking feature show relevance predict label turn allows choose final subset feature procedure base markov network allow model dependency label feature direct way first step build simple network use label test much add single feature affect initial network specifically first step use ising model whereas second step base score statistic allow test significance added feature quickly propose approach require transformation label space give interpretable result allow attractive visualization dependency structure give theoretical justification procedure discuss theoretical property ising model score statistic also discuss feature rank procedure base fit ising model use l regularize logistic regression numerical experiment show propose method outperform conventional approach consider artificial real datasets
