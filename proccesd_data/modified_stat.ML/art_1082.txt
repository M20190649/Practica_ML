 automatic generation probabilistic programming time series data probabilistic programming language represent complex data intermingled model line code efficient inference algorithm probabilistic programming language make possible build unified framework compute interesting probability various large real-world problem structure model give construct probabilistic program rather straightforward thus main focus learn best model parameter compute marginal probability paper provide new perspective build expressive probabilistic program continue time series data structure model give intuition behind method find descriptive covariance structure time series data nonparametric gaussian process regression report descriptive covariance structure efficiently derive probabilistic programming description accurately
