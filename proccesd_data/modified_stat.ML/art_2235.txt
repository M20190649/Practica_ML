 fuse multiple graphical lasso paper consider problem estimate multiple graphical model simultaneously use fused lasso penalty encourage adjacent graph share similar structure motivating example analysis brain network alzheimer 's disease use neuroimaging data specifically may wish estimate brain network normal control nc brain network patient mild cognitive impairment mci brain network alzheimer 's patient ad expect two brain network nc mci share common structure identical similarly two brain network mci ad propose formulation solve use second-order method key technical contribution establish necessary sufficient condition graph decomposable base key property simple screening rule present decompose large graph small subgraphs allow efficient estimation multiple independent small subgraphs dramatically reduce computational cost perform experiment synthetic real data result demonstrate effectiveness efficiency propose approach
