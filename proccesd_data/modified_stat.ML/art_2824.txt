 penalize estimation direct acyclic graph discrete data bayesian network structure give directed acyclic graph dag popular class graphical model however learn bayesian network discrete categorical data particularly challenging due large parameter space difficulty search sparse structure article develop maximum penalized likelihood method tackle problem instead commonly use multinomial distribution model conditional distribution node give parent multi-logit regression edge parameterized set coefficient vector dummy variable encode level node obtain sparse dag group norm penalty employ blockwise coordinate descent algorithm develop maximize penalized likelihood subject acyclicity constraint dag interventional data available method construct causal network direct edge represent causal relation apply method various simulate real data set result show method competitive compare many exist method dag estimation interventional high-dimensional observational data
