 directlingam direct method learn linear non-gaussian structural equation model structural equation model bayesian network widely use analyze causal relation continuous variable framework linear acyclic model typically use model data-generating process variable recently show use non-gaussianity identifies full structure linear acyclic model i.e. causal ordering variable connection strength without use prior knowledge network structure case conventional method however exist estimation method base iterative search algorithm may converge correct solution finite number step paper propose new direct method estimate causal ordering connection strength base non-gaussianity contrast previous method algorithm require algorithmic parameter guarantee converge right solution within small fixed number step data strictly follow model
