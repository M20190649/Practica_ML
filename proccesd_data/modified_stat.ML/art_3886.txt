 robustness bayesian pool-based active learning prior misspecification study robustness active learn al algorithm prior misspecification whether algorithm achieve similar performance use perturbed prior compare use true prior average bad case maximum coverage setting prove alpha -approximate algorithm robust i.e. near alpha -approximate utility lipschitz continuous prior show robustness may achieve utility non-lipschitz suggest use lipschitz utility al robustness require minimum cost setting also obtain robustness result approximate al algorithm result imply many commonly use al algorithm robust perturbed prior propose use mixture prior alleviate problem prior misspecification analyze robustness uniform mixture prior show experimentally perform reasonably well practice
