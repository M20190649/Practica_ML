 lass- sparse non-convex regression local search compute approximate solution l regularized linear regression use l regularization also know lasso initialization step algorithm lass- lass-zero use computationally efficient stepwise search determine locally optimal l solution give l regularization solution present theoretical result consistency orthogonality appropriate handling redundant feature empirically use synthetic data demonstrate lass- solution close true sparse support l regularization model additionally real-world data lass- find parsimonious solution l regularization maintain similar predictive accuracy
