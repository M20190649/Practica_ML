 identify outlier use influence function multiple kernel canonical correlation analysis image genetic research essentially focus discover unique co-association effect typically ignore identify outlier atypical object genetic well non-genetics variable identify significant outlier essential challenging issue image genetics multiple source data analysis therefore need examine transcription error identified outlier first address influence function kernel mean element kernel covariance operator kernel cross-covariance operator kernel canonical correlation analysis kernel cca multiple kernel cca second propose multiple kernel cca apply two datasets third propose visualization method detect influential observation multiple source data base kernel cca multiple kernel cca finally propose method capable analyze outlier subject usually find biomedical application number dimension large examine outlier use stem-and-leaf display experiment synthesize image genetics data e.g. snp fmri dna methylation demonstrate propose visualization apply effectively
