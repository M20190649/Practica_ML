 nonparametric bayesian mixed-effect model sparse gaussian process approach multi-task learning model use gaussian process gp develop successfully apply various application main difficulty approach computational cost inference use union example task therefore sparse solution avoid use entire data directly instead use set informative representative desirable paper investigate problem grouped mixed-effect gp model individual response give fixed-effect take one set unknown group plus random individual effect function capture variation among individual model widely use previous work sparse solution develop paper present first sparse solution problem show sparse approximation obtain maximize variational low bound marginal likelihood generalize idea single-task gaussian process handle mixed-effect model well grouping experiment use artificial real data validate approach show recover performance inference full sample outperform baseline method outperform state art sparse solution multi-task gp formulation
