 smooth sparse cod via marginal regression learn sparse representation propose analyze novel framework learn sparse representation base two statistical technique kernel smoothing marginal regression propose approach provide flexible framework incorporate feature similarity temporal information present data set via non-parametric kernel smooth provide generalization bound dictionary learning use smooth sparse coding show sample complexity depend l norm kernel function use furthermore propose use marginal regression obtain sparse code significantly improve speed allow one scale large dictionary size easily demonstrate advantage propose approach term accuracy speed extensive experimentation several real data set addition demonstrate propose approach could use improve semi-supervised sparse coding
