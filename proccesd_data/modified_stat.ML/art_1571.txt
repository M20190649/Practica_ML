 bucket renormalization approximate inference probabilistic graphical model key tool machine learning application compute partition function i.e. normalize constant fundamental task statistical inference generally computationally intractable lead extensive study approximation method iterative variational method popular successful family approach however even state art variational method return poor result fail converge difficult instance paper instead consider compute partition function via sequential summation variable develop robust approximate algorithm combine idea mini-bucket elimination tensor network renormalization group method statistical physic result convergence-free method show good empirical performance synthetic real-world benchmark model even difficult instance
