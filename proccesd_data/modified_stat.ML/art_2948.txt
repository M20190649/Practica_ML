 larsen-elm selective ensemble extreme learn machine use lars blend data extreme learning machine elm neural network algorithm show good performance fast speed simple structure etc also weak robustness unavoidable defect original elm blend data present new machine learning framework call larsen-elm overcome problem paper would like show two key step larsen-elm first step preprocessing select input variable highly relate output use least angle regression lars second step training employ genetic algorithm ga base selective ensemble original elm experiment apply sum two sine four datasets uci repository verify robustness approach experimental result show compare original elm method op-elm gasen-elm lsboost larsen-elm significantly improve robustness performance keep relatively high speed
