 scalable generalize linear bandit online computation hash generalize linear bandit glbs natural extension stochastic linear bandit popular successful recent year however exist glbs scale poorly number round number arm limit utility practice paper propose new scalable solution glb problem two respect first unlike exist glbs whose per-time-step space time complexity grow least linearly time propose new algorithm perform online computation enjoy constant space time complexity heart novel generalize linear extension online-to-confidence-set conversion gloc method take emph online learning algorithm turn glb algorithm special case apply gloc online newton step algorithm result low-regret glb algorithm much low time memory complexity prior work second case number n arm large propose new algorithm next arm select via inner product search method implement via hash algorithms i.e. hash-amenable result time complexity sublinear n thompson sample extension gloc hash-amenable regret bound -dimensional arm set scale whereas gloc 's regret bound scale towards close gap propose new hash-amenable algorithm whose regret bound scale finally propose fast approximate hash-key computation inner product good accuracy state-of-the-art independent interest conclude paper preliminary experimental result confirm merit method
