 deepsleepnet model automatic sleep stage score base raw single-channel eeg present study propose deep learning model name deepsleepnet automatic sleep stage score base raw single-channel eeg exist method rely hand-engineered feature require prior knowledge sleep analysis encode temporal information transition rule important identify next sleep stage extracted feature propose model utilize convolutional neural network extract time-invariant feature bidirectional-long short-term memory learn transition rule among sleep stage automatically eeg epoch implement two-step training algorithm train model efficiently evaluate model use different single-channel eeg f -eog leave fpz-cz pz-oz two public sleep datasets different property e.g. sample rate scoring standard aasm r k result show model achieve similar overall accuracy macro f -score mass sleep-edf compare state-of-the-art method mass sleep-edf datasets demonstrate without change model architecture training algorithm model could automatically learn feature sleep stage score different raw single-channel eeg different datasets without utilize hand-engineered feature
