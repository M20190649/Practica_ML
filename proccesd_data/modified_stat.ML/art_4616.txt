 short note extension theorem connection universal consistency machine learn statistical machine learning play important role modern statistic computer science one main goal statistical machine learning provide universally consistent algorithm i.e. estimator converges probability strong sense bayes risk bayes decision function kernel method base minimize regularize risk reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs belong statistical machine learn method general unknown kernel yield optimal result particular data set unknown probability measure hence various kernel learn method propose choose kernel therefore also rkhs data adaptive manner nevertheless many practitioner often use classical gaussian rbf kernel certain sobolev kernel good success goal short note offer one possible theoretical explanation empirical fact
