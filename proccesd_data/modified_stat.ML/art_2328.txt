 on-line relational som dissimilarity data application order address real world situation well data may complex simple vector example know pairwise dissimilarities several variant self organize map algorithm introduce generalize original algorithm framework whereas median som base rough representation prototype relational som allow represent prototype virtual combination element data set however latter approach suffers two main drawback first complexity large second batch version algorithm study far often provide result bad topographic organization article on-line version relational som describe justify algorithm test several datasets include categorical data graph compare batch version som algorithm non vector data
