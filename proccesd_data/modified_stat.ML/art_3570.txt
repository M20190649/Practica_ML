 empirical analysis sample base estimator evaluate rbms restricted boltzmann machine rbm use either classifier generative model quality generative rbm measure average log-likelihood test data due high computational complexity evaluate partition function exact calculation test log-likelihood difficult recent year estimation method suggest approximate computation test log-likelihood paper present empirical comparison main estimation method namely ai algorithm estimate partition function csl method directly estimate log-likelihood raise algorithm combine two idea use mnist data set learn rbm compare method estimate test log-likelihood
