 prediction error reduction function variable importance score paper introduces develop novel variable importance score function context ensemble learning demonstrate appeal theoretically empirically propose score function simple straightforward counterpart propose context random forest avoid permutation design computationally efficient random forest variable importance function like random forest variable importance function score handle regression classification seamlessly one distinct advantage propose score fact offer natural cut zero positive score indicate importance significance negative score deem indication insignificance extra advantage propose score lie fact work well beyond ensemble tree seamlessly use base learner random subspace learn context example simulate real demonstrate propose score compete mostly favorably random forest score
