 bayesian optimization unknown constraint recent work bayesian optimization show effectiveness global optimization difficult black-box objective function many real-world optimization problem interest also constraint unknown priori paper study bayesian optimization constrain problem general case noise may present constraint function objective constraint may evaluate independently provide motivate practical example present general framework solve problem demonstrate effectiveness approach optimize performance online latent dirichlet allocation subject topic sparsity constraint tune neural network give test-time memory constraint optimize hamiltonian monte carlo achieve maximal effectiveness fixed time subject pass standard convergence diagnostics
