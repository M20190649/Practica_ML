 reparameterization trick discrete variable low-variance gradient estimation crucial learn directed graphical model parameterized neural network reparameterization trick widely use continuous variable technique give low-variance gradient estimate directly applicable discrete variable sampling inherently require discontinuous operation argue discontinuity bypass marginalize variable interest result new reparameterization trick discrete variable reparameterization greatly reduce variance understood regard method application common random number estimation result estimator theoretically guarantee variance large likelihood-ratio method optimal input-dependent baseline give empirical result variational learning sigmoid belief network
