 higher-order factorization machine factorization machine fm supervised learning approach use second-order feature combination even data high-dimensional unfortunately despite increase interest fm exist date efficient training algorithm higher-order fm hofms paper present first generic yet efficient algorithm train arbitrary-order hofms also present new variant hofms shared parameter greatly reduce model size prediction time maintain similar accuracy demonstrate propose approach four different link prediction task
