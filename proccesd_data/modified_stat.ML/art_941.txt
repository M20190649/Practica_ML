 causal near neighbor rule optimal treatment regimes estimation optimal treatment regime considerable interest precision medicine work propose causal k -nearest neighbor method estimate optimal treatment regime method root framework causal inference estimate causal treatment effect within near neighborhood although method simple possess nice theoretical property show causal k -nearest neighbor regime universally consistent causal k -nearest neighbor regime eventually learn optimal treatment regime sample size increase also establish convergence rate however causal k -nearest neighbor regime may suffer curse dimensionality i.e performance deteriorates dimensionality increase alleviate problem develop adaptive causal k -nearest neighbor method perform metric selection variable selection simultaneously performance propose method illustrate simulation study analysis chronic depression clinical trial
