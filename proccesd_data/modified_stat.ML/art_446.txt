 bayesian estimation approach analyze non-gaussian data-generating process latent class large amount observational data accumulate various field recent time grow need estimate generate process data linear non-gaussian acyclic model lingam base non-gaussianity external influence propose estimate data-generating process variable however result estimation bias latent class paper first review lingam extended model well estimation procedure lingam bayesian framework propose new bayesian estimation procedure solve problem
