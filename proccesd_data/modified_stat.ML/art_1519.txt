 multi-set canonical correlation analysis simply explain multitude method perform multi-set correlated component analysis mcca include require iterative solution method differ criterion optimize constraint place solution note focus perhaps simple version solve single step eigenvectors matrix bf bf r bf r covariance matrix concatenate data bf block-diagonal note show solution maximize inter-set correlation isc without constraint also relate solution two step procedure first whiten dataset use pca perform additional pca concatenate whiten data solution know although clear derivation simple implementation hard find short note aim remedy
