 estimate nonlinear dynamic convnet smoother estimate state dynamical system series noise-corrupted observation fundamental many area science engineering well-known method kalman smoother related kalman filter relies assumption linearity gaussianity rarely meet practice paper introduce new dynamical smoothing method exploit remarkable capability convolutional neural network approximate complex non-linear function main idea generate training set compose latent state observation ensemble simulator train deep network recover former latter importantly method require availability simulator therefore apply situation either latent dynamical model observation model easily express closed form simulation study show result convnet smoother almost optimal performance gaussian case even parameter unknown furthermore method successfully apply extremely non-linear non-gaussian system finally empirically validate approach via analysis measure brain signal
