 efficient regularize least-squares algorithm conditional ranking relational data domain like bioinformatics information retrieval social network analysis one find learning task goal consist infer ranking object condition particular target object present general kernel framework learn conditional ranking various type relational data ranking condition unseen data object propose efficient algorithm conditional ranking optimize square regression ranking loss function show theoretically learn ranking loss likely generalize good regression loss prove symmetry reciprocity property relation efficiently enforce learned model experiment synthetic real-world data illustrate propose method deliver state-of-the-art performance term predictive power computational efficiency moreover also show empirically incorporate symmetry reciprocity property improve generalization performance
