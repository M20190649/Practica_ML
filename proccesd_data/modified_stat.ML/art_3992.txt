 conditional image synthesis auxiliary classifier gans synthesize high resolution photorealistic image long-standing challenge machine learning paper introduce new method improved training generative adversarial network gans image synthesis construct variant gans employ label conditioning result x resolution image sample exhibit global coherence expand previous work image quality assessment provide two new analysis assess discriminability diversity sample class-conditional image synthesis model analysis demonstrate high resolution sample provide class information present low resolution sample across imagenet class x sample twice discriminable artificially resize x sample addition class sample exhibit diversity comparable real imagenet data
