 stochastic alternate direction method multiplier variance reduction nonconvex optimization paper study stochastic alternating direction method multiplier admm nonconvex optimization propose three class nonconvex stochastic admm variance reduction base different reduce variance stochastic gradient specifically first class call nonconvex stochastic variance reduce gradient admm svrg-admm use multi-stage scheme progressively reduce variance stochastic gradient second nonconvex stochastic average gradient admm sag-admm additionally use old gradient estimate previous iteration third call saga-admm extension sag-admm method moreover mild condition establish iteration complexity bound epsilon propose method obtain epsilon -stationary solution nonconvex optimization particular provide general framework analyze iteration complexity nonconvex stochastic admm method variance reduction finally numerical experiment demonstrate effectiveness method
