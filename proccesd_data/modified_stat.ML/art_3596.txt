 parallel algorithm mathcal x -armed bandits target mathcal x -armed bandit problem find global maximum unknown stochastic function f give finite budget n evaluation recently mathcal x -armed bandit widely use many situation many application need deal large-scale data set deal large-scale data set study distributed setting mathcal x -armed bandit player collaborate find maximum unknown function develop novel anytime distribute mathcal x -armed bandit algorithm compare prior work mathcal x -armed bandit algorithm use quite different search strategy fit distributed learn scenario theoretical analysis show distributed algorithm time faster classical single-player algorithm moreover number communication round algorithm logarithmic mn numerical result show method make effective use every player minimize loss thus distributed approach attractive useful
