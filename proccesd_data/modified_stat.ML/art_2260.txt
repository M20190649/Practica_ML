 cost-sensitive tree classifier recently machine learn algorithm successfully enter large-scale real-world industrial application e.g search engine email spam filter cpu cost test time must budget account paper address challenge balance test-time cost classifier accuracy principled fashion test-time cost classifier often dominate computation require feature extraction-which vary drastically across eatures decrease extraction time construct tree classifier test input traverse along individual path path extract different feature optimize specific sub-partition input space compute feature input benefit cost sensitive tree classifier match high accuracy current state-of-the-art small fraction computational cost
