 mixture representation inference learning boltzmann machine boltzmann machine undirected graphical model two-state stochastic variable logarithm clique potential quadratic function node state widely study neural computing literature although practical applicability limit difficulty find effective learning algorithm one well-established approach know mean field theory represent stochastic distribution use factorized approximation however correspond learning algorithm often fail find good solution conjecture due implicit uni-modality mean field approximation therefore unable capture multi-modality true distribution paper use variational method approximate stochastic distribution use multi-modal mixture factorized distribution present result inference learning demonstrate effectiveness approach
