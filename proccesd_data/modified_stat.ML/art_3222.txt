 weighted sgd ell p regression randomized preconditioning recent year stochastic gradient descent sgd method randomize linear algebra rla algorithm apply many large-scale problem machine learning data analysis aim bridge gap two method solve constrain overdetermined linear regression problem -- -e.g. ell ell regression problem propose hybrid algorithm name pwsgd use rla technique precondition construct importance sample distribution perform sgd-like iterative process weighted sample preconditioned system prove pwsgd inherits faster convergence rate depend low dimension linear system maintain low computation complexity particularly solve ell regression size n pwsgd return approximate solution epsilon relative error objective value mathcal log n cdot text nnz text poly epsilon time complexity uniformly good rla method term epsilon problem unconstrained ell regression pwsgd return approximate solution epsilon relative error objective value solution vector measure prediction norm mathcal log n cdot text nnz text poly log epsilon epsilon time also provide low bound coreset complexity general regression problem indicate still new idea need extend similar rla precondition idea weighted sgd algorithm general regression problem finally effectiveness algorithm illustrate numerically synthetic real datasets
