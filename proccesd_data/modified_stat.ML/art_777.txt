 overdispersed black-box variational inference introduce overdispersed black-box variational inference method reduce variance monte carlo estimator gradient black-box variational inference instead take sample variational distribution use importance sampling take sample overdispersed distribution exponential family variational approximation approach general since readily apply exponential family distribution typical choice variational approximation run experiment two non-conjugate probabilistic model show method effectively reduce variance overhead introduce computation proposal parameter importance weight negligible find overdispersed importance sample scheme provide low variance black-box variational inference even latter us twice number sample result fast convergence black-box inference procedure
