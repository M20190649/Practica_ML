 scalable variational inference dynamical system gradient matching promising tool learn parameter state dynamic ordinary differential equation grid free inference approach fully observable system time competitive numerical integration however many real-world application sparse observation available even unobserved variable include model description case gradient matching method difficult apply simply provide satisfactory result despite high computational cost numerical integration still gold standard many application use exist gradient match approach propose scalable variational inference framework infer state parameter simultaneously offer computational speedup improve accuracy work well even model misspecifications partially observable system
