 bayesian classification regression high dimensional feature thesis respond challenge use large number thousand feature regression classification problem two situation high dimensional feature arise one high dimensional measurement available example gene expression data produce microarray technique computational reason people may select small subset feature model data look relevant feature predict response base measure correlation response training data although use commonly procedure make response appear predictable actually chapter propose bayesian method avoid selection bias application naive bayes model mixture model high dimensional feature also arise consider high-order interaction number parameter increase exponentially order consider chapter propose method compress group parameter single one exploit fact many predictor variable derive high-order interaction value training case number compressed parameter may converge consider high possible order apply compression method logistic sequence prediction model logistic classification model use simulate data real data test method chapter
