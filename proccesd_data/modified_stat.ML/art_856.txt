 error metric learn reliable manifold stream data spectral dimensionality reduction frequently use identify low-dimensional structure high-dimensional data however learn manifold especially stream data computationally memory expensive paper argue stable manifold learn use fraction stream remain stream map manifold significantly less costly manner identify transition point manifold stable key step present error metric allow u identify transition point give stream quantitatively assess quality manifold learn use isomap propose efficient mapping algorithm call s-isomap use map new sample onto stable manifold describe experiment variety data set show propose approach computationally efficient without sacrifice accuracy
