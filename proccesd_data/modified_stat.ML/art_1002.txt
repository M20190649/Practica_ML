 manifold unwrap use density ridge research manifold learning within density ridge estimation framework show great potential recent work estimation de-noising manifold build intuitive well-defined notion principal curve surface however problem unwrap unfold manifold receive relatively little attention within density ridge approach despite integral part manifold learning general paper propose two novel algorithm unwrap manifold base estimate principal curve surface one- multi-dimensional manifold respectively method unwrap found realization principal curve principal surface inherent local maximum probability density function follow observation coordinate system follow shape manifold compute follow integral curve gradient flow kernel density estimate manifold furthermore since integral curve gradient flow kernel density estimate inherently local propose stitch together local coordinate system use parallel transport along manifold provide numerical experiment real synthetic data illustrate clear intuitive unwrapping result comparable state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithm
