 subspace learn extremely compressed measurement consider learn principal subspace large set vector extremely small number compressive measurement vector theoretical result show even constant number measurement per column suffices approximate principal subspace arbitrary precision provide number vector large result achieve simple algorithm compute eigenvectors estimate covariance matrix main insight exploit average effect arise apply different random projection vector provide number simulation confirm theoretical result
