 disease prediction base functional connectomes use scalable spatially-informed support vector machine substantial evidence indicate major psychiatric disorder associate distributed neural dysconnectivity lead strong interest use neuroimaging method accurately predict disorder status work specifically interested multivariate approach use feature derive whole-brain rest state functional connectomes however functional connectomes reside high dimensional space complicate model interpretation introduces numerous statistical computational challenge traditional feature selection technique use reduce data dimensionality blind spatial structure connectomes propose regularization framework -d structure functional connectome explicitly take account via fused lasso graphnet regularizer method restrict loss function convex margin-based allow non-differentiable loss function hinge-loss use use fused lasso graphnet regularizer hinge-loss lead structured sparse support vector machine svm embedded feature selection introduce novel efficient optimization algorithm base augmented lagrangian classical alternating direction method solve fused lasso graphnet regularize svm little modification also demonstrate inner subproblems algorithm solve efficiently analytic form couple variable splitting strategy data augmentation scheme experiment simulate data rest state scan large schizophrenia dataset show propose approach identify predictive region spatially contiguous -d connectome space offer additional layer interpretability could provide new insight various disease process
