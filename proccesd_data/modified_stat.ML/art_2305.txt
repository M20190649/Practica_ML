 locally weight naive bayes despite simplicity naive bayes classifier surprise machine learn researcher exhibit good performance variety learn problem encourage result researcher look overcome naive bayes primary weakness attribute independence improve performance algorithm paper present locally weighted version naive bayes relax independence assumption learn local model prediction time experimental result show locally weight naive bayes rarely degrade accuracy compare standard naive bayes many case improve accuracy dramatically main advantage method compare technique enhance naive bayes conceptual computational simplicity
