 adaptive strategy active learning smooth decision boundary present first adaptive strategy active learning setting classification smooth decision boundary problem adaptivity unknown distributional parameter remain open since seminal work castro nowak first establish active learning rate setting recent advance problem establish adaptive rate case univariate data adaptivity practical setting multivariate data far remained elusive combine insight various recent work show multivariate case careful reduction univariate-adaptive strategy yield near-optimal rate without prior knowledge distributional parameter
