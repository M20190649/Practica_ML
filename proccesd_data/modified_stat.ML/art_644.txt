 scalable gaussian process classification via expectation propagation variational method recently consider scale training process gaussian process classifier large datasets alternative describe train classifier efficiently use expectation propagation propose method allow handle datasets million data instance precisely use training distributed fashion data instance send different node required computation carry ii maximize estimate marginal likelihood use stochastic approximation gradient several experiment indicate method describe competitive variational approach
