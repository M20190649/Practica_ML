 identification gaussian process state space model gaussian process state space model gpssm non-linear dynamical system unknown transition measurement mapping describe gps research gpssms focus state estimation problem i.e. compute posterior latent state give model however key challenge gpssms satisfactorily address yet system identification i.e. learn model address challenge impose structured gaussian variational posterior distribution latent state parameterised recognition model form bi-directional recurrent neural network inference structure allow u recover posterior smooth sequence data provide practical algorithm efficiently compute low bound marginal likelihood use reparameterisation trick allow use arbitrary kernel within gpssm demonstrate learnt gpssm efficiently generate plausible future trajectory identified system observe small number episode true system
