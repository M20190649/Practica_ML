 nest mini-batch k-means new algorithm propose accelerate mini-batch k-means algorithm sculley use distance bound approach elkan argue incorporate distance bound mini-batch algorithm already use data preferentially reuse end propose use nest mini-batches whereby data mini-batch iteration automatically reuse iteration use nest mini-batches present two difficulty first unbalanced use data bias estimate resolve ensure data sample contribute exactly centroid second choose mini-batch size address balance premature fine-tuning centroid redundancy induce slow-down experiment show result nmbatch algorithm effective often arrive within empirical minimum time earlier standard mini-batch algorithm
