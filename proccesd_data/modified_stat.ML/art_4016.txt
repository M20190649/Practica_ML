 linear convergence svrg statistical estimation svrg variant among state art optimization algorithm large scale machine learning problem well know svrg converges linearly objective function strongly convex however setup restrictive include several important formulation lasso group lasso logistic regression non-convex model include correct lasso scad paper prove class statistical m-estimators cover example mention svrg solve formulation em linear convergence rate without strong convexity even convexity analysis make use em restrict strong convexity show svrg converges linearly fundamental statistical precision model i.e. difference true unknown parameter theta optimal solution hat theta model
