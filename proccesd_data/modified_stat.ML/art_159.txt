 algebraic geometric comparison probability distribution propose novel algebraic framework treat probability distribution represent cumulants mean covariance matrix example consider unsupervised learning problem find subspace several probability distribution agree instead minimize objective function involve estimated cumulants show treat cumulants element polynomial ring directly solve problem low computational cost high accuracy moreover algebraic viewpoint probability distribution allow u invoke theory algebraic geometry demonstrate compact proof identifiability criterion
