 complexity piecewise affine system identification paper provide result regard computational complexity hybrid system identification precisely focus estimation piecewise affine pwa map input-output data analyze complexity compute global minimizer error previous work show global solution could obtain continuous pwa map worst-case complexity exponential number data paper show global optimality reach slightly general class possibly discontinuous pwa map complexity polynomial number data however exponential complexity respect data dimension result obtain via analysis intrinsic classification subproblem associate data point different mode addition prove problem np-hard thus exponential complexity dimension natural expectation exact algorithm
