 flexibly mine well subgroup subgroup discovery also know supervised pattern mining discover high quality one-dimensional subgroup refinement crucial task nominal attribute relatively straightforward consider individual attribute value binary feature numerical attribute task challenging individual numeric value reliable statistic instead consider combination adjacent value i.e bin exist binning strategy however tailor subgroup discovery directly optimize quality subgroup therewith potentially degrade mining result address issue propose flexi short flexi propose use optimal binning find high quality binary feature numeric ordinal attribute instantiate flexi various quality measure show achieve efficiency accordingly experiment synthetic real-world data set show flexi outperforms state art time improvement subgroup quality
