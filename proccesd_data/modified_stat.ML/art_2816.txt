 support vector machine model currency crisis discrimination support vector machine svm powerful classification technique base idea structural risk minimization use kernel function enable curse dimensionality address however proper kernel function certain problem dependent specific dataset good method choice kernel function paper svm use build empirical model currency crisis argentina estimation technique develop train model real life data set provide reasonably accurate model output help policy maker identify situation currency crisis may happen third fourth order polynomial kernel generally best choice achieve high generalization classifier performance svm high level maturity algorithm simple easy implement tolerate curse dimensionality good empirical performance satisfactory result show currency crisis situation properly emulate use small fraction database could use evaluation tool well early warning system best knowledge first work svm approach currency crisis evaluation argentina
