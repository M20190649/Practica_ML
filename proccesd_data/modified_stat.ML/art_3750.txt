 study tune parameter selection high-dimensional lasso high-dimensional predictive model measurement observation require regularization well define perform well empirically possess theoretical guarantee amount regularization often determine tune parameter integral achieve good performance one choose tuning parameter variety way resampling method generalize information criterion however theory support many regularized procedure relies estimate variance parameter complicate high dimension develop suite information criterion choose tune parameter lasso regression leverage literature high-dimensional variance estimation derive intuition show exist information-theoretic approach work poorly setting compare risk estimator exist method extensive simulation derive theoretical justification find new estimator perform well across wide range simulation condition evaluation criterion
