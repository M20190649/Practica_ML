 compressive k-means lloyd-max algorithm classical approach perform k-means cluster unfortunately cost becomes prohibitive training dataset grow large propose compressive version k-means ckm estimate cluster center sketch i.e drastically compress representation training dataset demonstrate empirically ckm performs similarly lloyd-max sketch size proportional number cen-troids time ambient dimension independent size original dataset give sketch computational complexity ckm also independent size dataset unlike lloyd-max require several replicates demonstrate ckm almost insensitive initialization large dataset data point show ckm run two order magnitude faster five replicates lloyd-max similar cluster performance artificial data finally ckm achieves low classification error handwritten digit classification
