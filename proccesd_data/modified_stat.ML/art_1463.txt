 distance correlation multiscale graph correlation understanding develop correlation measure detect general dependency imperative statistic machine learning also crucial general scientific discovery big data age paper establish new framework generalize distance correlation -- correlation measure recently propose show universally consistent dependence test joint distribution finite moment -- multiscale graph correlation mgc utilize characteristic function incorporate near neighbor machinery formalize population version local distance correlation define optimal scale give dependency name optimal local correlation mgc new theoretical framework motivate theoretically sound sample mgc allow number desirable property prove include universal consistency convergence almost unbiasedness sample version advantage mgc illustrate via comprehensive set simulation linear nonlinear univariate multivariate noisy dependency lose almost power monotone dependency achieve good performance general dependency compare distance correlation popular method
