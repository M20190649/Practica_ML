 provable algorithm inference topic model recently considerable progress design algorithm provable guarantee -- typically use linear algebraic method -- parameter learning latent variable model design provable algorithm inference prove challenging take first step towards provable inference topic model leverage property topic model enable u construct simple linear estimator unknown topic proportion small variance consequently work short document estimator also correspond find estimate around posterior well-concentrated show low bound short document information theoretically impossible find hidden topic finally give empirical result demonstrate algorithm work realistic topic model yield good solution synthetic data run time comparable em single iteration gibbs sampling
