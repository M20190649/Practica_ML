 structure learning partial annotation structure learning appropriate predict structure output tree graph sequence prior work require training set consist complete tree graph sequence specify detail ground truth tedious infeasible large output main contribution large margin formulation make structure learn partially annotate data possible result optimization problem non-convex yet efficiently solve concave-convex procedure cccp novel speedup strategy apply method challenge tracking-by-assignment problem variable number divisible object benchmark use full annotation achieve performance comparable model learn full annotation finally offer unifying perspective previous work use hinge ramp max loss structured learning follow empirical comparison practical performance
