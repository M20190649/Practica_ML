 deep tractable density estimator neural autoregressive distribution estimator nade real-valued version rnade competitive density model multidimensional data across variety domain model use fixed arbitrary ordering data dimension one easily condition variable beginning ordering marginalize variable end ordering however inference task require approximate inference work introduce efficient procedure simultaneously train nade model possible ordering variable share parameter across model thus use convenient model inference task hand ensemble model different ordering immediately available moreover unlike original nade training procedure scale deep model empirically ensemble deep nade model obtain state art density estimation performance
