 graph estimation multi-attribute data many real world network problem often concern multivariate nodal attribute image textual multi-view feature vector node rather simple univariate nodal attribute exist graph estimation method build gaussian graphical model covariance selection algorithm handle data neither theory develop around method directly apply paper propose new principled framework estimate graph multi-attribute data instead estimate partial correlation current literature method estimate partial canonical correlation naturally accommodate complex nodal feature computationally provide efficient algorithm utilize multi-attribute structure theoretically provide sufficient condition guarantee consistent graph recovery extensive simulation study demonstrate performance method various condition furthermore provide illustrative application uncovering gene regulatory network gene protein profile uncover brain connectivity graph functional magnetic resonance imaging data
