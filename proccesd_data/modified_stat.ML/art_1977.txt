 compute posterior probability structural feature bayesian network study problem learn bayesian network structure data koivisto sood koivisto present algorithm compute exact marginal posterior probability subnetwork e.g. single edge n n time posterior probability n n- potential edge n n total time assume number parent per node indegree bound constant one main drawback algorithm requirement special structure prior non uniform respect markov equivalence paper develop algorithm compute exact posterior probability subnetwork n time posterior probability n n- potential edge n n total time algorithm also assume bounded indegree allow general structure prior demonstrate applicability algorithm several data set variable
