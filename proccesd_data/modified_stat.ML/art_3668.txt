 canonical autocorrelation analysis present extension sparse canonical correlation analysis cca design find multiple-to-multiple linear correlation within single set variable unlike cca find correlation two set data row match exactly columns represent separate set variable method propose canonical autocorrelation analysis caa find multivariate correlation within one set variable useful look hidden parsimonious structure data involve small subset feature addition discovered correlation highly interpretable form pair sparse linear combination original feature show caa use tool anomaly detection expected structure correlation follow anomalous data illustrate utility caa two application domain single-class unsupervised learning correlation structure particularly relevant breast cancer diagnosis radiation threat detection apply wisconsin breast cancer data single-class caa competitive supervised method use literature radiation threat detection task unsupervised caa performs significantly good unsupervised alternative prevalent domain provide valuable additional insight threat analysis
