 energy-based generative adversarial network introduce energy-based generative adversarial network model ebgan view discriminator energy function attribute low energy region near data manifold high energy region similar probabilistic gans generator see train produce contrastive sample minimal energy discriminator train assign high energy generate sample view discriminator energy function allow use wide variety architecture loss functionals addition usual binary classifier logistic output among show one instantiation ebgan framework use auto-encoder architecture energy reconstruction error place discriminator show form ebgan exhibit stable behavior regular gans training also show single-scale architecture train generate high-resolution image
