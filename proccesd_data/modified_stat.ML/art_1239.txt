 reduce crowdsourcing graphon estimation statistically infer correct answer binary task base multiple noisy answer unsupervised manner emerge canonical question micro-task crowdsourcing generally aggregating opinion graphon estimation one interested estimate edge intensity probability node use single snapshot graph realization recent literature excite development within topic context crowdsourcing key intellectual challenge understand whether give task accurately denoised aggregate answer collect different task context graphon estimation precise information limit estimation algorithms remain interest paper utilize statistical reduction crowdsourcing graphon estimation advance state-of-art challenge use concept graphon estimation design algorithm achieve good performance em majority voting scheme setup go beyond em rank one model consider literature use know explicit low bound crowdsourcing provide refine low bound graphon estimation
