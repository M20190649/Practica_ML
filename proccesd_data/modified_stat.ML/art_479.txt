 novel statistical method base dynamic model classification realization stochastic process often observed temporal data functional data grow interest classification dynamic functional data basic feature functional data functional data infinite dimension highly correlate essential issue classify dynamic functional data effectively reduce dimension explore dynamic feature however statistical method dynamic data classification directly use rich dynamic feature data propose use second order ordinary differential equation ode model dynamic process principal differential analysis estimate constant time-varying parameter ode examine differential dynamic property dynamic system across different condition include stability transient-response determine dynamic system maintain function performance broad range random internal external perturbation use parameter ode feature classifier proof principle propose method apply classify normal abnormal qrs complex electrocardiogram ecg data analysis great clinical value diagnosis cardiovascular disease show ode-based classification method qrs complex classification outperform currently widely use neural network fourier expansion coefficient functional data feature expect dynamic model-based classification method may open new avenue functional data classification
