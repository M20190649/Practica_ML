 policy error bound model-based reinforcement learn factored linear model paper study model-based approach calculate approximately optimal policy markovian decision process particular derive novel bound loss use policy derive factored linear model class model generalize numerous previous model come strong computational guarantee first time literature derive performance bound model-based technique model inaccuracy measure weighted norm moreover bound show decreased sensitivity discount factor unlike similar bound derive approach insensitive measure mismatch similarly previous work proof also base contraction argument main difference use carefully construct norm build banach lattice contraction property assume operator act compressed space thus weaken previous assumption strengthen previous result
