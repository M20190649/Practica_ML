 online learn gaussian payoff side observation consider sequential learning problem gaussian payoff side information select action learner receive information payoff every action j form gaussian observation whose mean mean payoff variance depend pair j may infinite setup allow refined information transfer one action another previous partial monitoring setup include recently introduce graph-structured feedback case first time literature provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent low bound regret algorithm recover exist asymptotic problem-dependent low bound finite-time minimax low bound available literature also provide algorithm achieve problem-dependent low bound universal constant factor minimax low bound logarithmic factor
