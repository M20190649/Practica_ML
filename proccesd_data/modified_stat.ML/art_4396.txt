 recover miss sensor data iterative imputing network sensor data play important role machine learning task complementary human-annotated data usually rather costly however due systematic accidental mis-operations sensor data come often variety miss value result considerable difficulty follow-up analysis visualization previous work impute miss value interpolate observational feature space without consult latent hidden dynamic contrast model capture latent complex temporal dynamic summarize observation 's context novel iterative imputing network thus significantly outperform previous work benchmark beijing air quality meteorological dataset model also yield consistent superiority method case different miss rate
