 convex relaxation bregman divergence cluster although many convex relaxation cluster propose past decade current formulation remain restricted spherical gaussian discriminative model susceptible imbalanced cluster address shortcoming propose new class convex relaxation flexibly apply general form bregman divergence clustering base new formulation normalized equivalence relation retain additional control relaxation quality allow improvement cluster quality furthermore develop optimization method improve scalability exploit recent implicit matrix norm method practice find new formulation able efficiently produce tight clustering improve accuracy state art method
