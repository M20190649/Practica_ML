 tight variational representation f-divergences via restriction probability measure show variational representation f-divergences currently use literature tighten implication number method recently propose base representation example application use tighter representation derive general f-divergence estimator base two i.i.d sample derive dual program estimator perform well empirically also point connection estimator mmd
