 variational bayesian inference hidden markov model multivariate gaussian output distribution hide markov model hmm use several year many time series analysis pattern recognition task hmm often train mean baum-welch algorithm see special variant expectation maximization em algorithm second-order train technique variational bayesian inference vi probabilistic model regard parameter probabilistic model random variable define distribution distribution parameter hence name technique vi also bee regard special case em algorithm article bring together train hmm multivariate gaussian output distribution vi article define new training technique hmm evaluation base case study comparison related approach part ongoing work
