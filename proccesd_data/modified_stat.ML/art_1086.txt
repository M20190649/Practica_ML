 classification framework partially observed dynamical system present general framework classify partially observed dynamical system base idea learn model space contrast exist approach use model point estimate represent individual data item employ posterior distribution model thus take account principled manner uncertainty due generative observational dynamic noise observation sample time process evaluate framework two testbeds biological pathway model stochastic double-well system crucially show classifier performance impaired model class use infer posterior distribution much simple observation-generating model class provide reduced complexity inferential model class capture essential characteristic need give classification task
