 distinguishability criterion estimate generative model two recently introduce criterion estimation generative model base reduction binary classification noise-contrastive estimation nce estimation procedure generative model train able distinguish data sample noise sample generative adversarial network gans pair generator discriminator network generator network learn generate sample attempt fool discriminator network believe sample real data estimation procedure use function drive learning naturally raise question relate well whether function relate maximum likelihood estimation mle nce corresponds train internal data model belonging em discriminator network use fixed generator network show variant nce dynamic generator network equivalent maximum likelihood estimation since pair learned discriminator appropriate dynamically select generator recovers mle one might expect reverse hold pair learned generator certain discriminator however show recover mle learned generator require depart distinguishability game specifically expected gradient nce discriminator make match expected gradient mle one allow use non-stationary noise distribution nce ii choice discriminator network make expected gradient gan generator match mle iii exist theory guarantee gans converge non-convex case suggest key next step gan research determine whether gans converge modify training algorithm force convergence
