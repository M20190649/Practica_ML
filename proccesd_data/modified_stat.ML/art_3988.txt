 correlated-pca principal component analysis data noise correlate give matrix observed data principal component analysis pca compute small number orthogonal direction contain variability provably accurate solution pca use long time however best knowledge exist theoretical guarantee assume data corrupting noise mutually independent least uncorrelated valid practice often always paper study pca problem setting data noise correlate noise often also refer data-dependent noise obtain correctness result standard eigenvalue decomposition evd base solution pca simple assumption data-noise correlation also develop analyze generalization evd cluster-evd improve upon evd certain regime
