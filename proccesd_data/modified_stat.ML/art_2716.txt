 probable convexity application correlate topic model non-convex optimization problem often arise probabilistic modeling estimation posterior distribution non-convexity make problem intractable pose various obstacle u design efficient algorithm work attack non-convexity first introduce concept emph probable convexity analyze convexity real function practice use new concept analyze inference problem emph correlate topic model ctm related nonconjugate model contrary exist belief intractability show inference problem concave certain condition one consequence analysis novel algorithm learn ctm significantly scalable qualitative exist method finally highlight stochastic gradient algorithm might practical choice resolve efficiently non-convex problem finding might find beneficial many context beyond probabilistic modeling
