 lasso screening rule via dual polytope projection lasso widely use regression technique find sparse representation dimension feature space number sample extremely large solve lasso problem remain challenge improve efficiency solve large-scale lasso problem el ghaoui colleague propose safe rule able quickly identify inactive predictor i.e. predictor component solution vector inactive predictor feature remove optimization problem reduce scale transform standard lasso dual form show inactive predictor include set inactive constraint optimal dual solution paper propose efficient effective screening rule via dual polytope projection dpp mainly base uniqueness nonexpansiveness optimal dual solution due fact feasible set dual space convex close polytope moreover show screen rule extend identify inactive group group lasso best knowledge currently exact screening rule group lasso evaluate screening rule use synthetic real data set result show rule effective identify inactive predictor exist state-of-the-art screening rule lasso
