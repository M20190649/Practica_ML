 generalized cross validation filter generalize cross validation gcv one important approach use estimate parameter context inverse problem regularization technique notable example determination smoothness parameter spline data generate state space model like spline case efficient algorithm available evaluate gcv score complexity scale linearly data set size however method amenable on-line application since rely forward backward recursion hence objective evaluate time t- new data arrive time operation need update gcv score paper instead show update cost thus pave way on-line use gcv result obtain derive novel gcv filter extend classical kalman filter equation efficiently propagate gcv score time also illustrate application new filter context state estimation on-line regularize linear system identification
