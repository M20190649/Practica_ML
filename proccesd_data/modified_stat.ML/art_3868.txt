 deep convolutional net really need deep convolutional yes paper provide first empirical demonstration deep convolutional model really need deep convolutional even train method distillation allow small shallow model high accuracy train although previous research show shallow feed-forward net sometimes learn complex function previously learn deep net use number parameter deep model mimic paper demonstrate method use train accurate model cifar- unless student model contain multiple layer convolution although student model deep teacher model mimic student need multiple convolutional layer learn function comparable accuracy deep convolutional teacher
