 sample complexity multi-task reinforcement learn transfer knowledge across sequence reinforcement-learning task challenge number important application though encourage empirical evidence transfer improve performance subsequent reinforcement-learning task little theoretical analysis paper introduce new multi-task algorithm sequence reinforcement-learning task task sample independently unknown distribution finite set markov decision process whose parameter initially unknown setting prove certain assumption per-task sample complexity exploration reduce significantly due transfer compare standard single-task algorithm multi-task algorithm also desire characteristic guarantee exhibit negative transfer bad case per-task sample complexity comparable corresponding single-task algorithm
