 pattern learn side information supervise semi-supervised unsupervised learn estimate function give input output sample generalization learned function unseen data improve incorporate side information learning side information data neither input space output space function include useful information learn paper show learn side information subsume variety related approach e.g multi-task learning multi-view learning learn use privileged information main contribution new perspective connect previously isolate approach ii insight method incorporate different type prior knowledge hence implement different pattern iii facilitate application method novel task well iv systematic experimental evaluation pattern two supervise learn task
