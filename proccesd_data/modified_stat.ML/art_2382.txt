 explorative data analysis change neural activity neural recording nonstationary time series i.e property typically change time identify specific change e.g induce learning task shed light underlying neural process however change interest often mask strong unrelated change physiological origin due measurement artifact propose novel algorithm disentangle different cause non-stationarity manner enable well neurophysiological interpretation wider set experimental paradigm key ingredient repeated application stationary subspace analysis ssa use different temporal scale usefulness explorative approach demonstrate simulation theory eeg experiment brain-computer-interfacing bci subject
