 tree-dependent component analysis present generalization independent component analysis ica instead look linear transform make data component independent look transform make data component well fit tree-structured graphical model treat problem semiparametric statistical problem show optimal transform find minimize contrast function base mutual information function directly extend contrast function use classical ica provide two approximation contrast function one use kernel density estimation another use kernel generalize variance tree-dependent component analysis framework lead naturally efficient general multivariate density estimation technique bivariate density estimation need perform
