 nonparametric estimation multi-view latent variable model spectral method greatly advance estimation latent variable model generate sequence novel efficient algorithm strong theoretical guarantee however current spectral algorithm largely restrict mixture discrete gaussian distribution paper propose kernel method learn multi-view latent variable model allow mixture component nonparametric key idea method embed joint distribution multi-view latent variable reproducing kernel hilbert space latent parameter recover use robust tensor power method establish sample complexity propose method quadratic number latent component low order polynomial relevant parameter thus non-parametric tensor approach learn latent variable model enjoy good sample computational efficiency moreover non-parametric tensor power method compare favorably em algorithm exist spectral algorithm experiment
