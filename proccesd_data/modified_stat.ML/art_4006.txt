 deep information propagation study behavior untrained neural network whose weight bias randomly distribute use mean field theory show existence depth scale naturally limit maximum depth signal propagation random network main practical result show random network may train precisely information travel thus depth scale identify provide bound deep network may train specific choice hyperparameters corollary argue network edge chaos one depth scale diverges thus arbitrarily deep network may train sufficiently close criticality show presence dropout destroy order-to-chaos critical point therefore strongly limit maximum trainable depth random network finally develop mean field theory backpropagation show ordered chaotic phase correspond region vanish explode gradient respectively
