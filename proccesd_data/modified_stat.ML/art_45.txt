 forest garrote variable selection high-dimensional linear model receive lot attention lately mostly context l -regularization part attraction variable selection effect parsimonious model obtain suitable interpretation term predictive power however regularize linear model often slightly inferior machine learning procedure like tree ensemble tree ensemble hand lack usually formal way variable selection difficult visualize garrote-style convex penalty tree ensemble particular random forest propose penalty select functional group node tree could simple monotone function individual predictor variable yield parsimonious function fit lend easily visualization interpretation predictive power maintain least level original tree ensemble key feature method tree ensemble fit tuning parameter need select empirical performance demonstrate wide array datasets
