 estimate coefficient mixture two linear regression expectation maximization give convergence guarantee estimate coefficient symmetric mixture two linear regression expectation maximization em particular show empirical em iterates converge target parameter vector parametric rate provide algorithm initialize unbounded cone particular initial guess sufficiently large cosine angle target parameter vector sample-splitting version em algorithm converges true coefficient vector high probability interestingly analysis borrow tool use problem estimate center symmetric mixture two gaussians em also show population em operator mixture two regression anti-contractive target parameter vector cosine angle input vector target parameter vector small thereby establish necessity conic condition finally give empirical evidence support theoretical observation suggest sample base em algorithm performs poorly initial guess draw accordingly simulation study also suggest em algorithm performs well even model misspecification i.e. covariate error distribution violate model assumption
