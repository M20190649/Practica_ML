 spectral dimensionality reduction hmms hidden markov model hmms accurately approximated use co-occurrence frequency pair triple observation use fast spectral method contrast usual slow method like em gibbs sampling provide new spectral method significantly reduce number model parameter need estimate generate sample complexity depend size observation vocabulary present elementary proof give bound relative accuracy probability estimate model correlaries show bound weaken provide either l bound kl bound provide easy direct comparison previous work theorem us condition checkable data instead put condition unobservable markov transition matrix
