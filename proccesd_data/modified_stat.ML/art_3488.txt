 select best system multi-armed bandit consider problem find population probability distribution amongst many large mean mean unknown population sample simulate otherwise generate typically select large sample mean population show false selection probability decay exponential rate lately researcher seek algorithm guarantee probability restrict small delta order log delta computational time estimate associate large deviation rate function via simulation show guarantee mislead population unbounded support even may light-tailed specifically show policy identify correct population probability least delta problem instance require infinite number sample expectation make determination problem instance suggest restriction essential population devise log delta algorithm delta correctness guarantee note restriction population moment method easily design sequential method stochastic multi-armed bandit literature adapt devise algorithm
