 orthogonal parallel mcmc method sample optimization monte carlo mc method widely use bayesian inference optimization statistic signal processing machine learning well-known class mc method markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm order foster good exploration state space specially high-dimensional application several scheme employ multiple parallel mcmc chain recently introduce work describe novel parallel interact mcmc scheme call orthogonal mcmc o-mcmc set vertical parallel mcmc chain share information use horizontal mcmc technique work entire population current state specifically vertical chain lead random-walk proposal whereas horizontal mcmc technique employ independent proposal thus allow efficient combination global exploration local approximation interaction contain horizontal iteration within analysis different implementation o-mcmc novel scheme order reduce overall computational cost parallel multiple try metropolis mtm chain also present furthermore modified version o-mcmc optimization provide consider parallel simulate anneal sa algorithm numerical result show advantage propose sampling scheme term efficiency estimation well robustness term independence respect initial value choice parameter
