 implicitly constrain semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis semi-supervised learning important active topic research pattern recognition classification use linear discriminant analysis specifically several semi-supervised variant propose use one method guarantee outperform supervise classifier take additional unlabeled data account work compare traditional expectation maximization type approach semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis approach base intrinsic constraint propose new principled approach semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis use so-called implicit constraint explore relationship method consider question sense expect improvement performance supervised procedure constraint base approach robust misspecification model may outperform alternative make assumption data term log-likelihood unseen object
