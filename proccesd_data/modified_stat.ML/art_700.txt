 pca-based out-of-sample extension dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction method common field high dimensional data analysis typically algorithm dimensionality reduction computationally expensive therefore application analysis massive amount data impractical example repeat computation due accumulate data computationally prohibitive paper out-of-sample extension scheme use complementary method dimensionality reduction present describe algorithm perform out-of-sample extension newly-arrived data point unlike extension algorithm nystr om algorithm propose algorithm use intrinsic geometry data property dimensionality reduction map prove error propose algorithm bound additionally out-of-sample extension algorithm provide degree abnormality newly-arrived data point
