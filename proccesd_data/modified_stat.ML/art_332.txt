 multiple kernel learn brain-computer interfacing combine information different source common way improve classification accuracy brain-computer interfacing bci instance small sample setting useful integrate data subject session order improve estimation quality spatial filter classifier since data different subject may show large variability crucial weight contribution accord importance many multi-subject learn algorithms determine optimal weighting separate step use heuristic however without ensure select weight optimal respect classification work apply multiple kernel learn mkl problem mkl widely use feature fusion computer vision allow simultaneously learn classifier optimal weighting compare mkl method two baseline approach investigate reason performance improvement
