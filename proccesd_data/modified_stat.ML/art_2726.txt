 multimodal transition generative stochastic network generative stochastic network gsns recently introduce alternative traditional probabilistic modeling instead parametrizing data distribution directly one parametrizes transition operator markov chain whose stationary distribution estimator data generate distribution result training therefore machine generate sample markov chain however previously introduce gsn consistency theorems suggest order capture wide class distribution transition operator general multimodal something do paper introduce first time multimodal transition distribution gsns particular use model nade family neural autoregressive density estimator output distribution transition operator nade model relate rbm thus model multimodal distribution likelihood likelihood gradient compute easily parameter nade obtain learned function previous state learned markov chain experiment clearly illustrate advantage multimodal transition distribution unimodal gsns
