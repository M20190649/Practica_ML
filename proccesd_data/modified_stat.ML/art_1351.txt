 adversarial example uncertainty transfer test robustness gaussian process hybrid deep network deep neural network dnns excellent representative power state art classifier many task however often capture uncertainty well make less robust real world overconfidently extrapolate notice domain shift gaussian process gps rbf kernel hand well calibrate uncertainty overconfidently extrapolate far data training set however gps poor representational power perform well dnns complex domain paper show gp hybrid deep network gpdnns gps top dnns trained end-to-end inherit nice property gps dnns much robust adversarial example extrapolate adversarial example test domain shift setting gpdnns frequently output high entropy class probability correspond essentially n't know gpdnns therefore promising deep architecture know n't know
