 markov jump process efficient hamiltonian monte carlo sampling algorithm include hamiltonian monte carlo transition rate state correspond probability make transition single time step constrain less equal derive hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm use continuous time markov jump process thus able escape constraint transition rate markov jump process need non-negative demonstrate new algorithm lead improve mixing several example problem evaluate spectral gap markov operator compute autocorrelation function compute time release algorithm open source python package
