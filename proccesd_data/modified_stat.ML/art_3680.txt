 sparse linear model apply power quality disturbance classification power quality pq analysis describe non-pure electric signal usually present electric power system automatic recognition pq disturbance see pattern recognition problem different type waveform distortion differentiate base feature similar quasi-stationary signal pq disturbance decompose time-frequency dependent component use time-frequency time-scale transforms also know dictionary dictionary use feature extraction step pattern recognition system short-time fourier wavelet stockwell transforms common dictionary use pq community aim achieve good signal representation best knowledge previous work pq disturbance classification restrict use one among several available dictionary take advantage theory behind sparse linear model slm introduce sparse method pq representation start overcomplete dictionary particular apply group lasso employ different type time-frequency time-scale dictionary characterize pq disturbance evaluate performance different pattern recognition algorithm show slm reduce pq classification complexity promote sparse basis selection improve classification accuracy
