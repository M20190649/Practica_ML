 regularize auto-encoders learn data generate distribution auto-encoders learn underlie data generate distribution recent work suggest auto-encoder variant good job capture local manifold structure data paper clarify previous observation show minimize particular form regularized reconstruction error yield reconstruction function locally characterize shape data generate density show auto-encoder capture score derivative log-density respect input contradict previous interpretation reconstruction error energy function unlike previous result theorem provide completely generic depend parametrization auto-encoder show auto-encoder would tend give enough capacity example result contractive training criterion show similar denoising auto-encoder training criterion small corruption noise contraction apply whole reconstruction function rather encoder similarly score matching one consider propose training criterion convenient alternative maximum likelihood involve partition function finally show approximate metropolis-hastings mcmc setup recover sample estimate distribution confirm sample experiment
