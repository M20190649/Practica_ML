 linear dimensionality reduction linear time johnson-lindenstrauss-type guarantee random subspace consider problem efficient randomize dimensionality reduction norm-preservation guarantee specifically prove data-dependent johnson-lindenstrauss-type geometry preservation guarantee ho 's random subspace method data satisfy mild regularity condition -- extent estimate sample data -- random subspace approximately preserve euclidean geometry data high probability guarantee order random projection namely required dimension projection logarithmic number data point large constant term bound depend upon regularity challenging situation original data sparse representation since imply large projection dimension require show situation improve sparse binary data apply efficient densifying preprocessing neither change euclidean geometry data require explicit matrix-matrix multiplication corroborate theoretical finding experiment dense sparse high-dimensional datasets several application domain
