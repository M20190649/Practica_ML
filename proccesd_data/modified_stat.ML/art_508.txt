 manifold match use shortest-path distance joint neighborhood selection match datasets multiple modality become important task data analysis exist method often rely embedding transformation single modality without utilize correspondence information often result sub-optimal matching performance paper propose nonlinear manifold match algorithm use shortest-path distance joint neighborhood selection specifically joint nearest-neighbor graph build modality shortest-path distance within modality calculate joint neighborhood graph follow embed match common low-dimensional euclidean space compare exist algorithm approach exhibit superior performance match disparate datasets multiple modality
