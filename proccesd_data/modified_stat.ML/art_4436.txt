 variational inference gaussian process model linear complexity large-scale gaussian process inference long face practical challenge due time space complexity superlinear dataset size sparse variational gaussian process model capable learn large-scale data standard strategy sparsifying model prevent approximation complex function work propose novel variational gaussian process model decouple representation mean covariance function reproduce kernel hilbert space show new parametrization generalize previous model furthermore yield variational inference problem solve stochastic gradient ascent time space complexity linear number mean function parameter regardless choice kernel likelihood induce point strategy make adoption large-scale expressive gaussian process model possible run several experiment regression task show decoupled approach greatly outperform previous sparse variational gaussian process inference procedure
