 efficient coordinate-descent orthogonal matrix given rotation optimize set orthogonal matrix central component problem like sparse-pca tensor decomposition unfortunately optimization hard since simple operation orthogonal matrix easily break orthogonality correct orthogonality usually cost large amount computation propose framework optimize orthogonal matrix parallel coordinate-descent euclidean space base em givens-rotations fast-to-compute operation affect small number entry learned matrix preserve orthogonality show two application approach algorithm tensor decomposition use learn mixture model algorithm sparse-pca study parameter regime givens rotation approach converges faster achieve superior model genome-wide brain-wide mrna expression dataset
