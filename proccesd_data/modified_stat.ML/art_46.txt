 feature importance ranking measure accurate prediction typically obtain learn machine complex feature space e.g induce kernel unfortunately decision rule hardly accessible human easily use gain insight application domain therefore one often resort linear model combination variable selection thereby sacrifice predictive power presumptive interpretability introduce feature importance ranking measure firm retrospective analysis arbitrary learn machine allows achieve excellent predictive performance superior interpretation contrast standard raw feature weighting firm take underlying correlation structure feature account thereby able discover relevant feature even appearance training data entirely prevent noise desirable property firm investigate analytically illustrate simulation
