 bregman variational dual-tree framework graph-based method provide powerful tool set many non-parametric framework machine learning general memory computational complexity method quadratic number example data make quickly infeasible moderate large scale datasets significant effort find efficient solution problem make literature one state-of-the-art method recently introduce variational dual-tree vdt framework despite unique feature vdt currently restrict euclidean space euclidean distance quantify similarity paper extend vdt framework beyond euclidean distance general bregman divergences include euclidean distance special case exploit property general bregman divergence show new framework maintain pivotal feature vdt framework yet significantly improve performance non-euclidean domain apply propose framework different text categorization problem demonstrate benefit original vdt
