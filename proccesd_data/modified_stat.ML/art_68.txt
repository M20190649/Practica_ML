 causal inference discrete data use additive noise model infer causal structure set random variable finite sample joint distribution important problem science recently method use additive noise model suggest approach case continuous variable many situation however variable interest discrete even finitely many state work extend notion additive noise model case prove whenever joint distribution prob x admits model one direction e.g f x n n independent x admit reversed model x g tilde n tilde n independent long model choose generic way base deliberation propose efficient new algorithm able distinguish cause effect finite sample discrete variable extensive experimental study show algorithm work synthetic real data set
