 sparse pseudo-input local kriging large spatial datasets exogenous variable study large-scale spatial system contain exogenous variable e.g environmental factor significant predictor spatial process build predictive model process challenge large number observation present make inefficient apply full kriging order reduce computational complexity paper propose sparse pseudo-input local kriging splk utilize hyperplanes partition domain small subdomains apply sparse approximation full kriging subdomain also develop optimization procedure find desired hyperplanes alleviate problem discontinuity global predictor impose continuity constraint boundary neighboring subdomains furthermore partition domain small subdomains make possible use different parameter value covariance function region therefore heterogeneity data structure effectively capture numerical experiment demonstrate splk outperforms comparable algorithm commonly apply spatial datasets
