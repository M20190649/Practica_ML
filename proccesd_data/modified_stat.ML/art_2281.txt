 fast graph construction use auction algorithm practical machine learn system graph base data representation widely use various learn paradigm range unsupervised cluster supervise classification besides application natural graph network structure data social network analysis relational learning many application often involve critical step convert data vector adjacency graph particular sparse subgraph extract original graph often require due theoretic practical need previous study clearly show performance different learn algorithm e.g. cluster classification benefit sparse subgraphs balanced node connectivity however exist graph construction method either computationally expensive unsatisfactory performance paper utilize scalable method call auction algorithm parallel extension recover sparse yet nearly balance subgraph significantly reduce computational cost empirical study comparison state-ofart approach clearly demonstrate superiority propose method efficiency accuracy
