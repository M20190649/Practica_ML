 improve variational inference inverse autoregressive flow framework normalize flow provide general strategy flexible variational inference posterior latent variable propose new type normalize flow inverse autoregressive flow iaf contrast earlier publish flow scale well high-dimensional latent space propose flow consist chain invertible transformation transformation base autoregressive neural network experiment show iaf significantly improve upon diagonal gaussian approximate posterior addition demonstrate novel type variational autoencoder couple iaf competitive neural autoregressive model term attain log-likelihood natural image allow significantly fast synthesis
