 distributionally ambiguous optimization technique batch bayesian optimization propose novel theoretically-grounded acquisition function batch bayesian optimization inform insight distributionally ambiguous optimization acquisition function low bound well-known expected improvement function require evaluation gaussian expectation multivariate piecewise affine function bound compute instead evaluate best-case expectation probability distribution consistent mean variance original gaussian distribution unlike alternative approach include expect improvement propose acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integration entirely compute exactly even large batch size solution tractable convex optimization problem suggested acquisition function also optimize efficiently since first second derivative information calculate inexpensively by-product acquisition function calculation derive various novel theorem grind work theoretically demonstrate superior performance via simple motivating example benchmark function real-world problem
