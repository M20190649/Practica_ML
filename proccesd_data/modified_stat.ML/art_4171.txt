 recursive multikernel filter exploit nonlinear temporal structure kernel method temporal information data commonly include use time-delayed embeddings input recently alternative formulation propose define gamma-filter explicitly reproducing kernel hilbert space give rise complex model multiple kernel operate different temporal combination input signal original formulation kernel simply combine obtain single kernel matrix instance average provide computational benefit discard important information temporal structure signal inspire work multiple kernel learn overcome drawback consider different kernel separately propose efficient strategy adaptively combine select kernel training phase result batch online algorithm automatically learn process highly nonlinear temporal information extract input signal implicitly encode kernel value evaluate proposal several artificial real task show outperform classical approach batch online setting
