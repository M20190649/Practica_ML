 sparsity base method overparameterized variational problem two complementary approach extensively use signal image processing lead novel result sparse representation methodology variational strategy recently new sparsity base model propose cosparse analysis framework may potentially help bridge sparse approximation base method traditional total-variation minimization base introduce sparsity base framework solve overparameterized variational problem latter use improve estimation optical flow also general denoising signal image however recovery space vary parameter involve adequately address traditional variational method first demonstrate efficiency new framework one dimensional signal recover piecewise linear polynomial function illustrate new technique use denoising segmentation image
