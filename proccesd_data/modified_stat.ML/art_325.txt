 alternate minimization mixed linear regression mixed linear regression involve recovery two unknown vector unlabeled linear measurement sample come exactly one vector know one classic problem natural empirically popular approach solution em algorithm setting prone bad local minimum however iteration fast alternating guess label solve label paper provide new initialization procedure em base find lead two eigenvectors appropriate matrix show re-sampled version em algorithm provably converge correct vector natural assumption sampling distribution nearly optimal unimprovable sample complexity provide first characterization em 's performance also much low sample complexity compare standard randomly initialize em method problem
