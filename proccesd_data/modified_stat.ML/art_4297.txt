 discrimination-generalization tradeoff gans generative adversarial training generally understood minimize certain moment matching loss define set discriminator function typically neural network discriminator set large enough able uniquely identify true distribution discriminative also small enough go beyond memorize sample generalizable paper show discriminator set guarantee discriminative whenever linear span dense set bounded continuous function mild condition satisfy even neural network single neuron develop generalization bound learned distribution true distribution different evaluation metric evaluate neural distance bound show generalization guarantee long discriminator set small enough regardless size generator hypothesis set evaluate kl divergence bound provide explanation counter-intuitive behavior test likelihood gan training analysis shed light understand practical performance gans
