 systematic ensemble learning regression motivation work improve performance standard stack approach ensemble compose simple heterogeneous base model integration generation selection stage regression problem propose two extension standard stack approach first extension combine set standard stack approach ensemble ensemble use two-step ensemble learning regression setting second extension consist two part initial part diversity mechanism inject original training data set systematically generate different train subset partition correspond ensemble ensemble final part measure quality different partition ensemble max-min rule-based selection algorithm use select appropriate ensemble partition make final prediction show base experiment broad range data set second extension performs well best standard stacking approach good oracle database best base model select cross-validation data set addition second extension performs well two state-of-the-art ensemble method regression good third state-of-the-art ensemble method
