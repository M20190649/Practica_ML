 forecasting granger model non-linear dynamical dependency traditional linear method forecast multivariate time series able satisfactorily model non-linear dependency may exist non-gaussian series build theory learn vector-valued function reproducing kernel hilbert space develop method learn prediction function accommodate non-linearities method learn predictive function also matrix-valued kernel underlie function search space directly data approach base learn multiple matrix-valued kernel compose set input kernel set output kernel learn cone positive semi-definite matrix addition superior predictive performance presence strong non-linearities method also recover hidden dynamic relationship series thus new alternative exist graphical granger technique
