 theoretical experimental comparison em sem algorithm paper provide new analysis sem algorithm unlike previous work focus analysis single run algorithm first discuss algorithm general mixture distribution second consider gaussian mixture model show high probability update equation em algorithm stochastic variant almost give input set sufficiently large experiment confirm still hold large number successive update step particular gaussian mixture model show stochastic variant run nearly twice fast
