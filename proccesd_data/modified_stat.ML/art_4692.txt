 accelerate randomized mirror descent algorithm composite non-strongly convex optimization consider problem minimize sum average function large number smooth convex component general possibly non-differentiable convex function although many method propose solve problem assumption sum strongly convex method support non-strongly convex case add small quadratic regularization common devise use tackle non-strongly convex problem however may cause loss sparsity solution weaken performance algorithm avoid devise propose accelerated randomized mirror descent method solve problem without strongly convex assumption method extend deterministic accelerate proximal gradient method paul tseng apply even proximal point compute inexactly also propose scheme solve problem component function non-smooth
