 unbounded bayesian optimization via regularization bayesian optimization recently emerge popular efficient tool global optimization hyperparameter tuning currently establish bayesian optimization practice require user-defined bounding box assume contain optimizer however little know probed objective function difficult prescribe bound work modify standard bayesian optimization framework principled way allow automatic resizing search space introduce two alternative method compare two common synthetic benchmarking test function well task tune stochastic gradient descent optimizer multi-layered perceptron convolutional neural network mnist
