 asymmetric distribution constrain mixture paper introduces constrain mixture continuous distribution characterize mixture distribution distribution shape similar base distribution disjoint domain new concept use create generalized asymmetric version laplace normal distribution show define exponential family know conjugate prior maximum likelihood estimate original parameter know closed-form expression asymmetric symmetric normal distribution compare linear regression example show asymmetric version performs least well symmetric one real world time-series problem hidden markov model use fit stock index indicate asymmetric version provide high likelihood may learn distribution model state transition distribution considerably less entropy
