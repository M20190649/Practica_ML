 nonparametric detection anomalous data stream nonparametric anomalous hypothesis test problem investigate totally n sequence anomalous sequence detect typical sequence contains independent identically distribute i.i.d sample draw distribution p whereas anomalous sequence contains i.i.d sample draw distribution q distinct p. distribution p q assume unknown advance distribution-free test construct use maximum mean discrepancy metric base mean embeddings distribution reproducing kernel hilbert space probability error bound function sample size number anomalous sequence number n sequence show know constructed test exponentially consistent great constant factor log n p q whereas unknown order strictly great log n. furthermore show test consistent arbitrary p q less constant factor log n thus order-level optimality propose test establish numerical result provide demonstrate test outperform perform well test base competitive approach various case
