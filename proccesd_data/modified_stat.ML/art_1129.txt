 discovering decipher relationship across disparate data modality understand relationship different property data whether connectome genome information disease status become increasingly important modern biological datasets exist approach test whether two property relate often require unfeasibly large sample size real data scenario provide insight procedure reach decision approach multiscale graph correlation mgc dependence test juxtapose previously disparate data science technique include k-nearest neighbor kernel method support vector machine multiscale analysis wavelet method typically require double triple number sample achieve statistical power mgc benchmark suite include high-dimensional nonlinear relationship span polynomial linear quadratic cubic trigonometric sinusoidal circular ellipsoidal spiral geometric square diamond w-shape function dimensionality range moreover mgc uniquely provide simple elegant characterization potentially complex latent geometry underlie relationship provide insight maintain computational efficiency several real data application include brain imaging cancer genetics mgc method detect presence dependency provide specific guidance next experiment analysis conduct
