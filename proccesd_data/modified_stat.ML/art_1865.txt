 semi-supervised learning density base distance present simple yet effective approach semi-supervised learning approach base estimate density-based distance dbd use short path calculation graph graph-dbd estimate use distance-based supervised learning method near neighbor method svms rbf kernel order apply method large data set also present novel algorithm integrate near neighbor computation short path search find exact short path even extremely large dense graph significant runtime improvement commonly used laplacian regularization method show large scale dataset
