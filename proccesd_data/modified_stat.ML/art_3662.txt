 neural network-based cluster use pairwise constraint paper present neural network-based end-to-end clustering framework design novel strategy utilize contrastive criterion push data-forming cluster directly raw data addition learn feature embed suitable clustering network train weak label specifically partial pairwise relationship data instance cluster assignment probability obtain output layer feed-forwarding data framework interesting characteristic cluster center need explicitly specify thus result cluster distribution purely data-driven distance metric need predefined experiment show propose approach beat conventional two-stage method feature embed k-means significant margin also compare favorably performance standard cross entropy loss classification robustness analysis also show method largely insensitive number cluster specifically show number dominant cluster close true number cluster even large k use cluster
