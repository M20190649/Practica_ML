 additive model trend filter study additive model build trend filtering i.e. additive model whose component regularize discrete total variation k th discrete derivative chosen integer k geq result k th degree piecewise polynomial component e.g. k give piecewise constant component k give piecewise linear k give piecewise quadratic etc analogous advantage univariate case additive trend filtering favorable theoretical computational property thanks large part localized nature discrete total variation regularizer use theory side derive fast error rate additive trend filtering estimate show rate minimax optimal underlying function additive component function whose derivative bounded variation also show rate unattainable additive smoothing spline additive model build linear smoother general computational side per standard additive model backfitting appeal method optimization particularly appeal additive trend filtering leverage highly efficient univariate trend filter solver go one step describe new backfitting algorithm whose iteration run parallel far know first kind lastly present experiment examine empirical performance additive trend filtering
