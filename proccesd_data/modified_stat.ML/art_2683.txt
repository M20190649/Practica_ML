 pac-bayesian bound lifelong learn transfer learning receive lot attention machine learn community last year several effective algorithm develop however relatively little know theoretical property especially setting lifelong learning goal transfer information task data observe far work study lifelong learning theoretical perspective main result pac-bayesian generalization bound offer unified view exist paradigm transfer learning transfer parameter transfer low-dimensional representation also use bound derive two principled lifelong learn algorithm show yield result comparable exist method
