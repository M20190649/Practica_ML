 intersection property conditional independence application causal discovery work investigate intersection property conditional independence state random variable b c x x independent give b c x independent b give c implies x independent b give c assumption joint distribution continuous density provide necessary sufficient condition intersection property hold result direct application causal inference lead strictly weak condition graphical structure become identifiable joint distribution additive noise model
