 semi-supervised learning class balance class-prior change distribution match real-world classification problem class balance training dataset necessarily reflect test dataset cause significant estimation bias class ratio test dataset know instance re-weighting resampling allows systematical bias correction however learn class ratio test dataset challenge label data available test domain paper propose estimate class ratio test dataset match probability distribution training test input data demonstrate utility propose approach experiment
