 bayesian optimization mixed constraint slack-variable augmented lagrangian augmented lagrangian al convert constrained optimization problem sequence simpler e.g. unconstrained problem usually solve local solver recently surrogate-based bayesian optimization bo sub-solvers successfully deploy al framework global search presence inequality constraint however drawback expect improvement ei evaluation rely monte carlo introduce alternative slack variable al show formulation ei may evaluate library routine slack variables furthermore facilitate equality well inequality constraint mixture thereof show new slack albo compare favorably original superiority conventional alternative reinforce several mixed constraint example
