 fix point belief propagation -- analysis via polynomial homotopy continuation belief propagation bp iterative method perform approximate inference arbitrary graphical model whether bp converges solution unique fix point depend structure parametrization model understand dependence interest find emph fixed point work formulate set polynomial equation solution correspond bp fixed point solve nonlinear system present numerical polynomial-homotopy-continuation nphc method experiment binary ising model error-correcting code show method capable obtain bp fix point ising model fixed parameter show structure influence number fixed point convergence property asses accuracy marginals weighted combination thereof weight marginals respective partition function increase accuracy experiment contrary conjecture uniqueness bp fix point implies convergence find graph bp fail converge even though unique fix point exists moreover show fixed point give good approximation nphc method able obtain fixed point
