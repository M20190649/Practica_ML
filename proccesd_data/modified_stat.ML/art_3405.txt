 error random fourier feature kernel method give powerful flexible theoretically ground approach solve many problem machine learning standard approach however require pairwise evaluation kernel function lead scalability issue large datasets rahimi recht suggest popular approach handle problem know random fourier feature quality approximation however well understood improve uniform error bound paper well give novel understanding embedding 's variance approximation error use machine learn method also point surprisingly two main variant feature widely use strictly higher-variance gaussian kernel bad bound
