 mtim rapid accurate transcript reconstruction rna-seq data recent advance high-throughput cdna sequence rna-seq technology revolutionize transcriptome study major motivation rna-seq map structure expressed transcript nucleotide resolution accurate computational tool transcript reconstruction technology may also become useful genome re- annotation mostly rely de novo gene find gene structure primarily infer genome sequence develop machine-learning method call mtim margin-based transcript inference method transcript reconstruction rna-seq read alignment base discriminatively train hidden markov support vector machine addition feature derive read alignment utilize characteristic genomic sequence e.g around splice site improve transcript prediction mtim infer transcript highly accurate relatively robust alignment error comparison cufflink widely use transcript assembly method
