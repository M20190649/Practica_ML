 active learning halfspaces margin assumption derive analyze new efficient pool-based active learning algorithm halfspaces call aluma previous algorithm show exponential improvement label complexity assume distribution instance space close uniform assumption rarely hold practical application instead study label complexity large-margin assumption -- much realistic condition evident success margin-based algorithm svm algorithm computationally efficient come formal guarantee label complexity also naturally extend non-separable case non-linear kernel experiment illustrate clear advantage aluma active learn algorithm
