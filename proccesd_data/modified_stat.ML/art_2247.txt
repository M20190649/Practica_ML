 minimize inter-subject variability fnirs base brain computer interface via multiple-kernel support vector learn brain signal variability measurement obtain different subject different session significantly deteriorate accuracy brain-computer interface bci system moreover variability also know inter-subject inter-session variability require lengthy calibration session bci system use furthermore calibration session repeat subject independently use bci due inter-session variability study present algorithm order minimize above-mentioned variability overcome time-consuming usually error-prone calibration time algorithm base linear program support-vector machine extension multiple kernel learning framework tackle inter-subject -session variability feature space classifier do incorporate subject- session-specific feature space much rich feature space set optimal decision boundary decision boundary represent subject- session specific spatio-temporal variability neural signal consequently single classifier multiple feature space generalize well new unseen test pattern even without calibration step demonstrate classifier maintain good performance even presence large degree bci variability present study analyze bci variability relate oxy-hemoglobin neural signal measure use functional near-infrared spectroscopy
