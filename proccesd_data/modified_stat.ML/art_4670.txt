 unbiased split variable selection random survival forest use maximally select rank statistic popular approach analyze survival data cox regression model cox model may however misspecified proportionality assumption may always fulfil alternative approach survival prediction random forest survival outcome standard split criterion random survival forest log-rank test statistic favor split variable many possible split point conditional inference forest avoid split variable selection bias however linear rank statistic utilize default conditional inference forest select optimal splitting variable detect non-linear effect independent variable alternative use maximally select rank statistic split point selection conditional inference forest split variable compare p-value scale however instead conditional monte-carlo approach use conditional inference forest p-value approximation employ describe several p-value approximation implementation propose random forest approach simulation study demonstrate unbiased split variable selection possible however trade-off unbiased split variable selection runtime benchmark study prediction performance simulated real datasets new method performs well random survival forest informative dichotomous variable combine uninformative variable category good conditional inference forest non-linear covariate effect include runtime comparison method prove computationally fast alternative simple p-value approximation use
