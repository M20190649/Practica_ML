 conservative bandit study novel multi-armed bandit problem model challenge face company wish explore new strategy maximize revenue whilst simultaneously maintain revenue fixed baseline uniformly time previous work address problem weak requirement maintain revenue constraint give fixed time future algorithm previously propose unsuitable due design stringent constraint consider stochastic adversarial setting propose natural yet novel strategy analyze price maintain constraint amongst thing prove high probability expectation bound regret also consider problem maintain constraint high probability expectation adversarial set price maintain constraint appear high least algorithm consider low bound give show algorithm stochastic setting almost optimal empirical result obtain synthetic environment complement theoretical finding
