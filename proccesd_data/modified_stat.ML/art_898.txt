 efficient manifold subspace approximation spherelets data lie high dimensional ambient space commonly think much low intrinsic dimension particular data may concentrate near lower-dimensional subspace manifold immense literature focus approximate unknown subspace exploit approximation clustering data compression building predictive model literature rely approximate subspace use locally linear potentially multiscale dictionary article propose simple general alternative instead use piece sphere spherelets locally approximate unknown subspace theory develop show spherelets produce low cover number ms many manifold develop spherical principal component analysis spca result relative state-of-the-art competitor show gain ability accurately approximate subspace few component addition unlike competitor approach use data denoising efficiently embed new data without retrain method illustrate standard toy manifold learning example application multiple real data set
