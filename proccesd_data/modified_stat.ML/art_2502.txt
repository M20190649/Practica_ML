 meta path-based collective classification heterogeneous information network collective classification intensively study due impact many important application web mining bioinformatics citation analysis collective classification approach exploit dependency group link object whose class label correlate need predict simultaneously paper focus study collective classification problem heterogeneous network involve multiple type data object interconnect multiple type link intuitively two object correlate link many path network however exist approach measure dependency among object directly link indirect link without consider different semantic meaning behind different path paper study collective classification problem taht define among type object heterogenous network moreover consider different linkage path network one capture subtlety different type dependency among object introduce concept meta-path base dependency among object meta path path consist certain sequence linke type show quality collective classification result strongly depend upon meta path use accommodate large network size novel solution call hcc meta-path base heterogenous collective classification develop effectively assign label group instance interconnect different meta-paths propose hcc model capture different type dependency among object respect different meta path empirical study real-world network demonstrate effectiveness propose meta path-based collective classification approach
