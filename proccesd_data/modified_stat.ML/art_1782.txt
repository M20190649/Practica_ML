 unsupervised k-nearest neighbor regression many scientific discipline structure high-dimensional data find e.g. stellar spectrum genome data face recognition task work present novel approach non-linear dimensionality reduction base fit k-nearest neighbor regression unsupervised regression framework learning low-dimensional manifold similar related approach mostly base kernel method unsupervised k-nearest neighbor unn regression optimize latent variable w.r.t data space reconstruction error employ k-nearest neighbor heuristic problem optimize latent neighborhood difficult solve unn formulation allow design efficient strategy iteratively embed latent point fix neighborhood topology unn well appropriate sort high-dimensional data iterative variant analyze experimentally
