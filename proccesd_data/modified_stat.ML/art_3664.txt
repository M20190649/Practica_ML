 iterative refinement approximate posterior directed belief network variational method rely recognition network approximate posterior directed graphical model offer good inference learning previous method recent advance exploit capacity flexibility approach expand kind model train however proposal posterior capacity recognition network limit constrain representational power generative model increase variance monte carlo estimate address issue introduce iterative refinement procedure improve approximate posterior recognition network show train refined posterior competitive state-of-the-art method advantage refinement evident increased effective sample size imply low variance gradient estimate
