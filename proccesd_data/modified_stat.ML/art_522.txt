 equitability dependence measure measure dependence two random variable important critical many applied area variable selection brain network analysis however know kind functional relationship two covariates require dependence measure equitable give similar score equally noisy relationship different type fact dependence score continuous random variable take value thus theoretically impossible give similar score paper introduce new definition equitability dependence measure i.e power-equitable weak-equitable show simulation hhg copula dependence coefficient cdc weak-equitable
