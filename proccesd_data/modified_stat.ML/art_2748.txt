 inference high dimension penalize score test recent year considerable theoretical development regard variable selection consistency penalized regression technique lasso however relatively little work quantify uncertainty selection procedure paper propose new method inference high dimension use score test base penalized regression test perform penalized regression outcome single feature test correlation residual held-out feature procedure apply feature turn interestingly ell penalty use sparsity pattern lasso corresponds exactly decision base propose test ell penalty use test correspond precisely score test mixed effect model effect one feature assume random formulate hypothesis test compromise null hypothesis test simple linear regression feature multiple linear regression feature develop reference distribution well-known penalty also examine behavior test real simulate data
