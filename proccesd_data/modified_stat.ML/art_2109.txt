 cross-domain multitask learn latent probit model learn multiple task across heterogeneous domain challenging problem since feature space may different task assume data multiple task generate latent common domain via sparse domain transforms propose latent probit model lpm jointly learn domain transforms share probit classifier common domain learn meaningful task relatedness avoid over-fitting classification introduce sparsity domain transforms matrix well common classifier derive theoretical bound estimation error classifier term sparsity domain transforms expectation-maximization algorithm derive learn lpm effectiveness approach demonstrate several real datasets
