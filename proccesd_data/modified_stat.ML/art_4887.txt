 high-dimensional regression adjustment randomized experiment study problem treatment effect estimation randomized experiment high-dimensional covariate information show essentially risk-consistent regression adjustment use obtain efficient estimate average treatment effect result considerably extend range setting high-dimensional regression adjustment guarantee provide valid inference population average treatment effect propose cross-estimation simple method obtain finite-sample-unbiased treatment effect estimate leverage high-dimensional regression adjustment method use regression model estimate use lasso elastic net subset selection etc finally extend analysis allow adaptive specification search via cross-validation flexible non-parametric regression adjustment machine learn method random forest neural network
