 demixing structure superposition signal periodic aperiodic nonlinear observation consider demixing problem two structured high-dimensional vector limited number nonlinear observation nonlinearity due either periodic aperiodic function study certain family structured superposition model propose method provably recover component give nearly mathcal sample denote sparsity level underlying component strictly improve upon previous nonlinear demixing technique asymptotically match best possible sample complexity also provide range simulation illustrate performance propose algorithm
