 tree exploration bayesian rl exploration research reinforcement learning produce algorithm optimal decision make uncertainty fall within two main type first employ bayesian framework optimality improve increased computational time result planning task take form dynamic programming problem belief tree infinite number state second type employ relatively simple algorithm show suffer small regret within distribution-free framework paper present low bound high probability upper bound optimal value function node bayesian belief tree analogous similar bound pomdps bound use create efficient strategy explore tree resulting algorithm compare distribution-free algorithm ucb well simpler baseline algorithm multi-armed bandit problem
