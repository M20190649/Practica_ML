 alternative em gaussian mixture model batch stochastic riemannian optimization consider maximum likelihood estimation gaussian mixture model gmms task almost invariably solve theory practice via expectation maximization em algorithm em owe success various factor ability fulfill positive definiteness constraint closed form key importance propose alternative em appeal rich riemannian geometry positive definite matrix use cast gmm parameter estimation riemannian optimization problem surprisingly out-of-the-box riemannian formulation completely fails prove much inferior em motivate u take close look problem geometry derive good formulation much amenable riemannian optimization develop riemannian batch stochastic gradient algorithm outperform em often substantially provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis stochastic method also first knowledge global analysis riemannian stochastic gradient numerous empirical result include demonstrate effectiveness method
