 dependent indian buffet process-based sparse nonparametric nonnegative matrix factorization nonnegative matrix factorization nmf aim factorize matrix two optimized nonnegative matrix appropriate intended application method widely use unsupervised learning task include recommender system rating matrix user item document cluster weight matrix paper keywords however traditional nmf method typically assume number latent factor i.e. dimensionality loading matrix fix assumption make inflexible many application paper propose nonparametric nmf framework mitigate issue use dependent indian buffet process dibp nutshell apply correlation function generation two stick weight associate pair column load matrix still maintain respective marginal distribution specify ibp consequence generation two load matrix column-wise indirectly correlate framework two class correlation function propose use bivariate beta distribution use copula function method allow u adopt work various application flexibly choose appropriate parameter setting compare state-of-the art approach area use gaussian process gp -based dibp work see much flexible term allow two correspond binary matrix column great variation non-zero entry experiment real-world synthetic datasets show three propose model perform well document cluster task compare standard nmf without predefining dimension factor matrix bivariate beta distribution-based copula-based model good flexibility gp-based model
