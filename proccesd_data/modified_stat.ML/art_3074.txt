 complexity learn kernel well-recognized limitation kernel learn requirement handle kernel matrix whose size quadratic number training example many method propose reduce computational cost mostly use subset kernel matrix entry form low-rank matrix approximation random projection method paper study low bound error attainable method function number entry observe kernel matrix rank approximate kernel matrix show kernel learn problem method lead non-trivial computational saving result also quantify problem difficulty depend parameter nature loss function regularization parameter norm desired predictor kernel matrix rank result also suggest case efficient kernel learn might possible
