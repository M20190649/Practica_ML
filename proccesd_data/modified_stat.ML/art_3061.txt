 fast function function regression analyze problem regression input covariates output response function nonparametric function class function function regression ffr cover large range interesting application include time-series prediction problem also general task like study mapping two separate type distribution however previous nonparametric estimator ffr type problem scale badly computationally number input output pair data-set give complexity mapping general function may necessary consider large data-sets order achieve low estimation risk address issue develop novel scalable nonparametric estimator triple-basis estimator capable operating datasets many instance best knowledge first nonparametric ffr estimator scale massive datasets analyze 's risk derive upperbound rate furthermore show improvement several order magnitude term prediction speed reduction error previous estimator various real-world data-sets
