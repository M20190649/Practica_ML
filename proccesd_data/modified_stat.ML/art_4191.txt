 learn feature evolvable stream learn stream data attract much attention past year though study consider data stream fixed feature real practice feature may evolvable example feature data gather limited-lifespan sensor change sensor substitute new one paper propose novel learn paradigm emph feature evolvable stream learn old feature would vanish new feature would occur rather rely current feature attempt recover vanished feature exploit improve performance specifically learn two model recovered feature current feature respectively benefit recovered feature develop two ensemble method first method combine prediction two model theoretically show assistance old feature performance new feature improve second approach dynamically select best single prediction establish good performance guarantee best model switch experiment synthetic real data validate effectiveness proposal
