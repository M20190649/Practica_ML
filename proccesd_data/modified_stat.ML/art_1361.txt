 optimal unrestricted learning procedure study learn problem involve arbitrary class function f distribution x target proper learning procedure i.e. procedure allow select function f tend perform poorly unless problem satisfy additional structural property e.g. f convex consider unrestricted learning procedure free choose function outside give class present new unrestricted procedure optimal strong sense required sample complexity essentially best one hope estimate hold almost problem include heavy-tailed situation moreover sample complexity coincides one would expect f convex even f f convex procedure turn proper thus unrestricted procedure actually optimal realm convex class proper procedure arbitrary class unrestricted procedure
