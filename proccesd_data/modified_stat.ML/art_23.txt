 lle low-dimensional neighborhood representation local linear embed algorithm lle non-linear dimension-reducing technique widely use due computational simplicity intuitive approach lle first linearly reconstruct input point near neighbor preserve neighborhood relation low-dimensional embedding show reconstruction weight compute lle capture high-dimensional structure neighborhood low-dimensional manifold structure consequently weight vector highly sensitive noise moreover cause lle converge linear projection input oppose non-linear embedding goal overcome problem propose compute weight vector use low-dimensional neighborhood representation prove theoretically straightforward computationally simple modification lle reduces lle 's sensitivity noise modification also remove need regularization number neighbor large dimension input present numerical example demonstrate perturbation linear projection problem improve output use low-dimensional neighborhood representation
