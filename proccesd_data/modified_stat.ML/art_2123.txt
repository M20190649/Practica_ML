 statistical linear estimation penalized estimator application reinforcement learn motivate value function estimation reinforcement learning study statistical linear inverse problem i.e. problem coefficient linear system solve observe noise consider penalized estimator performance evaluate use matrix-weighted two-norm defect estimator measure respect true unknown coefficient two objective function consider depend whether error defect measure respect noisy coefficient square unsquared propose simple yet novel theoretically well-founded data-dependent choice regularization parameter case avoid data-splitting distinguishing feature analysis derive deterministic error bound term error coefficient thus allow complete separation analysis stochastic property error show result lead new insight bound linear value function estimation reinforcement learning
