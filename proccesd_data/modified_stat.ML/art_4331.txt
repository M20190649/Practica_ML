 actual actor-critic adversarial learn generative adversarial network gans powerful framework deep generative modeling pose two-player minimax problem gans typically trained end-to-end real-valued data use train generator high-dimensional realistic image however major limitation gans train relies pass gradient discriminator generator via back-propagation make fundamentally difficult train gans discrete data generation case typically involve non-differentiable function difficulty extend reinforcement learn set action space compose discrete decision address issue reframing gan framework generator longer trained use gradient discriminator instead trained use learned critic actor-critic framework temporal difference td objective natural fit sequence modeling use achieve improvement language modeling task standard teacher-forcing method
