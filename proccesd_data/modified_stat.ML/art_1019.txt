 fuzzy clustering distribution-valued data use adaptive l wasserstein distance distributional distribution-valued data new type data arise several source consider realization distributional variable new set fuzzy c-means algorithm data describe distributional variable propose algorithm use l wasserstein distance distribution dissimilarity measure beside extension fuzzy c-means algorithm distributional data consider decomposition squared l wasserstein distance propose set algorithms use different automatic way compute weight associate variable well component globally cluster-wise relevance weight compute clustering process introduce product-to-one constraint relevance weight induce adaptive distance express importance variable component clustering process act also variable selection method cluster test propose algorithm artificial real-world data result confirm propose method able better take account cluster structure data respect standard fuzzy c-means non-adaptive distance
