 unified gradient regularization family adversarial example adversarial example augment data point generate imperceptible perturbation input sample recently draw much attention machine learning data mining community difficult distinguish real example adversarial example could change prediction many best learning model include state-of-the-art deep learning model recent attempt make build robust model take account adversarial example however method either lead performance drop lack mathematical motivation paper propose unified framework build robust machine learn model adversarial example specifically use unified framework develop family gradient regularization method effectively penalize gradient loss function w.r.t input propose framework appeal offer unified view deal adversarial example incorporate another recently-proposed perturbation base approach special case addition present visual effect reveal semantic meaning perturbation thus support regularization method provide another explanation generalizability adversarial example apply technique maxout network conduct series experiment achieve encourage result two benchmark datasets particular attain best accuracy mnist data without data augmentation competitive performance cifar- data
