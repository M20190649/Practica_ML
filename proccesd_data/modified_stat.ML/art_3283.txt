 bayesian cross validation waic predictive prior design regular asymptotic theory prior design one important problem statistic machine learning cross validation cv widely applicable information criterion waic predictive measure bayesian estimation however difficult apply find optimal prior mathematical property prior evaluation unknown region hyperparameters wide examine paper derive new formula theoretical relation among cv waic generalization loss clarify optimal hyperparameter directly find formula three fact clarify predictive prior design firstly cv waic second order asymptotic expansion hence asymptotically equivalent optimizer hyperparameter secondly hyperparameter minimize cv waic make average generalization loss minimize asymptotically random generalization loss lastly use mathematical relation prior variance optimized hyperparameters cv waic make small small computational cost also show optimized hyperparameter dic marginal likelihood minimize average random generalization loss general
