 differentially private database release via kernel mean embeddings lay theoretical foundation new database release mechanisms allow third-parties construct consistent estimator population statistic ensure privacy individual contributing database protect propose framework rest two main idea first release estimate kernel mean embed data generate random variable instead database still allow third-parties construct consistent estimator wide class population statistic second algorithm satisfy definition differential privacy base release kernel mean embed entirely synthetic data point control accuracy metric available reproducing kernel hilbert space describe two instantiation propose framework suitable different scenario prove theoretical result guarantee differential privacy result algorithm consistency estimator construct output
