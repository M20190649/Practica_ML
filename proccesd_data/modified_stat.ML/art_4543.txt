 adaptive online learning propose general framework study adaptive regret bound online learning framework include model selection bound data-dependent bound give data- model-dependent bound ask exist algorithm achieve bound show modification recently introduce sequential complexity measure use answer question provide sufficient condition adaptive rate achieve particular adaptive rate induces set so-called offset complexity measure obtain small upper bound quantity sufficient demonstrate achievability cornerstone analysis technique use one-sided tail inequality bind suprema offset random process framework recovers improve wide variety adaptive bound include quantile bound second-order data-dependent bound small loss bound addition derive new type adaptive bound online linear optimization base spectral norm well new online pac-bayes theorem hold countably infinite set
