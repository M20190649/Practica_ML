 bayesian generalize fused lasso model via neg distribution fuse lasso penalize loss function l norm regression coefficient successive difference encourage sparsity paper propose bayesian generalized fuse lasso model base normal-exponential-gamma neg prior distribution neg prior assume difference successive regression coefficient propose method enable u construct versatile sparse model ordinary fuse lasso use flexible regularization term also propose sparse fuse algorithm produce exact sparse solution simulation study real data analysis show propose method superior performance ordinary fuse lasso
