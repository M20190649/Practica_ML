 realistic risk-mitigating recommendation via inverse classification inverse classification process make meaningful perturbation test point likely desire classification previously address use data single static point time approach yield inflate probability estimate stem implicitly make assumption recommendation implement instantaneously propose use longitudinal data alleviate issue two way first use past outcome probability feature present use past probability tie historical behavior present allow information take account make initial probability estimate subsequently perform inverse classification secondly follow inverse classification application optimized instance unchangeable feature e.g. age update use value next longitudinal time period optimize test instance probability reassess update unchangeable feature manner reflect notion improvements outcome likelihood result follow inverse classification recommendation materialize instantaneously experiment demonstrate realistic estimate probability obtain factor consideration
