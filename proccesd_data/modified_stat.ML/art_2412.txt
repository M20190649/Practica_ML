 sample complexity learn bayesian network recent year increase interest learn bayesian network data one effective method learn network base minimum description length mdl principle previous work show learning procedure asymptotically successful probability one converge target distribution give sufficient number sample however rate convergence hitherto unknown work examine sample complexity mdl base learning procedure bayesian network show number sample need learn epsilon-close approximation term entropy distance confidence delta epsilon log epsilon log delta loglog delta mean sample complexity low-order polynomial error threshold sub-linear confidence bound also discuss constant term depend complexity target distribution finally address question asymptotic minimality propose method use sample complexity result speed learning process
