 model selection approach cluster multinomial sequence non-negative factorization consider problem cluster sequence multinomial observation way model selection criterion propose form penalty term model selection procedure approach subsume conventional aic bic criterion also extend conventional criterion way applicable also sequence sparse multinomial observation even within cluster number multinomial trial may different different observation addition preliminary estimation step maximum likelihood estimation generally maximum l q estimation propose use reduced rank projection combination non-negative factorization motivate approach show model selection criterion preliminary estimation step yield consistent estimate simplify assumption also illustrate approach numerical experiment use real simulate data
