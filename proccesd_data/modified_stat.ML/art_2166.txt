 detection concept change time-varying data stream test exchangeability martingale framework concept change detection base test data exchangeability recently propose ho paper describe propose change-detection test base doob 's maximal inequality show approximation sequential probability ratio test sprt relationship threshold value use propose test size power deduce approximation mean delay time change detect estimate use average sample number sprt performance test use various threshold value examine five different data stream scenario simulate use two synthetic data set finally experimental result show test effective detect change time-varying data stream simulate use three benchmark data set
