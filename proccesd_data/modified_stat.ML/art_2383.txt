 extragradient-based alternating direction method convex minimization paper consider problem minimize sum two convex function subject linear link constraint classical alternating direction type method usually assume two convex function relatively easy proximal mapping however many problem arise statistic image processing field structure one two function easy proximal mapping function smoothly convex easy proximal mapping therefore classical alternating direction method apply deal difficulty propose paper alternating direction method base extragradients assumption smooth function lipschitz continuous gradient prove propose method return epsilon -optimal solution within epsilon iteration apply propose method solve new statistical model call fuse logistic regression numerical experiment show propose method perform well solve test problem also test performance propose method solve lasso problem arise statistic compare result several exist efficient solver problem result encouraging indeed
