 reduction elastic net support vector machine application gpu compute past year witness many dedicate open-source project build maintain implementation support vector machine svm parallelize gpu multi-core cpu distributed system point comparable effort make parallelize elastic net despite popularity many high impact application include genetics neuroscience system biology first contribution paper theoretical nature establish tight link two seemingly different algorithm prove elastic net regression reduce svm squared hinge loss classification second contribution derive practical algorithm base reduction reduction enable u utilize prior effort speed parallelize svms obtain highly optimize parallel solver elastic net lasso simple wrapper consist line matlab code obtain elastic net implementation naturally utilize gpu multi-core cpu demonstrate twelve real world data set algorithm yield identical result popular highly optimized glmnet implementation one several order magnitude faster
