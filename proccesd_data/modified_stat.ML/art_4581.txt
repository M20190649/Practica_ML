 data-driven rank break efficient rank aggregation rank aggregation system collect ordinal preference individual produce global ranking represent social preference rank-breaking common practice reduce computational complexity learn global ranking individual preference break pairwise comparison apply efficient algorithms tailor independent paired comparison however due ignored dependency data naive rank-breaking approach result inconsistent estimate key idea produce accurate consistent estimate treat pairwise comparison unequally depend topology collect data paper provide optimal rank-breaking estimator achieve consistency also achieve best error bound allow u characterize fundamental tradeoff accuracy complexity analysis identify accuracy depend spectral gap corresponding comparison graph
