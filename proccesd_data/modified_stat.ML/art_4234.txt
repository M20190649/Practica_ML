 preserve differential privacy convolutional deep belief network remarkable development deep learning medicine healthcare domain present obvious privacy issue deep neural network build user personal highly sensitive data e.g. clinical record user profile biomedical image etc however scientific study preserve privacy deep learning conduct paper focus develop private convolutional deep belief network pcdbn essentially convolutional deep belief network cdbn differential privacy main idea enforce epsilon-differential privacy leverage functional mechanism perturb energy-based objective function traditional cdbns rather result one key contribution work propose use chebyshev expansion derive approximate polynomial representation objective function theoretical analysis show derive sensitivity error bound approximate polynomial representation result preserve differential privacy cdbns feasible apply model health social network i.e. yesiwell data handwriting digit dataset i.e. mnist data human behavior prediction human behavior classification handwrite digit recognition task theoretical analysis rigorous experimental evaluation show pcdbn highly effective significantly outperform exist solution
