 convergent message-passing algorithm inference general graph convex free energy inference problem graphical model represent constrained optimization free energy function know bethe free energy use fixedpoints belief propagation bp algorithm correspond local minimum free energy however bp fail converge many case interest moreover bethe free energy non-convex graphical model cycle thus introduce great difficulty derive efficient algorithm find local minimum free energy general graph paper introduce two efficient bp-like algorithm one sequential parallel guarantee converge global minimum graph class energy know convex free energy addition propose efficient heuristic set parameter convex free energy base structure graph
