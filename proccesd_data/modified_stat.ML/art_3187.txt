 consistency analysis near subspace classifier near subspace classifier nss find estimation underlying subspace within class assigns data point class correspond near subspace paper mainly study well nss generalize new sample prove n strongly consistent certain assumption completeness n evaluate experiment various simulate real data set comparison linear model base classifier also show n obtain effective classification result efficient especially large scale data set
