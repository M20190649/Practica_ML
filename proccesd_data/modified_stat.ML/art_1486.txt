 scalable prototype selection genetic algorithm hash classification dissimilarity space become active research area since provide possibility learn data give form pairwise non-metric dissimilarity otherwise would difficult cope selection prototype key step creation space however despite previous effort find good prototype select best representation set remain open issue paper propose scalable method select set prototype large datasets method base genetic algorithm dissimilarity-based hashing two different unsupervised supervise scalable criterion unsupervised criterion base minimum spanning tree graph create prototype node dissimilarity edge supervised criterion base count match label object close prototype suitability type algorithm analyze specific case dissimilarity representation experimental result show method select good prototype take advantage large datasets low runtimes
