 variational reformulation bayesian inverse problem classical approach inverse problem base optimization misfit function despite computational appeal approach suffers many shortcoming e.g. non-uniqueness solution model prior knowledge etc bayesian formalism inverse problem avoid difficulty encounter optimization approach albeit increase computational cost work use information theoretic argument cast bayesian inference problem term optimization problem result scheme combine theoretical soundness fully bayesian inference computational efficiency simple optimization
