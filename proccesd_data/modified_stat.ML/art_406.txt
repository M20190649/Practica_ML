 learn conditional independence structure stationary time series multitask learn approach propose method infer conditional independence graph cig high-dimensional gaussian vector time series discrete-time process finite-length observation contrast exist approach rely parametric process model e.g. autoregressive model observed random process instead require certain smoothness property fourier domain process propose inference scheme work even sample size much small number scalar process component true underlying cig sufficiently sparse theoretical performance analysis provide condition guarantee probability propose inference method deliver wrong cig prescribed value condition imply low bound sample size new method consistent asymptotically numerical experiment validate theoretical performance analysis demonstrate superior performance scheme compare exist parametric approach case model mismatch
