 accurate conservative estimate mrf log-likelihood use reverse anneal markov random field mrfs difficult evaluate generative model compute test log-probabilities require intractable partition function anneal importance sample ai widely use estimate mrf partition function often yield quite accurate result however ai prone overestimate log-likelihood little indication anything wrong present reverse ai estimator raise stochastic low bound log-likelihood approximation original mrf model raise require mcmc transition operator standard ai experimental result indicate raise agree closely ais log-probability estimate rbms dbms dbns typically err side underestimating rather overestimate log-likelihood
