 development theory randomized short path comparison graph node distance lately several suggestion parametrized distance graph generalize short path distance commute time resistance distance need develop distance rise observation above-mentioned common distance many situation fail take account global structure graph article develop theory one family graph node distance know randomized short path dissimilarity foundation statistical physic show randomized short path dissimilarity easily compute closed form pair node graph moreover come new definition distance measure call free energy distance free energy distance see upgrade randomized short path dissimilarity define metric addition satisfy graph-geodetic property derivation computation free energy distance also straightforward make comparison set generalized distance interpolate short path distance commute time resistance distance comparison focus applicability distance graph node clustering classification comparison general show parametrized distance perform well task particular see result obtain free energy distance among best experiment
