 convergent expectation propagation linear model spike-and-slab prior exact inference linear regression model spike slab prior often intractable expectation propagation ep use approximate inference however regular sequential form ep r-ep may fail converge model size training set small alternative propose provably convergent ep algorithm pc-ep pc-ep prove minimize energy function constraint bound whose stationary point coincide solution r-ep experiment synthetic data indicate r-ep converge approximation generate pc-ep often well contrast r-ep converges method perform similarly
