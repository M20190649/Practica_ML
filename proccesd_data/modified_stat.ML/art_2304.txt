 sufficient dimensionality reduction irrelevant statistic problem find reduced dimensionality representation categorical variable preserve relevant characteristic fundamental analysis complex data specifically give co-occurrence matrix two variable one often seek compact representation one variable preserve information variable recently introduce sufficient dimensionality reduction gt- method extract continuous reduce dimensional feature whose measurement i.e. expectation value capture maximal mutual information among variable however measurement often capture information irrelevant give task widely know example illumination condition irrelevant feature face recognition write style irrelevant feature content classification intonation irrelevant feature speech recognition irrelevance deduce apriori since depend detail task thus inherently ill define purely unsupervised case separate relevant irrelevant feature achieve use additional side data contains irrelevant structure approach take ct- extend information bottleneck method use cluster compress data use side-information framework identify feature whose measurement maximally informative original data set carry little information possible side data set statistical term understand extract statistic maximally sufficient original dataset simultaneously maximally ancillary side dataset formulate tradeoff constrained optimization problem characterize solution derive gradient descent algorithm problem base generalized iterative scaling method find maximum entropy distribution method demonstrate synthetic data well real face recognition datasets show outperform standard method oriented pca
