 find large mean among many sample distribution find one large mean arises broad range application mathematically model multi-armed bandit problem distribution associate arm paper study sample complexity identify best arm large mean multi-armed bandit problem motivate large-scale application especially interested identify situation total number sample necessary sufficient find best arm scale linearly number arm present single-parameter multi-armed bandit model span range linear superlinear sample complexity also give new algorithm best arm identification call prism linear sample complexity wide range mean distribution algorithm like exploration procedure multi-armed bandit adaptive sense next arm sample select base previous sample compare sample complexity adaptive procedure simple non-adaptive procedure use new low bound many problem instance increase sample complexity require non-adaptive procedure polynomial factor number arm
