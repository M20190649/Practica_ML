 distance-based branch bound feature selection algorithm known efficient method select k gaussian feature n achieve low bayesian classification error show example greedy algorithm face task lead give result optimal motivate u propose robust approach present branch bound algorithm find subset k independent gaussian feature minimize naive bayesian classification error algorithm us additive monotonic distance measure produce bound bayesian classification error order exclude many feature subset evaluation still return optimal solution test method synthetic data well data obtain gene expression profiling
