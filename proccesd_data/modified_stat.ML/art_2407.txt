 information-theoretic analysis hard soft assignment method cluster assignment method heart many algorithm unsupervised learning cluster particular well-known k-means expectation-maximization em algorithm work study several different method assignment include hard assignment use k-means soft assignment use em know k-means minimize distortion data em maximize likelihood little know systematic difference behavior two algorithm shed light difference via information-theoretic analysis cornerstone result simple decomposition expected distortion show k-means extension infer general parametric density unlabeled sample data must implicitly manage trade-off similar data assign cluster data balance among cluster well data balance measure entropy partition define hard assignment addition let u predict verify systematic difference k-means em specific example decomposition allow u give rather general argument show k mean consistently find density less overlap em also study third natural assignment method call posterior assignment close spirit soft assignment em lead surprisingly different algorithm
