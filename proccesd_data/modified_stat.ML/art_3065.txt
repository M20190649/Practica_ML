 solution multi-alignment transformation synchronisation alignment set object mean transformation play important role computer vision whilst case two object solve globally multiple object consider usually iterative method use practice iterative method perform well relative transformation pair object free noise however noisy relative transformation available e.g due miss data wrong correspondence iterative method may fail base observation underlie noise-free transformation retrieve null space matrix directly obtain pairwise alignment paper present novel method synchronisation pairwise transformation transitively consistent simulation demonstrate noisy transformation large proportion miss data even wrong correspondence assignment method delivers encouraging result
