 path integral control reproduce kernel hilbert space embed present embedding stochastic optimal control problem called path integral form reproduce kernel hilbert space use consistent sample base estimate embed lead model free non-parametric approach calculation approximate solution control problem formulation admit decomposition problem invariant task dependent component consequently make much efficient use sample data compare previous sample base approach domain e.g. allow sample re-use across task numerical example test problem illustrate sample efficiency provide
