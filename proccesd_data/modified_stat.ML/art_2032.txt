 model local global phenomenon sparse gaussian process much recent work concern sparse approximation speed gaussian process regression unfavorable n scaling computational time nm thus far work concentrate model one covariance function however many practical situation additive model multiple covariance function may perform good since data may contain long short length-scale phenomenon long length-scales capture global sparse approximation fully independent conditional fic short length-scales model naturally covariance function compact support c c covariance function lead naturally sparse covariance matrix computationally cheap handle full covariance matrix paper propose new sparse gaussian process model two additive component fic long length-scales cs covariance function short length-scales give theoretical experimental result show certain condition propose model computational complexity fic also compare model performance propose model additive model approximate fully partially independent conditional pic use real data set show model outperform fic pic approximation data set two additive phenomenon
