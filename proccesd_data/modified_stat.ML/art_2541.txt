 correlate random feature fast semi-supervised learning paper present correlate nystrom view xnv fast semi-supervised algorithm regression classification algorithm draw two main idea first generate two view consist computationally inexpensive random feature second xnv applies multiview regression use canonical correlation analysis cca unlabeled data bias regression towards useful feature show view contain accurate estimator cca regression substantially reduce variance minimal increase bias random view justify recent theoretical empirical work show regression random feature closely approximate kernel regression imply random view expect contain accurate estimator show xnv consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithm semi-supervised learning substantially improve predictive performance reduce variability performance wide variety real-world datasets whilst also reduce runtime order magnitude
