 high-dimensional covariance decomposition sparse markov independence domain paper present novel framework incorporate combination sparse model different domain posit observed data generate linear combination sparse gaussian markov model sparse precision matrix sparse gaussian independence model sparse covariance matrix provide efficient method decomposition data two domain viz markov independence domain characterize set sufficient condition identifiability model consistency decomposition method base simple modification popular ell -penalized maximum-likelihood estimator ell -mle establish estimator consistent domain i.e. successfully recover support markov independence model number sample n scale n omega log p p number variable maximum node degree markov model condition recovery comparable ell -mle consistent estimation sparse markov model thus guarantee successful high-dimensional estimation rich class model comparable condition experiment validate result also demonstrate model good inference accuracy simple algorithm loopy belief propagation
