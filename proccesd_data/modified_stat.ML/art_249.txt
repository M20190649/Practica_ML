 jitter-adaptive dictionary learn application multi-trial neuroelectric signal dictionary learning prove powerful tool many image processing task atom typically define small image patch drawback dictionary encode basic structure addition approach treat patch different location one single set mean loss information feature well-aligned across signal case instance multi-trial magneto- electroencephalography eeg learn dictionary entire signal could make use alignement reveal higher-level feature case however small missalignements phase variation feature would compensate paper propose extension common dictionary learning framework overcome limitation allow atom adapt position across signal method validate simulated real neuroelectric data
