 formula count size markov equivalence class direct acyclic graph size markov equivalence class direct acyclic graph play important role measure uncertainty complexity causal learning markov equivalence class represent essential graph undirected subgraphs determine size class paper develop method derive formula count size markov equivalence class first introduce new concept core graph size markov equivalence class interest polynomial number vertex give core graph discuss recursive explicit formula polynomial provide algorithm derive size formula via symbolic computation give core graph propose size formula derivation shed light relationship size markov equivalence class representation graph make size count efficient even essential graph contain non-sparse undirected subgraphs
