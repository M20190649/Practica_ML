 brainstorming consensus learning practice present introduction brainstorm approach recently propose consensus meta-learning technique use several practical application bioinformatics chemoinformatics consensus learn denotes heterogeneous theoretical classification method one train ensemble machine learn algorithms use different type input train data representation second step solution gather consensus build therefore early solution give even generally low perform algorithm discarder late phase prediction final conclusion draw compare different machine learning model final phase i.e consensus learning try balance generality solution overall performance trained model
