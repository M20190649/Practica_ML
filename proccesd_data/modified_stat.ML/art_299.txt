 thompson sample -dimensional exponential family bandit thompson sampling demonstrate many complex bandit model however theoretical guarantee available parametric multi-armed bandit still limit bernoulli case extend prove asymptotic optimality algorithm use jeffreys prior -dimensional exponential family bandit proof build previous work also make extensive use closed form kullback-leibler divergence fisher information thus jeffreys prior available exponential family allow u give finite time exponential concentration inequality posterior distribution exponential family may interest right moreover analysis cover distribution optimistic algorithm yet propose include heavy-tailed exponential family
