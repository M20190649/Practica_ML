 learn sparse data exploit monotonicity constraint train data sparse domain knowledge must incorporate learn algorithm order reduce effective size hypothesis space paper build previous work knowledge qualitative monotonicities formally represent incorporate learn algorithms e.g. clark matwin 's work cn rule learn algorithm show interpret knowledge qualitative influence particular monotonicities constraint probability distribution incorporate knowledge bayesian network learn algorithm show yield improve accuracy particularly small train set e.g less example
