 study fixed point spurious solution fastica algorithm fastica algorithm one popular iterative algorithm domain linear independent component analysis despite success observe fastica occasionally yield outcome correspond true solution know demixing vector ica problem outcome commonly refer spurious solution although fastica among extensively study ica algorithm occurrence spurious solution yet completely understood community contribution aim address issue first part work interested relationship demixing vector local optimizers contrast function attractive unattractive fixed point fastica algorithm characterization set give inclusion relationship discover second part investigate possible scenario spurious solution occur show certain bimodal gaussian mixture distribution involve may exist spurious solution attractive fixed point fastica case popular nonlinearities gauss tanh tend yield spurious solution whereas kurtosis may give reliable result advice give practical choice nonlinearity function
