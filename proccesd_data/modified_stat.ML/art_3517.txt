 fuzzy jet collimate stream particle produce high energy physic experiment organize use cluster algorithm form jet construct jet experimental collaboration base large hadron collider lhc primarily use agglomerative hierarchical clustering scheme know sequential recombination propose new class algorithm cluster jet use infrared collinear safe mixture model new algorithm know fuzzy jet cluster use maximum likelihood technique dynamically determine various property jet like size show fuzzy jet size add additional information conventional jet tag variable furthermore study impact pileup show slight modification algorithm fuzzy jet stable high pileup interaction multiplicity
