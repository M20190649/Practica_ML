 feature extraction automated classification heartbeat machine learning present algorithms detection class heart arrhythmia goal eventual adoption practice cardiologist clinical practice detection base small number meaningful feature extract heartbeat cycle however technique propose literature use high dimensional vector consist morphological time base feature detection use electrocardiogram ecg signal find small subset feature sufficient detect arrhythmia high accuracy feature find iterative step-wise feature selection method depart common literature following aspect oppose high dimensional feature vector use small set feature meaningful clinical interpretation eliminate necessity short-duration patient-specific ecg data append global training data classification apply semi-parametric classification procedure ensemble framework arrhythmia detection approach base reduced sampling rate hz oppose hz standard literature
