 hybridization expectation-maximization k-means algorithm good clustering performance present work propose hybridization expectation-maximization em k-means technique attempt speed-up clustering process though k-means em technique look different area k-means view approximate way obtain maximum likelihood estimate mean along propose algorithm hybridization present work also experiment standard em algorithm six different datasets use experiment three synthetic datasets cluster fitness sum squared error sse compute measure clustering performance experiment observe propose algorithm hybridization em k-means technique consistently take less execution time acceptable cluster fitness value less sse standard em algorithm also observe propose algorithm produce well cluster result cluster package purdue university
