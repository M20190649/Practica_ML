 mutual contamination analysis mixed membership partial label model many machine learn problem characterize mutual contamination model problem one observe several random sample different convex combination set unknown base distribution interest decontaminate mutual contamination model i.e. recover base distribution either exactly permutation paper consider general setting base distribution define arbitrary probability space examine decontamination problem two mutual contamination model describe popular machine learn task recover base distributions permutation mixed membership model recover base distribution exactly partial label model classification give necessary sufficient condition identifiability mutual contamination model algorithm problem infinite finite sample case introduce novel proof technique base affine geometry
