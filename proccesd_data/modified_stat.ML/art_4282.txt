 interpretable feature recommendation signal analytics paper present automated approach interpretable feature recommendation solve signal data analytics problem method test perform experiment datasets domain prognostic interpretation feature consider important propose approach base wide learning architecture provide mean interpretation recommended feature note interpretation available feature learn approach like deep learning convolutional neural network feature transformation approach like principal component analysis result show feature recommendation interpretation technique quite effective problem hand term performance drastic reduction time develop solution show example human-in-loop interpretation system use prescriptive system
