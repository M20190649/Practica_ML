 closed-form approach bayesian inference tree-structured graphical model consider inference structure undirected graphical model exact bayesian framework specifically aim achieve inference close-form posterior avoid sampling step task would intractable without restriction consider graph limit exploration mixture span tree consider inference structure undirected graphical model bayesian framework avoid convergence issue highly demand monte carlo sampling focus exact inference specifically aim achieve inference close-form posterior avoid sampling step aim restrict set consider graph mixture span tree investigate condition prior tree structure parameter exact bayesian inference achieve condition derive fast exact algorithm compute posterior probability edge belong tree model use algebraic result call matrix-tree theorem show assumption make prevent approach perform well synthetic flow cytometry data
