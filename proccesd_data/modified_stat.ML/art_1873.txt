 active semi-supervised learning use submodular function consider active semi-supervised learning offline transductive setting show previously propose error bound active learning undirected weighted graph generalize replace graph cut arbitrary symmetric submodular function arbitrary non-symmetric submodular function use via symmetrization different choice submodular function give different version error bound appropriate different kind problem moreover bound deterministic hold adversarially choose label show exactly minimize error bound np-complete however also introduce submodular function associate active semi-supervised learning method approximately minimize corresponding error bound show error bound tight sense bound form well theoretical result support experiment real data
