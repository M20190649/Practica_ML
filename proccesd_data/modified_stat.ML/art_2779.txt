 learn order representation nested dropout paper study ordered representation data different dimension different degree importance learn representation introduce nest dropout procedure stochastically remove coherent nested set hidden unit neural network first present sequence theoretical result simple case semi-linear autoencoder rigorously show application nest dropout enforces identifiability unit lead exact equivalence pca extend algorithm deep model demonstrate relevance ordered representation number application specifically use ordered property learned code construct hash-based data structure permit fast retrieval achieve retrieval time logarithmic database size independent dimensionality representation allow code hundred time long currently feasible retrieval therefore avoid diminished quality associate short code still perform retrieval competitive speed exist method also show ordered representation promising way learn adaptive compression efficient online data reconstruction
