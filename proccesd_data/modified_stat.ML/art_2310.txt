 learn continuous time bayesian network continuous time bayesian network ctbns describe structure stochastic process finitely many state evolve continuous time ctbn directed possibly cyclic dependency graph set variable represent finite state continuous time markov process whose transition model function parent address problem learn parameter structure ctbn fully observe data define conjugate prior ctbns show use bayesian parameter estimation basis bayesian score structure learning acyclicity constraint ctbns show structure learning problem significantly easy theory practice structure learn dynamic bayesian network dbns furthermore ctbns tailor parameter dependency structure different time granularity evolution different variable provide good fit continuous-time process dbns fixed time granularity
