 small sample inference generalization error classification use cud bound confidence measure generalization error crucial small training sample use construct classifier common approach estimate generalization error resampling assume resampled estimator follow known distribution form confidence set kohavi martin yang alternatively one might bootstrap resampled estimator generalization error form confidence set unfortunately method reliably provide set desired confidence poor performance appear due lack smoothness generalization error function learn classifier result non-normal distribution estimate generalization error construct confidence set generalization error use smooth upper bound deviation resampled estimate generalization error confidence set form bootstrapping upper bound case approximation class classifier represent parametric additive model provide computationally efficient algorithm method exhibit superior performance across series test simulate data set
