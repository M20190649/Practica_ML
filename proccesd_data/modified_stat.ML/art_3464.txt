 correlated random measure develop correlated random measure random measure atom weight exhibit flexible pattern dependence use develop powerful hierarchical bayesian nonparametric model hierarchical bayesian nonparametric model usually build completely random measure poisson-process base construction atom weight independent completely random measure imply strong independence assumption corresponding hierarchical model assumption often misplace real-world setting correlated random measure address limitation model correlation within measure use gaussian process concert poisson process correlated random measure example develop latent feature model infer property latent feature dependency pattern develop several example well study correlated random measure model pairwise count data derive efficient variational inference algorithm show improved predictive performance large data set document web click electronic health record
