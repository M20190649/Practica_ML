 structured uncertainty prediction network paper first work propose network predict structured uncertainty distribution synthesized image previous approach mostly limit predict diagonal covariance matrix novel model learn predict full gaussian covariance matrix reconstruction permit efficient sample likelihood evaluation demonstrate model accurately reconstruct ground truth correlate residual distribution synthetic datasets generate plausible high frequency sample real face image also illustrate use predict covariance structure preserve image denoising
