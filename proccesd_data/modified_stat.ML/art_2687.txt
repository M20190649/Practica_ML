 fundamental limit online distribute algorithm statistical learning estimation many machine learning approach characterize information constraint interact training data include memory sequential access constraint e.g fast first-order method solve stochastic optimization problem communication constraint e.g distribute learning partial access underlie data e.g miss feature multi-armed bandit however currently little understanding information constraint fundamentally affect performance independent learning problem semantics example learn problem algorithm small memory footprint use bounded number bit example certain communication constraint perform bad possible without constraint paper describe single set result implies positive answer several different setting
