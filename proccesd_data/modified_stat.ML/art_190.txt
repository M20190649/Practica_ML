 general framework dual certificate analysis structured sparse recovery problem paper develop general theoretical framework analyze structured sparse recovery problem use notation dual certificate although certain aspect dual certificate idea already use previous work due lack general coherent theory analysis far carry limited scope specific problem context current paper make two contribution first introduce general definition dual certificate use develop unified theory sparse recovery analysis convex programming second present class structured sparsity regularization call structure lasso calculation readily perform theoretical framework new theory include many seemingly loosely related previous work special case also imply new result improve exist one even standard formulation l regularization
