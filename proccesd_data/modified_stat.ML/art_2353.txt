 domain generalization via invariant feature representation paper investigate domain generalization take knowledge acquire arbitrary number related domain apply previously unseen domain propose domain-invariant component analysis dica kernel-based optimization algorithm learn invariant transformation minimize dissimilarity across domain whilst preserve functional relationship input output variable learning-theoretic analysis show reduce dissimilarity improve expected generalization ability classifier new domain motivate propose algorithm experimental result synthetic real-world datasets demonstrate dica successfully learn invariant feature improves classifier performance practice
