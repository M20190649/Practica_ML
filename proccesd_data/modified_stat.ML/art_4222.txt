 matrix hilbert space application matrix learn theoretical study prove hilbert space remarkable performance many field application frame tensor product hilbert space introduce generalize inner product high-order tensor however technique require tensor decomposition could lead loss information np-hard problem determine rank tensor present new framework namely matrix hilbert space perform matrix inner product space data observation represent matrix preserve structure initial data multi-way correlation among capture process addition extend reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs reproduce kernel matrix hilbert space rkmhs propose equivalent condition space use certain kernel function new family kernel introduce framework apply classifier support tensor machine stm comparative experiment perform number real-world datasets support contribution
