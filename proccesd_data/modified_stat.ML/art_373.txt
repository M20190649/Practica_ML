 survey estimation mutual information method measure dependency versus correlation analysis survey present compare different approach estimate mutual information mi data analyse general dependency variable interest system demonstrate performance difference mi versus correlation analysis optimal case linear dependency first use piece-wise constant bayesian methodology use general dirichlet prior estimation method use two-stage approach approximate probability distribution first calculate marginal joint entropy demonstrate performance bayesian approach versus others compute dependency different variable also compare linear correlation analysis finally apply mi correlation analysis identification bias determination aerosol optical depth aod satellite base moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis ground base aerosol robotic network aeronet observe aod measurement two instrument might different location reason bias explore quantify dependency bias variable include cloud cover surface reflectivity others
