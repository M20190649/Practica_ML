 metric learn perspective svm relation svm lmnn support vector machine svms large margin near neighbor algorithm lmnn two popular learn algorithm quite different learning bias paper bring unified view show much strong relation commonly think analyze svms metric learning perspective cast metric learning problem view help u uncover relation two algorithm show lmnn see learn set local svm-like model quadratic space along way inspire metric-based interpretation svm derive novel variant svms epsilon-svm lmnn even similar give unified view lmnn different svm variant finally provide preliminary experiment number benchmark datasets show epsilon-svm compare favorably respect lmnn svm
