 gaussian process limit linear model gaussian process retain linear model either special case limit show relationship exploit data least partially linear however perspective bayesian posterior gaussian process encode linear model either probability nearly zero otherwise unattainable without explicit construction prior limit linear model mind develop prior show practical benefit extend well beyond computational conceptual simplicity linear model example linearity extract per-dimension basis combine treed partition model yield highly efficient nonstationary model approach demonstrate synthetic real datasets vary linearity dimensionality
