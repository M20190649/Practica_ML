 relaxed oracle semi-supervised cluster pairwise same-cluster query one widely use form supervision semi-supervised clustering however impractical ask human oracle answer every query correctly paper study influence allow not-sure answer weak oracle propose effective algorithm handle uncertainty query response two realistic weak oracle model consider ambiguity answer depends distance two point show small query complexity adequate effective clustering high probability provide good pair weak oracle experimental result synthetic real data show effectiveness approach overcome supervision uncertainty yield high quality cluster
