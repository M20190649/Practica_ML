 complex support vector machine regression quaternary classification paper present new framework complex support vector regression well support vector machine quaternary classification method exploit notion widely linear estimation model input-out relation complex-valued data considers two case complex data split real imaginary part typical real kernel employ map complex data complexified feature space b pure complex kernel use directly map data induce complex feature space recently develop wirtinger 's calculus complex reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhs employ order compute lagrangian derive dual optimization problem one major result prove complex svm svr task equivalent solve two real svm svr task exploit specific real kernel generate chosen complex kernel particular case pure complex kernel lead generation new kernel consider classification case propose framework inherently split complex space four part lead naturally solve four class-task quaternary classification instead typical two class real svm turn rationale use multiclass problem split-class scenario base four class oppose one-versus-all method lead significant computational saving experiment demonstrate effectiveness propose framework regression classification task involve complex data
