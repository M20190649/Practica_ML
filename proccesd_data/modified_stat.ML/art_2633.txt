 joint bayesian estimation close subspace noisy measurement letter consider two set observation define subspace signal embed noise wish analyze distance two subspace latter entail evaluate angle subspace issue reminiscent well-known procrustes problem bayesian approach investigate subspace interest consider random joint prior distribution namely bingham distribution allow closeness two subspace adjust within framework minimum mean-square distance estimator subspace formulate implement via gibbs sampler simpler scheme base alternative maximum posteriori estimation also present new scheme show provide accurate estimate angle subspace compare singular value decomposition base independent estimation two subspace
