 greedy flexible algorithm learn optimal bayesian network structure report paper first present report advanced machine learn course project provide data set present novel heuristic algorithm exact bayesian network bn structure discovery use decomposable score function algorithm follow different approach solve problem bn structure discovery previously use method dynamic programming dp branch bound reduce search space find global optimum space problem algorithm propose degree flexibility make less greedy algorithm set greedy speed algorithm less optimal final structure algorithm run much less time previously know method guarantee optimality close therefore sacrifice less one percent score optimal structure order gain much low running time make algorithm feasible large data set may note never use toolbox except result validation
