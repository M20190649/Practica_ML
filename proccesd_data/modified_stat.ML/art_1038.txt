 convergence guarantee kernel-based quadrature rule misspecified setting kernel-based quadrature rule become important machine learning statistic achieve super- sqrt n convergence rate numerical integration thus provide alternative monte carlo integration challenge setting integrands expensive evaluate integrands high dimensional rule base assumption integrand certain degree smoothness express integrand belong certain reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs however assumption violate practice e.g. integrand black box function general theory establish convergence kernel quadrature misspecified setting contribution prove kernel quadrature consistent even integrand belong assumed rkhs i.e. integrand less smooth assume specifically derive convergence rate depend unknown less smoothness integrand degree smoothness express via power rkhss via sobolev space
