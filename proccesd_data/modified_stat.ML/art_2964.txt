 lovasz-bregman divergence connection rank aggregation clustering web ranking extend recently introduce theory lovasz-bregman lb divergence iyer bilmes several way show represent distortion score ordering thus provide new view rank aggregation order base cluster interesting connection web ranking show lb divergence number property akin many permutation base metric fact special case form similar kendall-tau metric also show lb divergences subsume number commonly use ranking measure information retrieval like ndcg auc unlike traditional permutation base metric however lb divergence naturally capture notion confidence ordering thus provide new representation application involve aggregate score oppose ordering show number recently use web rank model form lovasz-bregman rank aggregation also observe natural form mallow 's model use lb divergence use conditional ranking model learning rank problem
