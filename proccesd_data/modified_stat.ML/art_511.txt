 approximate subspace-sparse recovery corrupt data via constrain ell -minimization high-dimensional data often lie low-dimensional subspace correspond different class belong find sparse representation data point dictionary built use collection data help uncover low-dimensional subspace address problem clustering classification subset selection paper address problem recover sparse representation noisy data point dictionary whose columns correspond corrupt data lie close union subspace consider constrain ell -minimization study condition solution propose optimization satisfy approximate subspace-sparse recovery condition specifically show noisy data point perturb subspace noise magnitude varepsilon reconstruct use data point subspace small error order varepsilon coefficient correspond data point subspace sufficiently small ie order varepsilon impose randomness assumption arrangement subspace distribution data point subspace framework base novel generalization null-space property setting data lie multiple subspace number data point subspace exceed dimension subspace data point corrupt noise moreover assume random distribution data point show coefficient desired support reconstruct give point high accuracy also sufficiently large value ie order
