 incorporation stochastic chemistry dust grain pdr code use moment equation unlike gas-phase reaction chemical reaction take place interstellar dust grain surface always model rate equation due small grain size low flux reaction may exhibit large fluctuation thus require stochastic method moment equation evaluate formation rate h hd molecule dust grain surface abundance gas phase interstellar condition incorporate moment equation meudon pdr code compare result obtain rate equation find within experimental constraint energy barrier diffusion desorption density adsorption site grain surface h hd molecule form efficiently dust grain broad range condition moment equation result coincide obtain rate equation however range relatively high grain temperature significant deviation range rate equation fail moment equation provide accurate result incorporation moment equation pdr code extend reaction take place grain surface
