 akari near-infrared spectroscopy aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbon emission feature galactic superwind aim investigate property hydrocarbon grain galactic superwind method akari perform near-infrared um spectroscopic observation region include northern southern halo result many spectrum show strong emission um due polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pahs relatively weak feature um due aliphatic hydrocarbon particular clearly detect pah um emission um feature halo region locate distance kpc away galactic center find ratio um feature um feature intensity significantly increase distance galactic center ratio um feature akari um band intensity conclusion result clearly confirm presence small pahs even harsh environment halo result also reveal aliphatic hydrocarbon emit um feature unusually abundant halo suggest small carbonaceous grain produce shatter large grain galactic superwind
