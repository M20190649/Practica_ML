 alma view g cloud-cloud collision form cloud present result sulfur monoxide line emission observation g atacama large millimeter submillimeter array alma angular resolution arcsec dense massive molecular cloud g highly sub-structured yet show obvious sign cluster formation find three outstanding feature cloud emission namely shell structure radius pc large velocity gradient km pc cloud core large velocity dispersion km around shell structure suggest large-velocity dispersion core form high-mass star future attempt explore formation scenario dense cloud compare result numerical simulation thus propose g may form due cloud-cloud collision process
