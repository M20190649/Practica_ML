 galaxy shear estimation stack image statistic weak lensing galaxy use constrain cosmology galaxy shear estimate accurately general require accurate modelling unlensed galaxy shape point spread function psf discuss suboptimal potentially robust method estimate galaxy shear stack image stacked image distribution closely gaussian central limit theorem shear determine radial fitting require accurate model psf rather also need model galaxy accurately noise significant asymmetric error centroid must correct method may ultimately able give accurate un-biased result high galaxy density constant shear provide useful baseline optimal method test-case estimate bias though method directly applicable realistic data test stack method simple toy simulation constant psf shear provide great project exist method perform significantly poorly briefly discus generalization realistic case appendix discuss simple analytic galaxy population model stack give optimal error perfect ideal case
