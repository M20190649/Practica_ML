 search mass segregation star brown dwarf ophiuchi apply two different algorithm search mass segregation recent observational census rho ophiuchi star form region firstly apply lambda msr method compare minimum spanning tree mst chosen subset star mst random subset star cluster determine mass segregation ratio lambda msr secondly apply m-sigma method calculate local stellar surface density around star determine statistical significance average surface density chosen mass bin compare average surface density whole cluster use method find indication mass segregation normal inverse spatial distribution star brown dwarf rho ophiuchi although rho ophiuchi suffers high visual extinction show significant mass segregation signature would detectable albeit slightly dilute despite dust obscuration centrally locate massive star
