 gravitational collapse filament formation comparison pipe nebula recent model molecular cloud formation evolution suggest cloud dynamic generally exhibit gravitational collapse present simple analytic model global collapse onto filament compare numerical simulation flow-driven formation isolated molecular cloud illustrate supersonic motion infall ram pressure expect model gravity-driven cloud evolution apply result observation pipe nebula especially suitable object purpose low star formation activity implies insignifcant perturbation stellar feedback show collapse cloud model explain magnitude velocity dispersion see co filamentary structure onishi et al ram pressure require lada et al confine lower-mass core pipe nebula conjecture higher-resolution simulation show small velocity dispersion dense core gas observe infall motion support turbulence result point inevitability ram pressure boundary condition molecular cloud filament possibility especially lower-mass core still accrete mass significant rate suggest observation
