 markov-chain monte-carlo bayesian approach statistical mechanic since middle 's scientist use monte carlo mc simulation obtain information physical process prove accurate reliable method obtain information resent year researcher begone use slightly new markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation differs ordinary mc use markov chain mcmc originates bayesian statistic method give researcher completely new tool learn something physical system one field mcmc good new tool astrophysics today mcmc widely use simulate power spectrum asteroseismic data hereby provide scientist important new information stellar interior result see mcmc delivers robust reliable result good error estimation also learn mcmc power full tool apply large verity problem
