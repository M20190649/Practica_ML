 curious conundrum regard sulfur abundance planetary nebula sulfur abundance derive optical emission line measurement ionization correction factor planetary nebula systematically low expect object metallicities carefully consider large range explanation sulfur anomaly include correlation size sulfur deficit numerous nebular central star property ionization correction factor under-correct unobserved ion effect dielectronic recombination sulfur ionization balance sequestering dust molecule excessive destruction production agb star appear second scenario rule however find evidence sulfur deficit generally reduce eliminate abundance determine directly ir measurement use place customary sulfur ionization correction factor tentatively conclude sulfur anomaly cause inability commonly use icfs properly correct population ionization stage high
