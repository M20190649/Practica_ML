 interpretation infrared vibration-rotation spectrum interstellar circumstellar molecule infrared vibration-rotation line valuable probe interstellar circumstellar molecule especially symmetric molecule pure rotational transition observation interpret isothermal absorbing slab model leave important radiative transfer molecular excitation effect realistic non-lte non-isothermal radiative transfer model construct result model much good agreement observation include case line one branch vibration-rotation band absorption another emission general conclusion base isothermal absorbing slab model misleading assumption lte may lead large error particularly radiation field temperature close gas temperature
