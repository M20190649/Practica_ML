 double single recycled pulsar evolutionary puzzle investigate statistic isolated recycled pulsar double neutron star binary galactic disk since recycle pulsar believe form accretion spinup close binary isolated object presumably originate disrupt progenitor double neutron star comparable number double neutron star system compare isolate recycled pulsar find standard evolutionary model explain fact predict several time number isolated recycle pulsar double neutron star system demonstrate population synthesis calculation velocity distribution isolated recycled pulsar broad binary system account model radio pulsar survey selection effect include effect doppler smearing double neutron star binary find small bias towards detection double neutron star system bias however significant enough explain observational discrepancy standard sigma km neutron star natal kick velocity invoke binary population synthesis population synthesis maxwellian velocity dispersion natal kick sigma km consistent observation conclusion support earlier finding neutron star form close interacting binary receive significantly small natal kick velocity galactic single pulsar would seem indicate
