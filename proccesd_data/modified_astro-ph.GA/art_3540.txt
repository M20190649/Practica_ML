 galactic magnetic field letter complete model galactic magnetic field gmf use wmap ghz total synchrotron intensity map early result obtain -parameter model galactic random field determine strength striated random field combination -parameter description regular gmf obtain good fit forty thousand extragalactic faraday rotation measure rms wmap ghz polarize total intensity synchrotron emission map data call striated component random field whose orientation align regular field zero mean rms strength large regular field noteworthy feature new model regular field significant out-of-plane component consider earlier new gmf model give much good description totality data previous model literature
