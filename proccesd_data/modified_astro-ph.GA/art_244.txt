 high-velocity cloud form thermal instability examine proposal hi high-velocity cloud hvcs surround milky way disc galaxy form condensation hot galactic corona via thermal instability assumption galactic corona well represent non-rotating stratify atmosphere find formation mechanism work corona must almost perfectly flat entropy profile case growth thermal perturbation suppress combination buoyancy thermal conduction even entropy profile nearly flat cold cloud size small kpc could form corona milky way radius large kpc contradiction determined distance large hvc complex cloud size kpc form inner halo low-mass system conclude unless even slow rotation qualitatively change dynamic corona thermal instability unlikely viable mechanism formation cold cloud around disc galaxy
