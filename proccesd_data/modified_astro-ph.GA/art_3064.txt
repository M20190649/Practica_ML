 tidal tail tucanae galactic globular cluster tucanae tuc show rare increase velocity dispersion profile large radius indicative energetic yet bind star large radius dominate velocity dispersion potentially ongoing evaporation escape star form tidal tail see several galactic globular cluster however tidal tail tuc yet uncover model tail tuc use accurate input data available specific aim determine location well density epicyclic overdensities within tail overdensities model show increase galactic background therefore easily detectable use matched filter technique find influential parameter regard location density epicyclic overdensities heliocentric distance cluster hence uncover tidal feature observationally contribute greatly ongoing problem determine distance tuc tightly constrain distance cluster independent method use streakline method determine location tidal tail overdensities show principle shape extent tidal tail galactic globular cluster determine without resort computationally expensive n-body simulation
