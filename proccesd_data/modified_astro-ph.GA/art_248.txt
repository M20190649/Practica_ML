 know millisecond pulsar help detection intermediate-mass black hole center globular cluster consider possibility detect intermediate-mass odot black hole whose existence center globular cluster expect optical infrared observation use precise pulse arrival timing millisecond pulsar globular cluster know date pulsar closest cluster center calculate expect delay time pulse pass gravitational field central black hole detection time delay currently available instrument known pulsar show impossible black hole mass odot problematic black hole mass odot addition signal delay negligible effect pulsar period first derivative compare current accuracy measurement
