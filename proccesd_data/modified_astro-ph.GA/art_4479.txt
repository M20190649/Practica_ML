 model cuspy triaxial stellar system iii effect velocity anisotropy chaoticity several previous investigation present model triaxial stellar system cuspy non cuspy highly stable harboured large fraction chaotic orbit model obtain cold collapse initially spherical n -- body system method necessarily result model strongly radial velocity distribution investigate different method report yield cuspy triaxial model virtually chaos show result probably due use inadequate chaos detection technique fact model significant fraction chaotic orbit result also method besides start one model first paper series obtain three different model render velocity distribution much less radially bias i.e. isotropic modify axial ratio adiabatic compression three model yield much high fraction regular orbit previous work conclude possible obtain stable cuspy triaxial model stellar system whose velocity distribution isotropic model obtain cold collapse model still harbour large fraction chaotic orbit although difficult compare result different model tentatively conclude chaoticity reduce velocity isotropy
