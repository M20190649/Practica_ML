 evolution excitation condition outflow high-mass star-forming region theoretical model suggest massive star form via disk-mediated accretion bipolar outflow play fundamental role recent study toward massive molecular outflow reveal decrease sio line intensity object evolves present study aim characterize variation molecular outflow property time study sio excitation condition outflow associate massive ysos use iram telescope map massive star-forming region sio sio hco outflow line several dense gas hot core tracer hi-gal data use improve spectral energy distribution l ratio believe good indicator evolutionary stage yso detect sio hco outflow emission source bipolar structure six outflow parameter similar find toward massive ysos find increase hco outflow energetics object evolve decrease sio abundance time sio line ratio find low ambient gas velocity increase move high velocity indicate excitation condition sio change velocity gas large density temperature high-velocity gas component property sio hco outflow emission suggest scenario sio largely enhance first evolutionary stage probably due strong shock produce protostellar jet object evolve power jet would decrease sio abundance process however material surround protostar would sweep jet outflow activity trace entrained molecular material hco would increase time
