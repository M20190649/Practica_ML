 impact stellar collision galactic center consider whether stellar collision explain observed depletion red giant galactic center model stellar population two different imf miller-scalo much flatter imf former case low-mass main-sequence star dominate population collision unable remove red giant pc although brighter red giant much closer may deplete via collision stellar-mass black hole much flatter imf stellar population dominate compact remnant i.e black hole white dwarf neutron star common collision main-sequence star compact remnant encounter likely destroy main-sequence star thus prevent evolution red giant way red-giant population could deplete pc match observation case imply galactic center contain much large population stellar-mass black hole would expect regular imf may turn implication formation growth central supermassive black hole
