 stochastic stellar cluster imf model impact integrated cluster parameter determination stellar cluster regularly use study evolution host galaxy except nearby galaxy study rely interpretation integrated cluster property especially integrated photometry observe use multiple filter i.e spectral energy distribution sed allow interpretation observation present large set galev cluster model use realistic approach adopt stochastically-sampled stellar imf provide model wide range cluster mass msun metallicities fe h dex foreground extinction regularly use filter analyze various set stochastic cluster seds fit non-stochastic model procedure commonly use field identify caveat quantify fitting uncertainty associate standard procedure show yield highly unreliable fitting result especially low-mass cluster
