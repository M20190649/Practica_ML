 limitation anomalous microwave emission emissivity many study anomalous microwave emission ame compute ame emissivity compare strength ame detect different region value usually define ratio intensity ame cm thermal dust emission mu m. however study galactic dust emission show intensity thermal dust emission mu strongly dependent dust temperature severe implication ame emissivity define way work illustrate quantify effect find ame emissivity decrease factor dust temperature k. therefore conclude compute ame emissivity relative mu emission allow accurate comparison ame observe different environment mind investigate use tracer dust emission compute ame emissivity ultimately conclude despite difficulty derive value column density dust would suitable quantity compute ame emissivity
