 dynamical mass segregation short timescale discuss observation theory star cluster formation argue cluster form dynamically cool subvirial substructure perform ensemble simulation cool clumpy fractal cluster show often dynamically mass segregate timescales far short expect simple model mass segregation come production short-lived dense core show cluster like orion nebula cluster star msun dynamically mass segregate within current age cluster therefore observed mass segregation apparently dynamically young cluster need primordial could result rapid violent early dynamical evolution
