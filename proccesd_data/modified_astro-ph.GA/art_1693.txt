 direct n-body simulation globular cluster palomar present first ever direct n -body computation old milky way globular cluster entire life time star-by-star basis use recent gpu hardware bonn university perform comprehensive set n -body calculation model distant outer halo globular cluster palomar pal vary initial condition aim find initial n -body model reproduce observational data best term basic parameter i.e half-light radius mass velocity dispersion furthermore focus reproduce stellar mass function slope pal find significantly shallow globular cluster model reproduce pal 's basic parameter reasonably well find dynamical mass segregation alone explain mass function slope pal start canonical kroupa initial mass function imf order seek explanation discrepancy compute additional initial model vary degree primordial mass segregation well flattened imf necessary degree primordial mass segregation turn high modelling show initial condition pal gas expulsion must half-mass radius pc mass odot possibly mass segregation already establish non-canonical imf deplete low-mass star condition might obtain violent early gas-expulsion phase embedded cluster bear mass segregation large galactocentric radius cluster likely survive bound entities destructive gas-expulsion process seem uncover pal addition compute model primordial binary fraction test population effect cluster 's evolution
