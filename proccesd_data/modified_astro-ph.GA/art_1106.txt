 magnetic field regulate infall disc around massive protostar cepheus hw present polarization observation -ghz methanol maser around massive protostar cepheus hw associated disc data take multi-element radio link interferometer network maser polarization use determine full three-dimensional magnetic field structure around cepheus hw observation suggest maser probe large scale magnetic field isolated pocket compressed field find magnetic field predominantly align along protostellar outflow perpendicular molecular dust disc three-dimensional magnetic field orientation measurement magnetic field strength along line sight able determine high density material maser occur thread large scale magnetic field mg. indicate protostellar environment au cepheus hw slightly supercritical lambda approximately relation density magnetic field consistent collapse along magnetic field line thus observation indicate magnetic field likely regulate accretion onto disc magnetic field dominate turbulent energy approximately factor three sufficiently strong crucial component stabilize massive accretion disc sustain high accretion rate need massive star-formation
