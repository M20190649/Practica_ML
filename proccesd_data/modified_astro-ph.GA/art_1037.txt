 global density slope-anisotropy inequality start central density slope-anisotropy theorem evans recent investigation show involved density slope-anisotropy inequality hold center radius i.e globally large class spherical system positive phase-space distribution function present additional analytical case extend validity global density slope-anisotropy inequality new result several numerical evidence absence know counter-examples lead u conjecture global density slope-anisotropy inequality could actually universal property spherical system positive distribution function
