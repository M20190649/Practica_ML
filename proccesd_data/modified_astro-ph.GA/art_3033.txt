 binary disruption massive black hole hypervelocity star star tidal disruption event examine whether disrupt binary star fuel black hole growth mechanism tidal disruption produce single hypervelocity star hvs eject high velocity former companion star bound black hole cluster bound star form orbital diffusion allow black hole accrete star tidal disruption rate comparable capture rate milky way hvss star cluster imply similar rate -- yr binary disruption rate consistent estimate tidal disruption rate nearby galaxy imply significant black hole growth disrupt binary gyr time scale
