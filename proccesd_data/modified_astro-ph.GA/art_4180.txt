 polyynyl-substituted pah molecule dib carrier polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah molecule long consider promising candidate carrier diffuse interstellar band dibs pah-dib hypothesis however raise two major issue first number interstellar pah specie potentially order magnitude large number dibs second absorption spectrum pah general dominate band find uv wavelength conversely dibs absent uv wavelength domain arise visible near ir wavelength issue necessarily weaken pah-dib hypothesis actually allow u refine context analyze uv vi absorption spectrum pah molecule isolate ne matrix propose polyynyl-substituted pahs similar specie valid candidate carrier dibs finally possible lifecycle dib-carrying pahs present
