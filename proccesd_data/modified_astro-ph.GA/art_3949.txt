 structure radial equilibrium filamentary molecular cloud recent dust continuum survey show filamentary structure ubiquitous along galactic plane study global property gain momentum recently still far fully understand origin stability theory invoke magnetic field formulate help explain stability filament however observation need test prediction paper investigate structure radial equilibrium five filamentary molecular cloud aim determine role magnetic field may play use continuum molecular line observation obtain physical property e.g mass temperature pressure find filament low lineal mass compare lineal virial mass virial parameter shape dust continuum emission suggest filament may confine toroidal dominate magnetic field
