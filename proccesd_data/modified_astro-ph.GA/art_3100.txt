 distance dark cloud compare extinction distance maser parallax distance test two different method use near-infrared extinction estimate distance dark cloud first quadrant galaxy use large near infrared mass ukidss survey vlbi parallax measurement maser around massive young star provide direct bias-free measurement distance dark cloud compare extinction distance estimate maser parallax distance also compare distance kinematic distance include recent re-calibrations galactic rotation curve extinction distance method agree maser parallax distance within error time depend method input survey time outside crowd galactic center although sample size small extinction distance method reproduce maser parallax distance good kinematic distance furthermore extinction distance method suffer kinematic distance ambiguity validation give u confidence extinction method may extend additional dark cloud maser parallax available
