 investigate stellar system 's life-time evolution mass function use n-body simulation thesis study several aspect dynamical evolution stellar cluster result simulation single-mass star cluster different initial total mass half-mass radius galactocentric distance report recent study star cluster show linear relation star cluster 's dissolution time two-body relaxation time logarithmic scale find single-mass star cluster show linear relation present new modify initial parameter obtain linear relation single-mass star cluster also evolution multi-mass cluster lifetime presence galaxy investigate simulate multi-mass star cluster nbody code cluster different initial total mass half-mass radius galactocentric distance finally investigate evolution stellar mass function show slope mass function decrease time addition study effect galactocentric distance star cluster evolution mass function
