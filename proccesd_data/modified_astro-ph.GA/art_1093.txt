 non-exponential hydrodynamical growth density-stratified thin keplerian disc short time evolution three dimensional small perturbation study exhibit spectral asymptotic stability thin disc nonetheless show host intensive hydrodynamical activity shape non modal growth initial small perturbation two mechanism lead behavior identify study namely non-resonant excitation vertically confine sound wave stable planar inertia-coriolis mode result linear growth time well resonant coupling two mode lead quadratic growth initial perturbation speculate non modal growth give rise secondary strato-rotational instability thus lead new route turbulence generation thin disc
