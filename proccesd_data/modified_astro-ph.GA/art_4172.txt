 bow-shock high-speed jet faint arcmin diameter out halo evolved helix planetary nebula ngc previous deep optical image ngc feature morphology bow-shock one jet discover faint arcmin diameter halo nebula spatially resolve longslit profile halpha n ii nebular emission line feature obtain bow-shaped feature find halpha radial velocity close systemic heliocentric radial velocity km ngc faint n ii emission line furthermore full width profile match relative motion ngc ambient interstellar medium consequently deduce feature real bow-shock cause motion ngc plough medium proper motion central star also point towards halo feature substantiate interpretation origin similarly n ii line profile reveal jet-like filament indeed collimate outflow suggest morphology around km turbulent width around km s. 's low halpha n ii brightness ratio suggest collisional ionization expect high-speed jet
