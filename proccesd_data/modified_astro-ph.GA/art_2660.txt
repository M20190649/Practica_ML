 radio continuum emission knot dg tau jet context hh jet young star dg tau one source type jet knot detect optical x-ray wavelength aim search use large array observation source radio knot detect compare optical x-ray knot model emission radio knot method analyze archive data also obtain new large array observation source well optical image measure present position knot also model radio emission knot term shock jet intrinsically time-dependent ejection velocity result detect radio knot vla data radio knot within error coincident optical knot also model satisfactorily observed radio flux density shock feature jet intrinsic variability observed radio optical x-ray knot position intepreted four successive knot eject period year travel away source velocity km plane sky conclusion radio optical knot spatially correlate model explain observed radio flux density however x-ray knot appear optical radio counterpart nature remain poorly understood
