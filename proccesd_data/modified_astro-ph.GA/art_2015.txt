 gould 's belt distance survey long baseline interferometry vlbi observation provide position compact radio source accuracy order micro-arcseconds sufficient measure trigonometric parallax proper motion object within pc sun good percent magnetically active young star often associate compact radio emission detectable use vlbi technique show vlbi observation already constrain distance often study nearby region star-formation taurus ophiuchus orion etc start provide information internal structure kinematics briefly describe large project call gould 's belt distance survey design provide detailed view star-formation solar neighborhood use vlbi observation
