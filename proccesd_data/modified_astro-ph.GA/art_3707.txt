 test micron infrared luminosity star formation tracer galactic star form region test relation star formation rate use extra-galactic study region within galaxy nearby molecular cloud imf fully-sampled dust emission micron greatly underestimate star formation rate factor average compare star formation rate determine count ysos total infrared emission good contrast total far-infrared method agree within factor average star formation rate base radio continuum emission massive dense clump form enough massive star total infrared luminosity exceed lsun total infrared micron also agree well nearby low-mass star forming region massive dense clump region
