 mhd simulation magnetic field radio polarization barred galaxy present result three-dimensional fully nonlinear mhd simulation large-scale magnetic field evolution barred galaxy model take consideration dynamo process find obtained magnetic field configuration highly similar observed map polarized intensity barred galaxy modeled vector form coherent structure along bar spiral arm due dynamical influence bar gas form spiral wave go radially outward spiral arm form magnetic arm stay much longer disk gaseous spiral structure additionally modeled total energy magnetic field grows due strong compression shear non-axisymmetrical bar flow differential rotation respectively
