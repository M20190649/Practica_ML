 ami observation anomalous microwave emission perseus molecular cloud present observation know anomalous microwave emission region g perseus molecular cloud ghz perform arcminute microkelvin imager small array high angular resolution observation g microwave wavelength combine microwave data infrared observation mu spitzer space telescope investigate existence microwave infrared correlation angular scale arcmin find overall correlation appear increase towards short infrared wavelength consistent microwave emission produce electric dipole radiation small spin dust grain also find microwave infrared correlation peak mu sigma suggest microwave emission originate population stochastically heat small interstellar dust grain rather polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
