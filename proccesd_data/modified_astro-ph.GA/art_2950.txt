 narrowing impact broaden radio recombination line high principal quantum number recently alexander gulyaev suggest apparent decrease impact broadening radio recombination line see high principal quantum number n may product data reduction process possibly result presence noise telescope spectrum present calculated comparison spectrum interesting proposal however serious problem analysis need point perhaps important fact principal quantum number n width question process generate profile width fit width processed line obtain telescope processing halfwidths generate telescope profile must agree n believe process generated linewidths n meaningful furthermore find apply linewidth reduction factor find alexander gulyaev noise add profile generated profile simulate noise add effect processed width obtain still come close explain narrow see telescope line n value range n conclude need solve mystery completely new approach use different observing technique instead simply manipulation frequency-switched data
