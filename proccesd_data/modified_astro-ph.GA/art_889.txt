 map asymmetric thick disk i. search triaxiality significant asymmetry distribution faint blue star inner galaxy quadrant l degree compare quadrant first report larsen humphreys parker et al greatly expand survey determine spatial extent shape kinematics affected star excess star count subsequently confirm juric et al use sdss data possible explanation asymmetry include merger remnant triaxial thick disk possible interaction bar disk paper describe program wide field photometry map asymmetry fainter magnitude therefore large distance search signature triaxiality extend survey high galactic longitude find evidence excess faint blue star l degree include faint magnitude interval asymmetry star count excess quadrant thus due triaxial thick disk
