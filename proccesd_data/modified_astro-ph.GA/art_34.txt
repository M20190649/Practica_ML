 early evolution star cluster mass function several recent study show star cluster initial mass function cimf well approximate power law indication steepening truncation high mass contribution consider evolution mass function due cluster disruption emphasis part mass function observable first gyr schechter type function use cimf power law index low mass exponential truncation cluster disruption due tidal field host galaxy encounter giant molecular cloud flatten low-mass end mass function always part evolved schechter function approximate power law index mass range hold depend age shift high mass roughly mean cluster mass derive luminosity limit sample increase age similarly due evolutionary fading cluster empirical mass function therefore approximately power law index slightly steep age result illustrate application star cluster population interact galaxy well describe model x sun short mass-dependent disruption time destroy cluster roughly gyr
