 dr oh highly fragmented magnetize turbulent dense core present high-angular-resolution observation massive star form core dr oh mum use submillimeter array sma dense core exhibit overall velocity gradient keplerian-like pattern break center core sma sma locate dust polarization show complex magnetic field compatible toroidal configuration contrast large parsec-scale filament surround core smooth magnetic field total magnetic field strength filament core mg respectively find evidence magnetic field diffusion core scale far beyond expected value ambipolar diffusion possible diffusion arise fast magnetic reconnection presence turbulence dynamic dr oh core appear control energetically equal part magnetic field magneto-hydrodynamic mhd turbulence angular momentum effect angular momentum fast rotating core probably cause observed toroidal field configuration yet gravitation overwhelms force make clear supercritical core mass-to-flux ratio time critical value however simulation show enough high level fragmentation observe au scale thus rotation outflow feedback probably main cause observed fragmentation
