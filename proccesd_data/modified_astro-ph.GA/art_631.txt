 test newtonian gravity aaomega mass-to-light profile four globular cluster test newtonian gravity weak-acceleration regime vital understanding nature gravitational interaction recently claim velocity dispersion profile several globular cluster flatten large radius reminiscent galaxy rotation curve even though globular cluster think contain little dark matter investigate claim use aaomega observation four globular cluster namely one cluster claim make velocity dispersion include comparison previous study find statistically significant flattening velocity dispersion large radius target cluster therefore infer observed dynamic require globular cluster dark matter dominate modification gravity furthermore apply simple dynamical model determine radial mass-to-light profile cluster isothermal rotation cluster also measure exhibit clear rotation possible rotation lack rotation within uncertainty
