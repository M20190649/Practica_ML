 star formation history resolved galaxy i. method present new method determine star formation metal enrichment history resolve stellar system method base fact observed star colour-magnitude diagram certain probability associate isochrone characterise age metallicity fe h i.e form time metallicity isochrone formulate maximum likelihood problem solve genetic algorithm test method synthetic simple complex stellar population also present test use real data open globular cluster able determine parameter cluster fe h agree well result find literature test complex stellar population show recover star formation history age-metallicity relation accurately finally look history carina dwarf galaxy use deep bvi data result compare well know history carina
