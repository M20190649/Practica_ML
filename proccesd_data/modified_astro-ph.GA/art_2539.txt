 point source approximation nearby cosmic-ray source paper check detail validity widely adopt point source approximation nearby cosmic-ray cr source energy independent escape model cr source show young nearby source point source approximation break low energy cr spectrum depend size morphology source apply nearby supernova remnant snrs find approximation break individual remnant like vela interestingly still hold good combined total spectrum earth moreover also find result obtain simple approximation quite different calculate energy dependent escape model favor diffusive shock acceleration model inside snrs study suggest snrs main source cr galaxy commonly adopt point source model energy independent escape scenario appear flaw cr study nearby snrs
