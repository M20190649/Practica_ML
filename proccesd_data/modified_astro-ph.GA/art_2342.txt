 propagation highly efficient star formation ngc survey line nh h maser toward molecular cloud l extended hii region ngc angular resolution use kashima -m telescope find five clump nh emission size -- pc mass -- sun molecular gas clump similar gas kinetic temperature -- k line width -- km s. however different star formation activity concentration t-tauri type star association h maser source find star formation activity relate geometry hii region clump associate t-tauri type star cluster high star formation efficiency -- clump locate near boundary hii region molecular cloud therefore suggest star formation efficiency increase triggered star formation
