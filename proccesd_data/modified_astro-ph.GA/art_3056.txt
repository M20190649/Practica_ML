 leo iv v possible dwarf galaxy pair last year see discovery many faint ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy around milky way among pair satellite call leo iv leo v. pair find large distance milky way kpc respectively rather small difference radial distance fact also show close project distance sky lead idea might see new pair bound galaxy like magellanic cloud paper investigate speculation mean simple integration code confirm result full n-body simulation luminous mass faint dwarf far low allow bind simulate pair assume extend dark matter halo result show minimum dark matter mass require pair bind rather high range x msun x msun within virial radius compute mass dark matter within commonly adopt radius pc show model well within predicted range dark matter content satellite faint therefore conclude could possible two galaxy constitute bound pair
