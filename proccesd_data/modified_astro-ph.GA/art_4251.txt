 long-term evolution decay mhd turbulence multiphase ism supersonic turbulence interstellar medium ism believe decay rapidly within flow crossing time irrespective degree magnetization however general consensus decay magnetohydrodynamic mhd turbulence relies local isothermal simulation unable take account role global structure magnetic field ism utilize three-dimensional mhd simulation include interstellar cooling heating investigate decay mhd turbulence within cold neutral medium sheet embed warm neutral medium early evolution turbulent kinetic energy consistent previous result decay compressible mhd turbulence characterize rapid energy decay power-law form e propto short decay time compare flow crossing time initial magnetic field strong perpendicular sheet however long-term evolution kinetic energy show significant amount turbulent energy sim e still remain even ten flow cross time model periodic boundary condition decay rate also greatly reduce field strength increase initial boundary condition boundary condition completely isolated sheet analyze velocity power spectrum remain turbulence show in-plane incompressible motion parallel sheet dominate later time
