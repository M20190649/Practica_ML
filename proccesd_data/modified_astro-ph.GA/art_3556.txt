 white dwarf cooling sequence cosmochronology evolution white dwarf simple gravothermal process mean luminosity function i.e number white dwarf per unit bolometric magnitude unit volume function bolometric magnitude monotonically increase function decrease abruptly consequence finite age galaxy precision accuracy white dwarf luminosity function obtain recent large survey together improved quality theoretical model evolution white dwarf allow fee hope near future possible reconstruct history different galactic population
