 pulse-width statistic radio pulsar ii importance core profile component perform statistical analysis half-power pulse-widths core component average pulsar profile confirm existence low bound distribution half-power pulse-width versus pulsar period w deg p find rankin use much large database find w deg p pulsar double-pole interpulses measurement core component width possible hand single-pole interpulse case lie swarm pulsar boundary line use monte carlo simulation base exact geometrical calculation find rankin 's method estimation inclination angle alpha asin deg p w pulsar core component quite good approximation except small angle alpha almost align rotators
