 long-term timing millisecond pulsar gravitational wave detection abridge thesis present long-term timing result millisecond pulsar msps predict timing may detect gravitational wave gws major untested prediction general relativity result demonstrate investigated msps sufficient stability enable detection experiment furthermore timing data bright source show time sub- ns precision may achievable therefore gw detection within next decade likely finally use data place strong limit strength predicted background gws
