 compare gaseous stellar orbit spiral potential generally assume gas galactic disk follow closely non self-intersecting periodic stellar orbit order test common assumption perform mhd simulation galactic-like disk influence spiral galactic potential also calculate actual orbit gas parcel compare stable periodic stellar orbit galactic potential position find gaseous orbit approach periodic stellar orbit far major orbital resonances gas orbit initialize give galactocentric distance different azimuth different scattering conspicuous certain galactocentric radius also contrast stellar behaviour near high order resonance gas follow nearly circular orbit much short radial excursion star also since gas settle steady state gaseous orbit necessarily close
