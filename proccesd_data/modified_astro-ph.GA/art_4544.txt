 unbound star-forming molecular cloud explore whether observed molecular cloud could include substantial population unbound cloud use simulation include turbulence gravity able match observed relation naturally reproduce observed scatter cloud size-linewidth coefficient fixed surface density identify source scatter spread intrinsic virial parameter thus observational trend require cloud exist state dynamical equilibrium demonstrate cloud virial parameter accurately determine observationally appropriate size estimator simulate cloud eventually form collapse core regardless whether cloud bind overall support idea molecular cloud bind form star observe property like nearby low-mass cloud
