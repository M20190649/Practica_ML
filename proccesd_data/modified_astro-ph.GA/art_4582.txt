 density dependence protostellar luminosity class source collaborative accretion class protostars three high-mass star-forming region find correlation among local projected density class protostars summed flux protostars protostellar luminosity wise micron band brighter class source form higher-density higher-flux region low luminosity source form anywhere correlation depend slightly number neighbor consider could include size-of-sample effect initial mass function i.e. large number include rare massive star luminosity seem vary neighborhood nearby protostars value proportional high density region high value class luminosity partially relate accretion rate luminosity correlation consistent competitive accretion model although collaborative competitive correlation also consistent primordial mass segregation could explain stellar initial mass function resemble dense core mass function even core form multiple star
