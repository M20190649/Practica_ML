 mass distribution rotation curve galaxy mass distribution galaxy determine dynamical photometric method rotation curve major tool determine dynamical mass distribution milky way spiral galaxy photometric statistical method utilizes luminosity profile optical infrared observation assumes empirical value mass-to-luminosity l ratio convert luminosity mass chapter dynamical method describe detail rotation curve mass distribution milky way nearby spiral galaxy present dynamical method categorize two method decomposition method direct method former fit rotation curve calculated curve assume several mass component bulge disk halo adjust dynamical parameter component explanation give mass profile de vaucouleurs law exponential disk dark halo profile infer numerical simulation another method direct method mass distribution directly calculate data rotation velocity without employ mass model result method present galactic structure discuss term mass rotation curve mass distribution external galaxy also discuss fundamental mass structure show universal
