 radial migration sun galactic disk physic gravitational effect galactic bar spiral structure present physical equation differ conventionally use equation application motion sun treat speed sun take consistent oort constant galactic radial migration sun less kpc four-armed spiral structure sun remain existence within galactocentric distance kpc result practically independent spiral structure strength thus radial distance change within value kpc galactic radial migration sun less kpc two-armed spiral structure sun remain existence within galactocentric distance kpc result strongly depend spiral structure strength angular speed spiral arm radial distance change within value kpc observational argument prefer relevant radial migration sun milky way characterize two-arm spiral structure
