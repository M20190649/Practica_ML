 dimethyl ether ground state v low two torsionally excited state v v high-mass star-forming region g goal paper determine respective importance solid state vs. gas phase reaction formation dimethyl ether do detailed analysis excitation property ground state torsionally excited state v v toward high-mass star-forming region g atacama pathfinder experiment submillimeter telescope perform spectral line survey observed spectrum model assume local thermal equilibrium ch och detect ground state torsionally excited state v v line detect first time emission model isothermal source structure well non-uniform spherical structure non-uniform source model one abundance jump dimethyl ether sufficient fit emission two component need isothermal model suggest dimethyl ether present extended region envelope trace non-uniform density temperature structure type model furthermore suggest dimethyl ether present gas warm k small fraction present temperature k. dimethyl ether present cooler gas likely form solid state gas phase formation probably dominant k. finally v v torsionally excite state easily excite density temperature condition g thus likely detectable hot core well
