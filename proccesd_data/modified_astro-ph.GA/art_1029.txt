 integrated parameter star cluster comparison theory observation abridge paper present integrated magnitude colour synthetic cluster integrated parameter obtain whole cluster population well main-sequence ms population star cluster also estimate observe integrated magnitude colour ms population galactic open cluster lmc smc star cluster find colour evolution ms population star cluster affect stochastic fluctuation however fluctuation significantly affect colour evolution whole cluster population fluctuation maximum v-i colour age range log age evolution integrated colour ms population cluster milky way lmc smc obtain present study well explain present synthetic cluster model observed integrated b-v colour ms population lmc star cluster age geq myr seem distribute around z model whereas v-i colour find bluer predict z model v-i vs b-v two-colour diagram ms population milky way star cluster show fair agreement observation present model however diagram lmc smc cluster indicate observe v-i colour relatively blue possible reason anomaly discuss
