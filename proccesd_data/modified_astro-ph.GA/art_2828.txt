 barnard evidence fragmentation dense molecular clump center barnard b complex region pipe nebula form small stellar cluster previous analysis high resolution near-ir dust extinction map reveal nuclear region b massive mostly quiescent clump solar mass clump show monolithic profile possibly indicate clump way collapse evident fragmentation could lead another group star system paper present new analysis compare dust extinction map new dust emission radio-continuum map high spatial resolution confirm clump show significant evidence prestellar fragmentation scale small probed previously
