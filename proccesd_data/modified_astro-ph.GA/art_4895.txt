 mapping interstellar cloud infrared light scatter dust tmc- n mapping near-infrared nir scatter light recent method study interstellar cloud complement commonly use method like dust emission extinction goal study usability method large scale compare property filament use nir scattering method also study radiation field difference grain emissivity diffuse dense area use scatter j h k band surface brightness wfcam-observations map filament tmc- n taurus cover area dx correspond pc convert data optical depth compare result nir extinction herschel observation submm dust emission see filament scattered light three nir band note wfcam observation tmc- n show notably low intensity previous result corona australis use method show radiative transfer simulation predict similar scatter surface brightness level see observation however change assumption background change result simulation notably derive emissivity use optical depth j band independent tracer column density obtain opacity sigma um value x cm h depend assumption extinction curve change result value twice high obtain diffuse area low limit early result dense area show nir scattering valuable tool make high resolution map conclude however nir scatter observation complicate data show relatively low-level artefact suggest caution planning interpret observation
