 gravity turbulence ii evolve column density pdfs molecular cloud recently show molecular cloud exhibit unique shape column density probability distribution function npdf instead cloud without star formation seem possess lognormal distribution cloud active star formation develope power-law tail high column density lognormal behavior npdf interpret term turbulent motion dominate dynamic cloud power-law behavior occur cloud dominate gravity present contribution use thermally bi-stable numerical simulation cloud formation evolution show indeed two regime understand term formation evolution molecular cloud narrow lognormal regime appear cloud assemble however global gravitational contraction occur initial density fluctuation enhance result first wider lognormal npdf later power-law npdf thus suggest observed npdf molecular cloud manifestation global gravitationally contract state also show contrary recent suggestion exact value power-law slope unique depend projection cloud observe
