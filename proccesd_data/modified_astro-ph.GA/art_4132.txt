 hi column density power spectrum six nearby spiral galaxy propose method determine power spectrum hi column density fluctuation use radio-interferometric observation -cm emission ism galaxy use estimate power spectrum six nearly face nearby spiral galaxy earlier work show power spectrum well fit power law slope around across length-scales sim rm kpc sim rm kpc amplitude however undetermined present work determine amplitude hi column density power spectrum find hi column density n rm hi express unit rm cm mean square fluctuation range sim sim amplitude power spectrum find tightly correlate hi mass fraction galaxy physical process responsible scale-invariant fluctuation however present know
