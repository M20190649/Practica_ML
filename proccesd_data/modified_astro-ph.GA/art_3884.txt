 evolution second generation star stellar disk globular nuclear cluster omega centauri test case globular cluster gcs many nuclear cluster ncs show evidence host multiple generation stellar population young stellar population ncs appear reside disk like structure include nuclear cluster galactic center well kinematic study anomalous globular cluster omega centauri think possibly former dwarf galaxy galactic nucleus show evidence hosting central kinematically cold disk component observation suggest formation second multiple generation star may occur flattened disk like structure use detailed n-body simulation explore possible evolution stellar disk embed globular cluster follow long term evolution disk like structure similar observe omega centauri study property find stellar-disk like origin second generation stellar population leave behind significant kinematic signature property cluster include anisotropic distribution low velocity dispersion use constrain origin second generation star dynamical evolution
