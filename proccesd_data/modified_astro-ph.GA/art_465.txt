 akari detection far-infrared dust emission halo ngc present new far-infrared fir image edge-on starburst galaxy ngc obtain far-infrared surveyor fis onboard akari wavelength um um clearly detect fir dust emission extend halo galaxy two filamentary emission structure extend galactic disk kpc northern kpc northwestern direction spatial coincidence x-ray plasma outflow extended fir emission likely represent outflowing dust entrain superwinds ratio surface brightness um um suggest temperature dust halo get higher region far disk imply exist extra dust heating source halo galaxy
