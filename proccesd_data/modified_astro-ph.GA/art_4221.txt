 radial migration bar-dominated disk galaxy impact chemical evolution study radial migration chemical evolution bar-dominated disk galaxy analyze result fully self-consistent high resolution n-body sph simulation find different behaviour gas star particle gas within corotation drive central region bar form pseudo-bulge disky-bulge undergo negligible radial displacement outside bar region star undergo substantial radial migration time cause first transient spiral arm later bar despite important amount radial migration occur model impact chemical property limited reason relatively flat abundance profile due rapid early evolution whole disk show implication radial migration chemical evolution study good accuracy post-processing result n-body sph calculation simple chemical evolution model detail chemistry parametrized description radial migration find radial migration impact chemical evolution directly move around long-lived agent nucleosynthesis like e.g snia agb star thus alter abundance profile gas indirectly move around long-lived tracer chemical evolution thus affect stellar metallicity profile local age-metallicity relation metallicity distribution star etc
