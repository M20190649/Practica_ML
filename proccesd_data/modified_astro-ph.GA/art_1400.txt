 model mid-infrared variability circumstellar disk non-axisymmetric structure recent mid-infrared observation young stellar object find significant variation possibly indicative change structure circumstellar disk previous model variability restrict axisymmetric perturbation disk consider simple model non-axisymmetric variation inner disk warp spiral wave find precession non-axisymmetric structure produce negligible flux variation change height structure lead significant change mid-infrared flux apply model observation young stellar object lrll suggest observed variability could explain warped inner disk variable scale height suggest variability observe young stellar object could explain non-axisymmetric disturbance inner disk variability would easily observable future study
