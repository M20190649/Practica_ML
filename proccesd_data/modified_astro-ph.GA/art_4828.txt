 radial anisotropy limit stellar system follow earlier author re-examine constraint radial velocity anisotropy generic stellar system use argument phase space density positivity stability separability know although majority commonly use system maximum anisotropy less half logarithmic density slope emph i.e beta gamma exception separable model large central anisotropy present new exceptional case above-threshold anisotropy locally isotropic center nevertheless model non-separable maintain positivity analysis suggest region above-threshold anisotropy related region possible secular instability might observe self-consistent galaxy short-lived phase equilibrium solution collisionless system
