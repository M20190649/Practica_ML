 lognormal intensity distribution fuv continuum background shortward ly-alpha diffuse far-ultraviolet fuv continuum radiation longward ly-alpha well know correlate dust emission um however claim fuv continuum background shortward ly-alpha show weak correlation um emission paper observational data diffuse fuv radiation far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer reexamine order investigate correlation diffuse fuv radiation shortward ly-alpha um emission large fluctuation confirm linear-linear correlation plot good correlation find log-log plot large fluctuation linear-linear plot thus poor correlation fuv um intensity attribute lognormal property fuv intensity distribution standard deviation intensity distribution fuv radiation shortward ly-alpha find sigma log result consistent obtain fuv radiation longward also dust column density measurement various molecular cloud imply diffuse fuv radiation shortward ly-alpha dust-scattered light turbulent interstellar medium diffuse fuv data obtain voyager mission also investigate however much wider random fluctuation find compare fuse data likely due systematic difficulty data reduction voyager data
