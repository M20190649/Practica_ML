 rotate thin-disk galaxy eye newton numerically solve mass distribution rotate disk base newton 's law motion gravitation demonstrate observed flat rotation curve spiral galaxy correspond exponentially decrease mass density galactic center part except within central core near periphery edge hence believe galaxy describe model consistent see eye newton although newton 's law kepler 's law seem yield result apply planet solar system show lead quite different result describe stellar dynamic disk galaxy keplerian dynamic may equivalent newtonian dynamic special circumstance generally case thus conclusion draw calculation base keplerian dynamic often likely erroneous use describe rotate disk galaxy
