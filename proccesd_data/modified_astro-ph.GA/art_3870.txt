 constraint free-free emission anomalous microwave emission source perseus molecular cloud present observation perform green bank telescope ghz three strip coincident anomalous microwave emission feature previously identify perseus molecular cloud ghz small array observation determine level low frequency ghz emission detect significant extended emission region compute conservative sigma upper limit fraction free-free emission ghz three strip indicate level emission ghz account emission observe ghz additionally find low frequency emission spatially correlate emission observe ghz result indicate emission observe perseus molecular cloud ghz indeed excess low frequency emission hence confirm anomalous nature
