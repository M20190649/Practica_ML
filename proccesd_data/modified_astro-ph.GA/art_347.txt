 phase-resolved faraday rotation pulsar detect significant rotation measure variation bright pulsar function pulse longitude additional sample pulsar show rather constant rm phase yet small degree rm fluctuation visible least case case find rotation polarization position angle across ghz observe band consistent wavelength-squared law interstellar faraday rotation provide first time convince evidence rm variation across pulse largely due interstellar scattering although exclude magnetospheric faraday rotation may still minor contribution alternative explanation phenomenon like erroneous de-dispersion presence non-orthogonal polarization mode exclude observed phase-resolved rm variation common amongst pulsar many previously measure pulsar rms may error much ten rad m-
