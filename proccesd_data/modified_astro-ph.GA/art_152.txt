 quasar metal abundance fir luminosity compare metallicities high-redshift quasar star formation rate sfr host galaxy use measurement broad emission line far-infrared fir luminosity fir emission indicate level ongoing massive starbursts galaxy whereas abundance metal gas surround quasar indicate amount star formation occur visible quasar phase begin result study use constrain late stage starburst-quasar evolution detect high metallicities throughout sample several time solar confirm star formation must begin visible quasar phase however detect trend metallicity versus current sfr
