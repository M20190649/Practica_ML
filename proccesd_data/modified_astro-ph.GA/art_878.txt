 model proper motion beyond galactic bulge analyse radial tangential velocity field galaxy see sun use first approximation simple axisymmetric model compare corresponding field barred n-body model milky way provide global description quantity miss literature show take large value susceptible use future observation even source well beyond galactic center absolute large proper motion occur distance slightly behind galactic center time large high local proper motion due galactic differential rotation large proper motion well beyond galactic center well within current astrometric accuracy
