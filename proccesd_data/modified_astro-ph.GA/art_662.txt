 infer dynamic stellar stream via distance gradient present simple result distance gradient along stream use derive transverse velocity i.e proper motion along line-of-sight velocity also know show application mock orbit illustrate validity usage less extended object globular cluster satellite galaxy tidally disrupt result apply small-angle approximation procedure rely energy angular momentum conservation hence require galactic model order deduce local velocity vector stream
