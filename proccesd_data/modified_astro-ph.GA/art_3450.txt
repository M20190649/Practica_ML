 photometric distance young star inner galactic disk present result first extensive deep ccd photometric survey carry field open cluster trumpler object constellation sagittarius far galaxy center look young star clump might plausibly associate spiral structure wide-field ubvi photometry combine infrared information allow u reconstruct distribution redden distance young star field use color-color color-magnitude diagram analysis data combine extensive spectroscopy take literature show real entity trumpler open cluster far firmly state fact instead find relatively compact group star confine small distance range find star associate trumpler indeed superposition early type star see along line sight extend several kiloparsecs beyond even center galaxy demonstrate distance range become possible generate color-magnitude diagram resemble open cluster way analysis indicate consider open cluster characterize significant age spread stellar continuum reach maximum number star approximately kpc sun distance scutum-crux arm approximately time analyze way early type star distribute distance find stellar group may link within distance error inner spiral arm galaxy include near kpc arm approximately kpc sun however young star seem trace strongly inner spiral arm since distribute evenly across several kiloparsecs toward center galaxy
