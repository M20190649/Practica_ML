 internal structure stellar cluster geometry star formation study internal structure star cluster provide important clue concern formation mechanism dynamical evolution observational numerical evidence indicate open cluster evolve initial clumpy structure presumably direct consequence formation fractal medium toward centrally condensed state simple picture however several drawback young cluster exhibit radial pattern maybe reflect early effect gravity primordial gas also evolved cluster show fractal pattern either survive time generate subsequently unknown mechanism additionally fractal structure open cluster much clumpier average structure interstellar medium milky way although principle similar structure expect summarize discuss observational numerical result concern subject
