 stability non-isothermal bonnor-ebert sphere aim aim derive stability condition non-isothermal bonnor-ebert sphere compare physical property critical non-isothermal isothermal gas sphere configuration serve model prestellar core gravitational collapse method stability condition non-isothermal sphere derive construct expression derivative boundary pressure respect core volume temperature distribution determine mean radiative transfer calculation base stability analysis derive physical parameter critical core mass range sun addition property roughly jupiter-mass core briefly examine result low-mass end critical non-isothermal sphere low central density slightly large physical radius corresponding isothermal sphere i.e one mass average temperature temperature decrease towards core centre become steep towards small mass central density become high slope depend adopt dust model find critical dimensionless radius increase isothermal value xi low-mass core sun however mass-range study change within isothermal value conclusion density structure non-isothermal isothermal bonnor-ebert sphere give mass fairly similar however present model predict clear difference average temperature physical radius especially low-mass core temperature gradient probably implication chemistry observed line emission also find hydrostatic jupiter-mass core radius less au would high boundary pressure compare typical pressure interstellar space
