 fragmentation dynamically condense radiative layer paper stability dynamically condense radiative gas layer investigate linear analysis time-dependent self-similar solution describe dynamical condensing radiative gas layer use unperturbed state consider perturbation perpendicular parallel direction condensation transverse wave number perturbation define k k find condensing gas layer unstable however growth rate low become nonlinear dynamical condensation k ne general perturbation equation constant wave number reduce eigenvalue problem due unsteady unperturbed state therefore direct numerical integration perturbation equation perform comparison eigenvalue problem neglect time evolution unperturbed state also solve result agree well gas layer unstable wave number growth rate depend little wave number behaviour perturbation specify kl mathrm cool centre cooling length l mathrm cool represent length sound wave travel cooling time kl mathrm cool gg perturbation grow isobarically kl mathrm cool perturbation grow part different collapse time without interaction since growth rate sufficiently high long perturbation become nonlinear dynamical condensation therefore accord linear analysis cooling layer expect split fragment various scale
