 reconnection weakly stochastic b-fields study two dimensional turbulent magnetic reconnection compressible fluid gas pressure dominate limit use open boundary condition start harris current sheet configuration uniform total pressure small perturbation vector potential initiate laminar reconnection sweet-parker rate allow evolve several dynamical time subsequently sub-alfvenic turbulence produce random forcing small wave number magnetic field topology near current sheet strongly affect turbulence however find result reconnection speed depend resistivity contrast previous result three dimension find evidence fast reconnection reconnection speed exhibit large variation time average increase smoothly strength turbulence
