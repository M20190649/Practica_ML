 far ultraviolet diffuse emission large magellanic cloud present first observation diffuse radiation far ultraviolet -- aa large magellanic cloud base observation make far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer fraction total radiation field emit diffuse radiation typically -- high near n exciting star indicate much emission due nearby star much less light scatter far ultraviolet long wavelength stellar radiation go heat interstellar dust
