 dynamo action thermally unstable interstellar flow numerous study investigate role thermal instability regulate phase transition cold cloudy warm diffuse medium interstellar medium considerable interest also devote investigate property turbulence thermally unstable flow special emphasis molecular cloud possibility star formation study investigate another setting instability may important namely effect dynamo action interstellar flow setup consider three dimensional periodic cube gas initially weak magnetic field subject heating cooling property thermal instability provoke certain temperature regime dynamo action establish external forcing flow field compare result cool function exactly net effect thermally unstable regime find following critical reynolds number onset large-scale dynamo observe roughly double thermally stable versus unstable run conclusion thermal instability make large-scale dynamo action difficult whereas density magnetic field observe almost completely uncorrelated thermally stable case investigate action thermal instability observe produce positive correlation form b propto rho correlation rather weak addition observe break limit high density
