 chlorine sulfur nearby planetary nebula h ii region derive chlorine abundance sample nearby planetary nebula pne h ii region best available spectrum use nearly homogeneous procedure derive abundance object find cl h abundance ratio show similar value h ii region pne support previous interpretation underabundance find oxygen h ii region due depletion oxygen atom organic refractory dust component element bias introduce ionization correction factor derived abundance important illustrate sulfur use photoionization model even low-ionization pne derive sulfur abundance low real one dex difference find abundance derive h ii region similar h reach dex
