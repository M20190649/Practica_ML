 star formation metal-poor gas cloud observation molecular cloud metal-poor environment typically find much high star formation rate one would expect base observe co luminosity molecular gas mass infer finding understood one assume conversion factor co luminosity h mass much large low metallicity system nearby molecular cloud however unclear whether factor work whether star formation rate cloud directly sensitive metallicity gas investigate perform numerical simulation coupled dynamical chemical thermal evolution model cloud metallicities range z solar z solar find star formation rate model cloud little sensitivity metallicity reduce metallicity gas two order magnitude delay onset star formation cloud cloud free-fall time reduce time-averaged star formation rate factor two hand chemical state cloud highly sensitive metallicity low metallicities cloud completely dominate atomic gas result confirm co-to-h conversion factor system depend strongly metallicity also show precise value highly time-dependent integrate co luminosity metal-poor cloud dominate emission short-lived gravitationally collapse region finally find evidence star formation rate per unit h mass increase decrease metallicity owe much small h fraction present low metallicity cloud
