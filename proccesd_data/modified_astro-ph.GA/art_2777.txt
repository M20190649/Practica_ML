 detection hf emission orion bar clumpy density structure photon-dominated region well establish physical property clump surround interclump medium approximately know aim paper constrain physical chemical condition orion bar prototypical nearby photon-dominated region present observation hf j line appear emission toward orion bar compare brightness line non-lte radiative transfer calculation large width hf line suggest origin emission interclump gas collisional excitation h interclump gas underpredicts observed line intensity factor contrast origin line dense clump require density cm time high previous estimate unlikely however electron impact excitation reproduce observation k n e cm expect interclump gas conclude hf emission signpost molecular gas high electron density similar condition may apply active galactic nucleus hf also appear emission
