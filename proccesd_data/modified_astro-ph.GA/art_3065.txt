 simple perspective mass-area relationship molecular cloud despite year study mass-area relationship within among cloud still poorly understood observationally theoretically modern extinction datasets sufficient resolution dynamic range characterize relationship nearby molecular cloud although recent paper use extinction data seem yield different interpretation regard nature universality aspect cloud structure paper try unify various result interpretation account different way cloud property measure analyze interpret mass-area relationship term column density distribution function possible variation within among cloud quantitatively characterize regional variation column density pdf show structure within among clouds posse degree universality pdf mean systematically scale structure size mass scale linearly area
