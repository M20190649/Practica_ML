 iron monoxide nanoparticles carrier mysterious micrometer emission feature post-asymptotic giant branch star prominent mysterious emission feature peak micrometer -- historically know micrometer feature -- see two dozen galactic magellanic cloud carbon-rich post-asymptotic giant branch post-agb star nature carrier remain unknown since first detection micrometer feature dozen material suggest possible carrier candidate however none accept either require much material compare available circumstellar shell around post-agb star exhibit additional emission feature see micrometer source recently iron monoxide feo nanoparticles seem promising carrier candidate fe abundant element feo emits exclusively micrometer work use proto-typical protoplanetary nebula hd test case examine feo nanoparticles carrier micrometer feature model infrared emission feo stochastically heat single stellar photon find feo emits broad micrometer feature explain observed one fe abundance require lock feo exceeds available hd therefore conclude feo nanoparticles unlikely responsible micrometer feature
