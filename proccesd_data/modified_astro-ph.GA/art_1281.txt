 fragmentation expand shell ii thickness matter study analytically development gravitational instability expand shell finite thickness consider three model radial density profile shell analytic uniform-density model ii semi-analytic model obtain numerical solution hydrostatic equilibrium equation iii hydrodynamic simulation show three profile close agreement allow u use first model describe fragment radial direction shell use non-linear equation describe time-evolution uniform oblate spheroid derive growth rate shell fragment different size yield dispersion relation depend shell thickness hence pressure confine shell compare dispersion relation dispersion relation obtain use standard thin-shell analysis show confining pressure low large fragment unstable hand confining pressure high fragment small predict thin-shell analysis become unstable finally compare new dispersion relation result hydrodynamic simulation show two good agreement
