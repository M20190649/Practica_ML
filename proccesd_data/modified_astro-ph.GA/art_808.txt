 lithium abundance main sequence sub-giant star globular cluster ngc present flame giraffe spectroscopy obtain large telescope vlt use observation able first time observe li doublet main sequence star globular cluster also observe li sample sub-giant star b-v colour final sample compose sg star ms star spite fact sg m span temperature range find equivalent width li doublet sg star systematically large ms star suggest high li content among sg star confirm quantitative analysis make use model atmosphere find sg star show average li abundance high dex ms star also detect positive slope li abundance effective temperature high temperature high li abundance sg m star although slope slightly steep m star result provide unambigous evidence li abundance change evolutionary status physical mechanism contribute yet clear since none propose model seem describe accurately observation whether mechanism explain cosmological lithium problem still open question
