 broad-band x-ray spectrum seyfert galaxy mcg present long k suzaku observation one x-ray brightest agn mcg data complement -month swift bat spectrum allow u perform broad-band fit kev range fit perform kev band give consistent result respect previous xmm-newton observation i.e lack soft excess warm absorption along line sight large compton reflection component r absence relativistic component neutral iron k alpha emission line however pin swift bat data include reflection amount drop significantly r relativistic iron line require latter confirm phenomenological analysis restricted energy band kev self-consistent model apply whole broadband data observed reflection component appear associate relativistic component iron k alpha line result scenario though strongly model-dependent require reprocess spectral component compton-thick material must associate accretion disc evidence classical pc-scale torus find narrow core neutral iron k alpha line therefore produce compton-thin material like blr similarly find another seyfert galaxy ngc notable difference mcg present spectral signature accretion disc low accretion rate ngc could explain lack relativistic signature spectrum absence torus source difficult explain since luminosity comparable accretion rate completely different
