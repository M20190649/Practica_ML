 formation low-mass star brown dwarf lecture attempt expose important idea propose explain formation star particular emphasis formation brown dwarf low-mass star first describe important physical process trigger collapse self-gravitating piece fluid regulate star formation rate molecular cloud review various theory propose along year explain origin stellar initial mass function pay particular attention four model namely competitive accretion theory base respectively stop accretion mhd shock turbulent dispersion yet unsettled whether brown dwarfs form low-mass star present theory brown dwarf base disk fragmentation stress uncertainty due radiative feedback magnetic field finally describe result large scale simulation perform explain collapse fragmentation molecular cloud
