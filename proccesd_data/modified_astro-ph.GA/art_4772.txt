 empirical mass-loss law population ii giant spitzer-irac survey galactic globular cluster main aim present work derive empirical mass-loss ml law population ii star first second ascent red giant branch use spitzer infrared array camera irac photometry obtain micron range carefully choose sample galactic globular cluster span entire metallicity range sample vast zoology horizontal branch hb morphology complement irac photometry near-infrared data build suitable color-magnitude color-color diagram identify mass-losing giant star find majority star show color typical cool giant star show excess mid-infrared light large expect photospheric emission plausibly due dust formation mass flow star estimate dust total gas dust ml rate timescales finally calibrate empirical ml law population ii red asymptotic giant branch star vary metallicity find give red giant branch luminosity fraction star lose mass conclude ml episodic active fraction time define duty cycle fraction mass-losing star increase increase stellar luminosity metallicity ml rate estimate reasonable assumption gas-to-dust ratio expansion velocity depend metallicity slowly increase decrease metallicity contrast duty cycle increase increase metallicity net result total ml increase moderately increase metallicity msun every dex fe h population ii asymptotic giant branch star estimate total ml msun nearly constant vary metallicity
