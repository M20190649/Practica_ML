 power spectrum residual rotation curve velocity probe past merger accord lambda cdm cosmological framework galaxy undergo multiple merger history paper propose use power spectrum residual fluctuation rotation curve velocity probe past merger proposition rely assertion merger expect induce large scale flow case major merger shock induce well instability large scale flow shock could generate large scale turbulence whose size comparable galactic disk dimension develop expression relate underlying turbulence spectral function observational power spectrum residual rotation curve velocity relation use test whether turbulence exists give galaxy method apply regular spiral galaxy ngc conclusion undergo minor merger gyr ago
