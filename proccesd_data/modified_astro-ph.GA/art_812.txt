 dry merge explain size evolution early-type galaxy characteristic size early-type galaxy etgs give stellar mass observe increase significantly cosmic time redshift z present popular explanation size evolution etgs grow dissipationless dry merger thus become less compact combine n-body simulation up-to-date scale relation local etgs show explanation problematic dry merger decrease galaxy stellar-mass surface-density enough explain observed size evolution also introduce substantial scatter scaling relation base set simulation estimate major minor dry merger increase half-light radius project velocity dispersion stellar mass respectively imply high-z etgs indeed dense estimate evolve present-day etgs via dry merger present-day etgs assemble stellar mass via dry merger alternatively dry merger could reconcile observation extreme fine tune merger history galaxy property variance assumption full cosmological simulation need evaluate whether fine-tuned solution acceptable
