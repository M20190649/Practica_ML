 galaxy spiral arm nature reveal rotation frequency high resolution n-body simulation use different code initial condition technique reveal two different behaviour rotation frequency transient spiral arm like structure whereas unbarred disk present spiral arm nearly corotatingwith disk particle strong bar model bulge bulge-less quickly develop bar-spiral structure dominant density pattern speed almost constant radius bar strength decrease arm depart bar rigid rotation behave similar unbarred case strong barred model detect frequency space subdominant slow mode large radius agreement previous study however also detect configuration space propose distinctive behaviour dominant spiral mode exploit order constraint nature galactic spiral arm astrometric survey gaia -d spectroscopic survey like califa manga external galaxy
