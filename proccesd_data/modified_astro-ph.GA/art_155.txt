 chemical evolution galactic bulge single double infall model recent work produce wealth data concern chemical evolution galactic bulge star nebula present theoretical model generally adopt limited range constraint frequently use single chemical element usually iron enough describe unambiguously work take account constraint involve many chemical element possible basically obtain bulge nebula star main goal show different scenario describe least partially abundance distribution several distance-independent correlation object three class model develop first one-zone single-infall model second one-zone double-infall model third multizone double infall model show one-zone model single infall episode able reproduce observational data best result achieve use multizone double infall model
