 evidence interaction near starbursting dwarf irregular galaxy ic use deep -cm hi data green bank telescope detect kpc-long gaseous extension associate starbursting dwarf galaxy ic newly-found feature stretch deg northwest large radial velocity gradient reach km low ic systemic velocity region high column density end extension possess coherent velocity gradient km across arcmin transverse extension suggest rotation may satellite galaxy ic hi mass ic x kpc msun mass new extension x kpc msun ic -m orbit use know radial velocity proper motion value ic show hi extension inconsistent trail portion orbit -tidal ram pressure origin seem unlikely argue plausible explanation new feature result recent interaction possible late merger another dwarf galaxy interaction could trigger origin recent starburst ic could also explain existence previously-found counter-rotating hi gas periphery ic interpret originate primordial gas infall
