 schmidt 's conjecture star formation molecular cloud investigate schmidt 's conjecture i.e. star formation rate scale power-law fashion gas density four well-studied local molecular cloud gmcs use bayesian methodology show local schmidt scale relation form sigma k kappa x k beta protostars pc exists within gmcs find schmidt scaling law provide adequate description star formation activity gmcs total number protostars produce cloud give product sigma k k differential surface area distribution function integrate entire cloud cloud 's structure play fundamental role set level star formation activity cloud similar functional form sigma k observed difference total sfrs primarily due difference k cloud coupling sigma k measure k cloud also produce steep jump sfr protostellar production k magnitude finally show global schmidt law relate star formation rate gas mass surface density gmcs consequently observed kennicutt-schmidt scaling relation disk galaxy likely artifact unresolved measurement gmcs result underlying physical law star formation characterize molecular gas
