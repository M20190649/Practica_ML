 molecular cloud distance determination deep nir survey extinction measurement use near infrared ukidss galactic plane survey data make extinction measurement individual star along line sight molecular cloud use exist extinction map inner galaxy provide line sight specific extinction-distance relationship convert measured extinction molecular cloud corresponding distance distance derive independently kinematic method typically use derive distance molecular cloud near far ambiguity near far distance ambiguity resolve cloud distance derive cloud result find good agreement kinematic measurement molecular cloud ambiguity already resolve use hi self-absorption technique
