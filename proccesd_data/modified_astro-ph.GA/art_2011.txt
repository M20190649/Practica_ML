 rapid dynamical mass segregation property fractal star cluster investigate evolution young star cluster use n-body simulation confirm subvirial fractal-structured cluster dynamically mass segregate short timescale within myr adopt modified minimum-spanning-tree mst method measure degree mass segregation demonstrate star escape cluster 's potential important temporal dependence mass segregation cluster form initial velocity distribution also affect degree mass segregation depend radius outer part cluster would expand without undergo collapse velocity space find 'inverse mass segregation indicate massive star high velocity dispersion lower-mass counterpart
