 helium line detection eldwim ghz helium line observation towards galactic position use westerbork synthesis radio telescope wsrt report observation make towards nearby position already hydrogen line detect sufficiently high intensity geq mk ghz approach give fair chance detection helium line well keep mind relative abundance helium respect hydrogen care also take avoid presence hii region along line sight line emission originates extend diffuse low density ionize component eldwim galaxy observation result detection helium line towards position signal noise ratio snr sigma attempt make associate detection non-detection helium line presence surround hii region weighting scheme account nearby pc hii region distance factor produce favourable result see weight scheme high weight favour detection helium line low weight associate non-detection idea correlate ionization eldwim surround hii region
