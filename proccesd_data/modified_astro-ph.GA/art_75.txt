 nls galaxy estimation central black hole mass x-ray excess variance method black hole mass determination active galaxy key issue understand various luminosity state present paper try generalise mass determination method base x-ray excess variance successfully use typical broad line seyfert galaxy bls narrow line seyfert nls galaxy nls galaxy differ bls respect several property generally variable kev energy band natural expectation need use different scale coefficient mass variance two type source however find simple approach enough although majority nls galaxy sample single scaling coefficient large factor provide u satisfactory method mass determination small subset nls galaxy approach fail variability object appear intermediate level nls bls galaxy exceptional nls galaxy much hard soft x-ray spectrum majority nls galaxy thus postulate division seyfert galaxy bls nls accord width hbeta line less generic accord soft x-ray slope
