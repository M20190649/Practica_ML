 sulfur chemistry modeling massive dense core main sulfur-bearing molecule ocs h c observe four high mass dense core w -mm ira ira ira goal put constraint relative evolutionary stage source compare observation time-dependent chemical modeling use chemical model nahoon compute gas-phase chemistry gas-grain interaction depletion evaporation mixing different chemical composition shell structure protostellar envelope include since observe line suggest nonthermal supersonic broadening observe radial profile temperature density use compute chemistry function time model underproduce cs several order magnitude compare s-bearing molecule seem contradict observation although uncertainty c abundance observe high temperature remain ocs h abundance ratio could theory use trace age massive protostars since show strong dependence time source close age compare accuracy chemical model observation comparison observation modeling may however indicate w -mm could chemically young three source turbulent diffusivity protostellar envelope less efficient e cm s- otherwise would smooth abundance profile would observe sulfur chemistry depend strongly physical condition case conclusion give relative age ira ira ira except close w -mm seem young source
