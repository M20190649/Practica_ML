 first acetic acid survey carma hot molecular core acetic acid ch cooh detect mainly hot molecular core distribution oxygen nitrogen n contain molecular specie co-spatial within telescope beam previous work presume similar core co-spatial n specie may indicator detect acetic acid however presumption hold high spatial resolution observation become available large n-containing molecule number detected acetic acid source still low observation need support postulate paper report first acetic acid survey conduct combined array research millimeter-wave astronomy carma mm wavelength towards g g iras successfully detect ch cooh via two transition toward g tentatively confirm detection toward ira a. determined column density ch cooh time cm abundance ratio ch cooh methyl formate hcooch time toward g toward ira determined column density ch cooh sim time cm abundance ratio ch cooh methyl formate hcooch sim time consistent abundance ratio determine toward hot core finally model know line emission passband determine physical condition region introduce new metric well reveal weak spectral feature blend strong line may near sigma detection limit
