 numerical model diffuse ionize gas galaxy i. synthetic spectrum thermally excite gas turbulent magnetic reconnection energy source aim aim work verify whether turbulent magnetic reconnection provide additional energy input require explain poorly understood ionization mechanism diffuse ionize gas dig galaxy observed emission line spectrum method use detailed non-lte radiative transfer code make use usual restrictive gaseous nebula approximation compute synthetic spectrum gas low density excitation gas via additional heating term energy balance well photoionization numerical value heating term derive three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic two-fluid plasma -- neutral-gas simulation compute energy dissipation rate dig typical condition result simulation show magnetic reconnection liberate enough energy fully partially ionize gas however synthetic spectrum purely thermally excite gas incompatible observed spectrum photoionization source must additionally present establish correct observed ionization balance gas
