 lack close binary among hot horizontal branch star globular cluster ngc recent investigation reveal surprising lack close binary among extreme horizontal branch ehb star globular cluster ngc variance analogous sdb field star another puzzle result concern derive spectroscopic mass ehb star present paper extend study ngc ngc twenty-one horizontal branch star ehbs ngc ehbs observe four consecutive night measure radial velocity variation temperature gravity helium abundance mean statistical analysis detect one ehb close binary candidate per cluster best estimate close binary ehb fraction f even low estimate binary fraction among field sdb star rule within confidence level small observed sample strong conclusion draw close ehb binary fraction ngc although best estimate rather low f discrepancy spectroscopic derive mass theoretical model observe ngc analysis ehb star show similar trend first time report clear trend surface helium abundance temperature result show deficiency close binary among ehb star confirm two possibly three globular cluster feature therefore peculiarity ngc analysis also prove strangely high spectroscopic mass among ehb star confirm least second cluster result confirm f could function age sdb star population find recent model problem reproduce observation
