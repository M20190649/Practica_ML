 black hole galactic density cusp -- i. radial orbit cusp bulge paper study distribution function arise naturally self-similar radial infall collisionless matter matter may think either star dark matter particle rigorous steady state assume system infinite describe universal distribution function give self-similar index steady logarithmic potential case exceptional yield familiar gaussian infinite system inverse-square density profile show subsequently time-dependent radial self-similar infall logarithmic case accurately describe fridmann polyachenko distribution function system case finite grow able embed central mass universal steady distribution iteration except case massless particle iteration yield logarithmic correction massless particle case require renormalization central mass central spherical mass may accurately embed fridmann polyachenko grow distribution however speculation give concern importance radial collisionless infall actual galaxy formation
