 disk destruction -creation magellanic cloud unlike satellite galaxy local group long lose gaseous disk magellanic cloud gas-rich dwarf galaxy most-likely first pericentric passage allow u study disk evolution small scale magellanic cloud show disk destruction -creation large magellanic cloud extended stellar disk reach least kpc radial scalelengths gaseous disk truncate kpc mainly due interaction hot gaseous halo milky way stellar disk small magellanic cloud hand essentially destroy old stellar population show sign rotation pressure support irregular elongated shape smc severely disturb close encounter lmc recent myr ago also strip large quantity gas create much magellanic stream magellanic bridge amazingly smc intact rotate hi disk indicate either inner hi preserve destruction likely hi disk reform quickly last close encounter lmc
