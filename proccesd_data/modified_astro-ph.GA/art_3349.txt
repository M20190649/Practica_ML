 characterize dynamical state star cluster snapshot spatial distribution determine distribution stellar surface density sigma model static dynamically evolve star cluster different morphology include radially smooth substructured cluster find sigma distribution degenerate sense many different cluster morphology smooth substructured produce similar cumulative distribution however use tandem measure structure q-parameter current spatial dynamical state star cluster infer effect cluster dynamic sigma distribution q-parameter investigate use n-body simulation find depend assumed initial condition sigma distribution rapidly evolve high low density less myr suggest sigma distribution use assess current density star form region provide little information initial density however sigma distribution use together q-parameter information amount substructure use proxy infer amount dynamical evolution take place substructure erase quickly dynamic disrupt binary star system planet well facilitate dynamical mass segregation therefore dynamical processing young star form region could still significant even without currently observe high density
