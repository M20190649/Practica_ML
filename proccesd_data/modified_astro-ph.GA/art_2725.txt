 starless starless core paper present result carma continuum spectral line observation dense core per-bolo although core previously classify starless find evidence outflow conclude per-bolo actually embedded low-luminosity protostar discuss impact newly discover low-luminosity embedded object perseus molecular cloud starless core protostar lifetime estimate starless core lifetime overestimate class protostellar lifetime underestimate give relatively large systematic uncertainty involve calculation variation order significantly change either core lifetime expected protostellar luminosity function finally suggest high resolution sub millimeter survey known core lack near-infrared mid-infrared emission necessary make accurate census starless core
