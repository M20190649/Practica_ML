 dynamical evolution star form region model dynamical evolution star form region wide range initial property follow evolution region substructure use q-parameter search dynamical mass segregation use lambda msr technique also quantify evolution local density around star function mass use sigma ldr method amount dynamical mass segregation measure lambda msr generally significant subvirial virialised substructured region usually evolve form bound cluster sigma ldr method show massive star attain high local density median value region even supervirial evolve form unbound association also introduce q-sigma ldr plot describe evolution spatial structure function mass-weighted local density star form region initially dense star pc bound region always q sigma ldr myr whereas dense unbound region always q sigma ldr myr less dense region star pc usually exhibit sigma ldr value relatively high local density around massive star arise purely dynamic q-sigma ldr plot use estimate initial density star form region
