 tidal stability giant molecular cloud large magellanic cloud star formation occur onset gravitational collapse inside giant molecular cloud however condition initiate cloud collapse regulate star formation process remain poorly understood local process turbulence magnetic field act promote prevent collapse large scale galactic potential also influence cloud stability traditionally assess tidal shear effect paper examine stability giant molecular cloud gmcs large magellanic cloud lmc shear galactic tide use co data magellanic mopra assessment magma rotation curve data literature calculate tidal acceleration experience individual gmcs determine minimum cloud mass require tidal stability also calculate shear parameter measure clouds susceptibility disruption via shear force galactic disk examine whether correlation property star forming activity gmcs stability shear tidal disruption find gmcs approximate tidal balance lmc shear unlikely affect evolution gmcs mass close minimal stable mass tidal disruption unusual term mass location co brightness note gmcs large velocity dispersion tend sensitive tidal instability also note gmcs small radius represent majority sample tend strongly resist tidal shear disruption result demonstrate star formation lmc inhibit tidal shear instability
