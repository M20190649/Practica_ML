 grain surface reaction molecular cloud effect cosmic ray quantum tunnel grain-surface reaction play essential role interstellar chemistry since dust grain catalysis reaction surface allow formation molecule use chemical model gas-phase grain-surface reaction occur study particularly diffusion mechanism surface grain surface reaction occur via thermal hop specie cross potential barrier via quantum tunnel specie cross barrier show thermal diffusion hopping much efficient cosmic ray particle collides dust grain heat peak temperature k. present result numerical simulation include quantum tunnel mechanism specie h h consider effect cosmic ray particle collision surface reaction consequence gas-phase grain-surface abundance affected show complex molecule form molecular cloud
