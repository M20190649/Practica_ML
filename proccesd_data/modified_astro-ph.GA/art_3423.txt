 clumpy stream smooth dark halo case palomar mean direct n-body simulation simplify numerical model study formation characteristic tidal tail around palomar along orbit milky way potential unlike previous finding able reproduce substructure observe stellar stream cluster without include lumpiness dark matter halo show overdensities similar observe palomar reproduce epicyclic motion star along tail i.e simple local accumulation orbit star escape cluster similar position velocity process able form stellar clump distance several kiloparsecs cluster phenomenon confine inner part palomar 's tail previously suggest model reproduce density contrast clump surrounding tail find observed stream without include lumpiness dark halo suggest new upper limit granularity
