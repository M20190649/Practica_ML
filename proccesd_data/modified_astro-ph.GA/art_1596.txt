 density power spectrum turbulent thermally bi-stable flow paper numerically study behavior density power spectrum turbulent thermally bistable flow analyze set five three-dimensional simulation turbulence randomly drive fourier space fixed wave-number different mach number respect warm medium range density power spectrum become shallow increase true column density power spectrum trend interpret consequence simultaneous turbulent compression thermal instability generate density fluctuation weakening thermal pressure force diffuse gas behavior consistent fact observationally determine spectra exhibit different slope different region value spectral index result simulation consistent observational value also explore behavior velocity power spectrum become steep increase spectral index go value much shallow kolmogorov one value steep kolmogorov one
