 wide profile drift pulsar elegant way probe pulsar magnetosphere present result study wide profile pulsar use high sensitivity multifrequency observation gmrt since line sight sample large region polar cap case wide profile pulsar presence simultaneous multiple drift region quite probable see psr b psr b solve aliasing problem psr b use observed phase relationship drift region determine pattern rotation period p make fast known carousel find pulsar show drift multiple ring emission drift pattern ring phase lock constraint theoretical model pulsar emission favor pan magnetospeheric radiation mechanism
