 star formation molecular cloud star formation one least understood process cosmic evolution difficult formulate general theory star formation part wide range physical process involve interstellar gas star form supersonically turbulent plasma govern magnetohydrodynamics hard enough since understand even subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence well let alone supersonic non-ideal mhd turbulence however behavior star-forming cloud ism also obviously influence gravity add complexity continuum line radiative process finally behavior star-forming cloud influence wide variety chemical process include formation destruction molecule dust grain change thermodynamic behavior gas change ionization state alter strongly gas couple magnetic field result complexity nothing like generally agreed-upon theory star formation stellar structure instead force take much phenomenological approach note provide introduction current thinking star formation work
