 galactic nucleus formation via globular cluster merge preliminary result present fully self-consistent n-body simulation sample four massive globular cluster close interaction within central region galaxy n-body representation n x particle total cluster galaxy allow include natural self-consistent way dynamical friction tidal interaction result confirm decay merging globulars viable scenario formation accretion compact nuclear cluster specifically frictional orbital decay time faster predict generalized chandrasekhar formula ii progenitor cluster merge less galactic core-crossing time iii nc configuration keep quasi-stable least within galactic core-crossing time
