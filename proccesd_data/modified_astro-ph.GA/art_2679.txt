 assembly halo system milky way reveal sdss segue -- cemp star connection recent year massive new spectroscopic data set half million stellar spectrum obtain course sd particular sub-survey segue provide quantitative detail require formulate coherent story assembly evolution milky way disk halo system galaxy show complex interesting previously think concentrate halo system milky way new data sd segue reveal halo system comprise least two component inner halo outer halo demonstrably different characteristic metallicity distribution density distribution kinematics etc addition suggest new way examine data inner outer halo dichotomy enable understanding least one long-standing observational result increase fraction carbon-enhanced metal-poor cemp star decrease metallicity
