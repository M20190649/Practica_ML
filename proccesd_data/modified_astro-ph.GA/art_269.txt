 hydrodynamical simulation galactic fountain ii evolution multiple fountain use hydrodynamical simulation study detail fountain flow dependence several factor galactic rotation distance galactic center presence hot gaseous halo consider observed size-frequency distribution young stellar cluster within galaxy order appropriately fuel multiple fountains simulation present work confirm localized nature fountain flow freshly eject metal tend fall back close galactocentric region deliver therefore fountain change significantly radial profile disk chemical abundance multiple fountains simulation also allow consistently calculate feedback star formation halo gas finally also consider possibility mass infall intergalactic medium interaction cloud form fountain though simulation suitable reproduce slow rotational pattern typically observe halo around disk galaxy indicate presence external gas infall may help slow rotation gas cloud thus amount angular momentum transfer coronal gas previously suggest literature
