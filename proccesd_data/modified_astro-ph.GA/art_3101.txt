 structure dynamical condensation front interstellar medium paper investigate structure condensation front warm diffuse gas cold neutral medium cnm plane parallel geometry solution two parameter pressure cnm mass flux across transition front range much wide previously think first consider pressure range three phase cnm unstable phase warm neutral medium coexist pressure equilibrium wide range mass flux find solution connect cnm unstable phase moreover find solution large pressure range one thermal equilibrium state cnm solution realize shock-compressed region promise site molecular cloud formation also find remarkable property solution heat conduction become less important increase mass flux thickness transition layer characterize cool length instead field length
