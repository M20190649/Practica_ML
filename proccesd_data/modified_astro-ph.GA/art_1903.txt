 star cluster collision formation scenario extended globular cluster scl-de gc recent observation dwarf elliptical galaxy scl-de sc sculptor group galaxy reveal extended globular cluster scl-de gc exhibit extremely large core radius pc author discovery paper speculate whether object could reside dark matter halo might form merging two star cluster paper present n-body simulation explore thoroughly particular formation scenario follow merger two star cluster within dark matter halo range mass well absence dark matter halo order obtain remnant resemble observed extended star cluster find star formation efficiency quite high around per cent dark matter halo present low mass i.e raise mass light ratio object within body stellar distribution factor also find expansion single star cluster follow mass loss provide another viable formation path finally show future measurement velocity dispersion system may able distinguish various scenario explore
