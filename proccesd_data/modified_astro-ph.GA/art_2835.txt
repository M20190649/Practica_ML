 double pulsar eclipse phenomenology multi-frequency analysis double pulsar psr j b display short eclipse arise around conjunction radio wave emit pulsar absorb propagate magnetosphere companion pulsar b. eclipse offer unique opportunity probe directly magnetospheric structure plasma property pulsar b. perform comprehensive analysis eclipse phenomenology use multi-frequency radio observation obtain green bank telescope characterize periodic flux modulation previously discover mhz mclaughlin et al. investigate radio frequency dependence duration depth eclipse base weak radio frequency evolution conclude plasma pulsar b 's magnetosphere require large multiplicity factor also find expect flux modulation present radio frequency eclipse detect complex behavior consistent confinement absorb plasma dipolar magnetic field pulsar b suggest lyutikov thompson geometric connection explain observed periodicity harmonically relate pulsar b 's spin frequency observe eclipse require sharp transition region beyond plasma density drop abruptly region define plasmasphere would well inside magnetospheric boundary undisturbed pulsar also two time small expect standoff radius calculate use balance wind pressure pulsar nominally estimate magnetic pressure pulsar b
