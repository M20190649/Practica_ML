 non-isothermal filament equilibrium physical property so-called ostriker isothermal filament ostriker classically use benchmark interpret stability filament observe nearby cloud however recent continuum study show internal structure filament depart isothermality typically exhibit radially increase temperature gradient presence internal temperature gradient within filament suggest equilibrium configuration object therefore revisit main goal work theoretically explore equilibrium structure filament change non-isothermal configuration solve hydrostatic equilibrium equation assume temperature gradient similar derive observation obtain new set equilibrium solution non-isothermal filament linear asymptotically constant temperature gradient result show sufficiently large internal temperature gradient non-isothermal filament could present significantly large mass per unit length shallow density profile isothermal filament without collapse gravity conclude filament reach equilibrium configuration non-isothermal condition detailed study internal mass distribution temperature gradient within filament need order judge physical state filament
