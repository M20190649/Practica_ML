 study major merger use multi-phase ism code galaxy interaction common phenomenon cluster galaxy especially major merger particular importance change morphological type galaxy impact mass function galaxy trigger star formation main driver galactic matter cycle therefore conduct study major merger mean multi-phase ism code code base tree-sph-code combine sticky particle method allow star formation control property multi-phase ism contrast usually implement schmidt law depend mainly gas density previously code use isolated galaxy since star formation recipe restrict special type galaxy interest apply interact galaxy study major merger include research global property interacting system namely star formation rate star formation efficiency evaporation condensation rate well mass exchange distinct component namely star diffuse ism cloud investigate property provide insight interrelation various physical process result indicate star formation efficiency well evaporation condensation rate influence interaction
