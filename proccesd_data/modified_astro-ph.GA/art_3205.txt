 pulsar distance measurement uncertainty accurate distance pulsar use variety study galaxy electron content however distance measure pulsar derive absorption lack thereof pulsar emission galactic hi gas typically imply upper low limit pulsar distance available present critical analysis measure hi distance limit pulsar neutron star translate limit actual distance estimate likelihood analysis simultaneously correct statistical bias also apply analysis parallax measurement pulsar order obtain accurate distance estimate find parallax hi distance measurement bias different way difference sampled population parallax measurement typically underestimate pulsar 's distance limited distance technique work consequential strong effect galactic pulsar distribution i.e original lutz-kelker bias hi distance limit however luminosity bias dominate lutz-kelker effect lead overestimate distance bright pulsar technique applicable likely nearby give brightness
