 synchrotron constraint hybrid cosmic-ray thermally-driven galactic wind cosmic ray magnetic field substantially impact launching large-scale galactic wind many researcher investigate role cosmic ray group previously show cosmic-ray thermally-driven wind could explain soft x-ray emission towards center galaxy paper calculate synchrotron emission original wind model compare observation synchrotron data show early assumption launching condition wind must change require improve early model restrict launch region domain inner molecular ring decrease magnetic field strength previously assume maximum strength physically-motived modification find wind model fit radio synchrotron x-ray emission although model require high gas pressure density previous model order reproduce observed x-ray emission measure within small footprint drop magnetic field also decrease effect cosmic-ray heating require high temperature base wind previous model
