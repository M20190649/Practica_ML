 gravitational interaction globular open cluster introduction historically assume globular open cluster never interact however recent evidence suggest globular cluster pass disk may able perturb giant molecular cloud gmcs trigger formation open cluster old open cluster may link accreted globulars explore existence possible dynamical connection globular open cluster realize obvious link must form gravitational interaction open cluster bear gmcs move similar orbit accept globulars interact gmcs trigger star formation follow globular open cluster must also interact consistently theoretical argument well observational evidence show globular open cluster certainly interact population interaction far common usually think especially object part bulge disk monte carlo calculation confirm conclusion globular cluster seem capable induce formation open cluster often demise relatively frequent high speed cluster encounter cluster harassment may also cause long-term slow erosion tidal truncation globulars involve disputed object fsr mass-gc may statistically speak best example ongoing interaction
