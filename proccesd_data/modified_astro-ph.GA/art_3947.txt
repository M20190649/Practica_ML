 trace relativistic milky way within ramod measurement protocol advancement astronomical observation technical instrumentation implies take account general relativistic effect due gravitational field encounter light propagate star observer therefore data exploitation gaia-like space astrometric mission esa launch require fully relativistic interpretation inverse ray-tracing problem namely development highly accurate astrometric model accordance geometrical environment affect light propagation precept theory measurement could open new rendition stellar distance proper motion even alternative detection perspective many subtle relativistic effect suffer light propagate subsequently record physical measurement
