 identify compact symmetric object vlba imaging polarization survey compact symmetric object csos small less kpc radio source symmetric double lobe jet dominant theory small size object young radio source could grow large radio galaxy currently small population known csos make difficult definitively determine whether case great number gigahertz peak source identify sift spectral survey yield none dynamic source also bring quasar sample although interesting peak around gigahertz different reason use ghz vlba imaging polarization survey vips identify cso candidate morphologically follow source multifrequency vlba observation confirm cso identification study dynamic identification candidate within survey discuss well preliminary result follow-up observation
