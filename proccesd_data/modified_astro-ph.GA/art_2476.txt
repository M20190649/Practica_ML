 dry merger size evolution early-type galaxy dry i.e dissipationless merging propose main driver observed size evolution early-type galaxy etgs actual role mechanism question tightness local stellar mass-size relation etgs combine observe scaling law simple merging model bracket cosmologically motivated merging history draw following conclusion local massive etgs assemble stellar mass via dry merger extreme fine tuning require case
