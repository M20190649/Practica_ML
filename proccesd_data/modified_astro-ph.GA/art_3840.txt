 water star-forming region herschel wish iv survey low-j h line profile toward high-mass protostars understand origin water line emission absorption high-mass star formation decompose high-resolution herschel-hifi line spectra toward high-mass star-forming region three distinct physical component protostellar envelope usually see narrow absorption emission h ghz ground-state line h ghz excited-state line h o- ghz ground-state line broader feature due outflow usually see absorption h ghz line ghz emission see h o- indicate low column density high excitation temperature h ghz spectrum show narrow absorption foreground cloud along line sight low column density low excitation temperature although h ortho para ratio close intensity h ghz line show significant trend luminosity mass age contrast ghz line flux increase luminosity h o- line flux decrease mass furthermore appearance envelope absorption ghz h o- line seem sign early evolutionary stage conclude ground state transition h trace outer part envelope effect star formation mostly noticeable outflow wing line heavily affect absorption line ratio h involve ground state must treat caution average h abundance high-mass protostellar envelope change much time ghz line appear good tracer mean weight dust temperature source may explain readily see distant galaxy
