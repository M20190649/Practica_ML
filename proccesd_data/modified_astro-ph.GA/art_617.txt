 warp bar external tidal torque tumble dark halo dark matter halo lambda cdm cosmological simulation triaxial highly flatten many case triaxial equilibrium also tumble slowly typically short ax period order hubble time halo may therefore exert slowly changing external torque spiral galaxy affect dynamical evolution interesting way examine effect external torque exert tumble quadrupolar tidal field evolution spiral galaxy use n-body simulation realistic disk galaxy model measure amplitude external quadrupole moment dark halo cosmological simulation use force disk galaxy model series n-body experiment range pattern speed find torque strong enough induce long lived transient warp disk similar observe real spiral also induce bar instability later time galaxy model otherwise stable long period time isolation also observe forced spiral structure near edge disk normally self-gravity weak responsible structure overlooked influence dark halo may well responsible many peculiar aspect disk galaxy dynamic
