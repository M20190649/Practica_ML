 analytical model x-shape magnetic field galactic halo external spiral galaxy see edge-on exhibit x-shape magnetic field halo whether halo galaxy also host x-shape magnetic field still open question would like provide necessary analytical tool test hypothesis x-shape magnetic field galactic halo propose general method derive analytical model divergence-free magnetic field whose field line assign specific shape utilize method obtain four particular model x-shape magnetic field galactic halo passing also derive two particular model predominantly horizontal magnetic field galactic disk field model spiral field line spatially vary pitch angle four halo field model indeed lead x pattern synthetic synchrotron polarization map precise topology explain action wind blow outward galactic disk galactic center practice field model may use fitting purpose input various theoretical problem
