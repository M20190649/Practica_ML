 star solar neighbourhood form cluster cautionary note use distribution surface density bressert et al recently show surface density distribution low-mass young stellar object ysos solar neighbourhood approximately log-normal author conclude star formation process hierarchical small fraction star form dense star cluster show peak width density distribution also follow star form bound cluster significantly affect presence gas expand two-body relaxation peak surface density distribution simply obtain typical age myr cluster membership number hundred typify nearby star-forming region result depend weakly initial cluster size provide sufficiently dense initial half mass radius pc dynamical evolution important age myr conclude degeneracy yso surface density distribution complicate use diagnostic stellar formation environment
