 young stellar cluster rosette molecular cloud argument trigger star formation rosette complex well studied region galactic plane present apparent characteristic triggered star form region however still debate strong evidence corroborates statement focus characterize young stellar population rosette complex improve understanding process regulate star formation region propose original method rely joint analysis star color density near-infrared lead map molecular cloud spatial distribution detect embedded cluster characterization term member number age estimation identify cluster new discovery estimate total number young stellar object rosette range member find age distribution young cluster consistent general trigger scenario star formation molecular cloud study prove rosette complex evolution govern influence ob star population suggest simple morphological appearance active region sufficient conclude much trigger role star formation process method constrain cluster property use ukidss wise data prove efficient study region galactic plane would definitely benefit approach
