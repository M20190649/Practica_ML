 hercules satellite stellar stream milky way halo investigate possibility recently discover hercules milky way satellite fact stellar stream formation thereby explain elongated shape axis ratio assumption hercules stellar stream star flow along orbit progenitor find orbit would recently bring system close enough milky way induce disruption transformation bound dwarf galaxy stellar stream application simple analytical technique tentative radial velocity gradient observe satellite provide tight constraint tangential velocity system v km galactic standard rest combine large receding velocity determined tangential velocity yield orbit small pericentric distance r peri kpc tidal disruption therefore valid scenario explain extreme shape hercules increase mean flattening dwarf galaxy one considers fainter system could therefore impact satellite bind stellar system dominate dark matter fact stellar stream formation shed star milky way 's stellar halo
