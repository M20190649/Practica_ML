 relaxation spherical system long-range interaction numerical investigation process relaxation system particle interact long-range force relevant many area physic obvious reason stellar dynamic much attention pay case r force law however recently interest alternative gravity emerge significant difference respect newtonian gravity find relaxation phenomenon begin explore matter use numerical model spherical shell interact r alpha force law obey superposition principle find virialization phase-mixing time depend exponent alpha small value alpha correspond long relaxation time similarly happen compare n-body simulation classical gravity modified newtonian dynamic
