 flare compact cloud g close encounter sgr compact gas cloud g predict reach pericenter orbit around super massive black hole smbh galaxy sagittarius sgr event give u rare opportunity observe interaction smbh gas around report result fully three-dimensional simulation evolution g first pericenter passage strong tidal force smbh stretch cloud along orbit compress strongly vertical direction result heating flare cloud bolometric luminosity reach maximum sim l odot flare easily observe near infrared
