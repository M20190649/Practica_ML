 low frequency observation radio nebula produce giant flare sgr december giant flare sgr produce radio nebula detectable week observe wide range radio frequency make total wsrt observation perform quasi simultaneously either two three frequency start january end january reobserved field april may facilitate accurate subtraction background source mhz find total intensity source low expect gmrt mhz mhz measurement inconsistent spectral index publish previously mhz flux density however consistent early result compelling evidence significant depolarization frequency however find polarization angle differ substantially high frequency low frequency polarimetry total intensity measurement provide number clue regard substructure radio nebula associate sgr general complete understanding similar event low frequency observation provide new insight physic radio source
