 robustness ammonia thermometer ammonia inversion line often use probe physical condition dense ism excitation temperature first two para metastable rotational level excellent probe gas kinetic temperature however calibration ammonia thermometer depend accuracy collisional rate h present new collisional rate ortho-nh para-nh colliding para-h j investigate effect new rate excitation ammonia scatter calculation employ new high accuracy potential energy surface compute coupled-cluster ccsd level basis set extrapolation procedure rate obtain transition involve ammonia level j kinetic temperature range k. find calibration curve ammonia thermometer -- relate observed excitation temperature first two para metastable level gas kinetic temperature -- change significantly new rate use thus calibration ammonia thermometer appear robust effect new rate excitation temperature inversion rotation-inversion transition also find small
