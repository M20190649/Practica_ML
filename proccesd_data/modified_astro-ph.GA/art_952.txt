 kelvin-helmholtz instability godunov sph numerical simulation non-linear development kelvin-helmholtz instability two different density layer perform particle-based method godunov sph develop inutsuka godunov sph describe kelvin-helmholtz instability even high density contrast standard sph show absence instability across density gradient agertz et al interaction dense blob hot ambient medium perform also godunov sph describe formation evolution finger due combination rayleigh-taylor richtmyer-meshkov kelvin-helmholtz instability blob test result coincides well result grid-based code inaccurate handling density gradient standard sph point direct reason absence instability unphysical force happen density gradient even pressure equilibrium repulse particle initial density discontinuity therefore initial perturbation damp gap form discontinuity unphysical force study term consistency numerical scheme contrary standard sph momentum equation godunov sph doesnt use particle approximation derive kernel convolution new lagrangian function new lagrangian function use godunov sph analogous real lagrangian function continuum momentum equation godunov sph much good linear consistency unphysical force greatly reduce compare standard sph high density contrast
