 constrain milky way potential use dynamical kinematic substructure present method constrain potential non-axisymmetric component galaxy use kinematics star solar neighborhood basic premise dynamical substructure phase-space i.e due bar spiral arm associate family periodic irregular orbit may easily identify orbital frequency space use observed position velocity star initial condition orbital integration variety gravitational potential compute characteristic frequency study structure present frequency map find distribution dynamical substructure velocity- frequency-space best preserve integration perform true gravitational potential
