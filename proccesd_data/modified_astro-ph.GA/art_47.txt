 two type magnetohydrodynamic sheath jet recent observation astrophysical jet emanate various galactic nucleus strongly suggest double layered structure spine-sheath structure likely common feature propose sheath jet structure form magnetohydrodynamically within valley magnetic pressure form peak due poloidal toroidal component centrifugal force act rotate sheath plasma balance hoop stress toroidal field poloidal field concentrate near polar axis maintain converging plasma flow toward jet region toroidal field develop outside jet cone owe poloidal current circulating jet situation set magnetohydrodynamic mhd equation allow two main type solution least region far footpoint first type solution describe jet marginally bound nature type realize jet temperature decrease like viral one neither pressure-gradient mhd force determined consistently completely overcome gravity even infinity second type realize isothermal situation gravity cancel exactly pressure-gradient force hence jet type accelerate purely mhd force suggest also two type correspond respectively jet type ii radio galaxy fanaroff-riley classification
