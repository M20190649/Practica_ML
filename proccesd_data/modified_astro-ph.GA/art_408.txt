 analysis shape interstellar extinction curve vi near-ir extinction law combine new hst ac observation exist data investigate wavelength dependence nir extinction previous study suggest power-law form universal value exponent although recent observation indicate significant sight line-to-sight line variability may exist show power-law model provide excellent fit nir extinction curve value power beta varies significantly sight line-to-sight line therefore seem universal nir extinction law possible instead find beta decrease r v v e b-v tends increase suggest nir extinction curve consider peculiar may fact typical different r v value show power law parameter depend wavelength interval use derive beta increase long wavelength include result imply extrapolate power law fit determine r v unreliable avoid problem adopt different functional form nir extinction new form mimic power law whose exponent increase wavelength free parameter fit curve longer wavelength baseline high precision produce r v value consistent independent estimate commonly use method estimate r v furthermore unlike power law model give r v 's independent wavelength interval use derive also suggest relation r v e k-v e b-v estimate r v finally use model extinction curve show extinction curve accord theoretical expectation
