 gyr life globular cluster ngc ngc two similar galactic globular cluster differ mainly surface brightness profile classic king-like profile whereas ngc concentrated profile often interpret post-core collapse cluster heggie giersz however find also post-core collapse cluster giersz heggie conclude main reason difference two surface brightness profile fluctuation conclusion reach basis monte carlo model however present letter verify similar fluctuation occur n-body model model initialise generate initial condition monte carlo model ngc simulated age gyr one follow gyr new model help clarify nature fluctuation nature semi-regular oscillation time scale order yr. influence dynamical role play primordial binary evolution core
