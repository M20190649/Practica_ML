 multifluid magnetohydrodynamic turbulent decay generally believe turbulence significant impact dynamic evolution molecular cloud star formation occur within non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effect know influence nature turbulence present result suite -cubed resolution simulation decay initially super-alfvenic supersonic fully multifluid mhd turbulence find ambipolar diffusion increase rate decay turbulence hall effect virtually impact decay kinetic energy fit power-law time exponent find fully multifluid mhd turbulence power spectrum density velocity magnetic field steepen significantly inclusion non-ideal term dominant reason steepening ambipolar diffusion hall effect play minimal role except short length scale create extra structure magnetic field interestingly find least resolution majority physic multifluid turbulence capture simply introduce fix time space resistive term induction equation without need full multifluid mhd treatment velocity dispersion also examine common previously publish result find power-law nature
