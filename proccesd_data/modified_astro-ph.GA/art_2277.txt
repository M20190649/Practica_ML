 formation galactic bulge two-component stellar disk explain cylindrical rotation vertical metallicity gradient recent observational study reveal galactic bulge cylindrical rotation steep vertical metallicity gradient adopt two representative model bulge formation thereby investigate whether two model explain observed cylindrical rotation vertical metallicity gradient self-consistent manner one pure disk scenario pd bulge form pure thin stellar disk spontaneous bar instability two-component disk scenario tcds bulge form disk compose thin thick disk bar instability numerical simulation show although pd reproduce cylindrical rotation show rather flat vertical metallicity gradient inconsistent observation derived flatter metallicity gradient due vertical mixing star different initial metallicities stellar bar result imply bulge simply form pure thin stellar disk hand bulge form two-component disk tcds explain observed cylindrical rotation vertical metallicity gradient galactic bulge reasonably well tcds metal-poor star high z vertical distance originate already dynamically hot thick disk strongly influence vertical mixing bar stay situ long timescales thus keep low metallicity high z consequently vertical metallicity gradient bulge compose initially thin thick disk star flattened even gradient thin disk flatten significantly bar tcds
