 n-body simulation test stability triaxial galaxy mond perform stability test triaxial model modified newtonian dynamic mond use n-body simulation triaxial model consider density vary r center r large radius total mass model varies msun msun represent mass scale dwarf medium-mass elliptical galaxy respectively deep mond quasi-newtonian gravity build triaxial galaxy model use schwarzschild technique evolve system keplerian dynamical time typical length scale kpc find system virial overheating quasi-equilibrium relaxation take approximately keplerian dynamical time kpc system change inertial kinetic energy less relaxation however central profile model flatten relaxation overall axis ratio change roughly within keplerian dynamical time kpc simulation find system stable reach equilibrium state
