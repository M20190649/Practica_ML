 super-star cluster versus ob association super star cluster mecl msol large stellar nursery local universe contain hundred thousand million young star within light year many system find external galaxy especially pair interact galaxy dwarf galaxy relatively disk galaxy like milky way show possible explanation difference presence shear normal spiral galaxy impede formation large dense super star cluster prefer formation loose ob association possibly less massive cluster center contrast interact galaxy dwarf galaxy region collapse without large-scale sense rotation lack rotational support allow giant cloud gas star concentrate single dense gravitationally bound system
