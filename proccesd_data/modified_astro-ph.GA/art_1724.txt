 density variance -- mach number relation supersonic isothermal turbulence examine relation density variance mean-square mach number supersonic isothermal turbulence assume several recent analytic model star formation process series calculation supersonic hydrodynamic turbulence drive use purely solenoidal fourier mode find standard relationship variance log density mach number square i.e. sigma ln rho rhobar ln b b good fit numerical result supersonic regime least mach similar previous determination low mach number direct measurement variance linear density find severely underestimated finite resolution effect possible infer linear density variance via assumption log-normality probability distribution function inferred relationship mach number consistent sigma rho rhobar b b however significantly shallow observational determination relationship taurus molecular cloud ic consistent b imply additional physic gravity important cloud turbulent driving ism contain significant compressive component magnetic field find change picture significantly general reduce measured variance thus worsen discrepancy observation
