 variance dust-to-metals ratio galaxy recent work demonstrate surprisingly small variation dust-to-metals ratio different environment correlation dust extinction density star naively one would interpret finding strong evidence cosmic dust produce mainly star observational evidence suggest significant variation dust-to-metals ratio metallicity demonstrate paper simple star-dust scenario problematic also sense require destruction dust interstellar medium e.g. due passage supernova shock must highly inefficient suggest model stellar dust production indeed efficient interstellar dust growth equally important act replenishment mechanism counteract effect dust destruction model appear resolve seemingly contradictive observation give ratio effective stellar dust metal yield universal thus may change one environment another depend metallicity
