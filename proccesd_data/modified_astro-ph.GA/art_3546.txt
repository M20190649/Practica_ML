 iram- line survey horsehead pdr ii first detection l-c h hydrocarbon cation present first detection l-c h hydrocarbon interstellar medium horsehead whisper project millimeter unbiased line survey two position namely photo-dissociation region pdr nearby shield core reveal consistent set eight unidentified line toward pdr position six detect signal-to-noise ratio two last one tentatively detect mostly noise appear frequency toward dense core locate less away simultaneously fit rotational centrifugal distortion constant linear rotor gaussian line shape locate eight predict frequency observed line accurately fit linear rotor model imply sigma ground electronic state deduced rotational constant value mhz close l-c h. thus associate line l-c h hydrocarbon cation enable u constrain chemistry small hydrocarbon rotational diagram use infer excitation temperature column density finally compare abundance result meudon pdr photochemical model
