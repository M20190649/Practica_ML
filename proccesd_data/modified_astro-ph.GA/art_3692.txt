 rethink globular cluster formation paper aim emphasize main hint constraint difficulty currently try understand globular cluster form along multiple stellar generation issue must regard intimately connect formation process thus topic address include required mass progenitor ii form new star environment already crowd previous stellar generation iii photometry spectroscopy appear suggest different formation process second generation star iv whether dilution pristine material may may necessary formation second generation v cluster multiple iron abundance different homogeneous finally vi special environmental condition may necessary formation globular cluster multiple stellar generation
