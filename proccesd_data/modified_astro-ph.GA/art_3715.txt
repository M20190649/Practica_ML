 observation anomalous microwave emission hii region brief review give summary observation anomalous microwave emission ame hii region ame detect vicinity hii region give difficulty measure accurate seds wide range frequency complex environment many detection require data confirm emit significant ame contribution optically thick free-free emission uchii region may also significant case ame emissivity define ratio ame brightness micron brightness comparable value observe high-latitude diffuse cirrus region significantly low others however value dependent dust temperature data high frequency ghz high resolution arcmin good require disentangle emission process complex region
