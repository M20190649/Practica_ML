 multiwavelength observation massive stellar cluster candidate galaxy galaxy appear richer young massive stellar cluster previously know due advance infrared survey uncover deeply embedded region star formation young massive cluster significantly impact surround interstellar medium ism hence radio observation also important tracer activity several hundred cluster candidate know examine survey data report multiwavelength observation six candidate galaxy carry ghz vla observation radio emission associate cluster obtain physical characteristic surround gas include lyman continuum photon flux ionize gas mass spitzer infrared array camera observation also make region provide detail stellar population well dust continuum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission compare know young massive cluster galaxy six cluster candidate less powerful lyman ionizing flux ionize less h ii mass surround ism therefore cluster candidate appear consistent intermediate-mass cluster msun
