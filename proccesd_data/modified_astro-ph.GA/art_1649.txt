 radial mixing due spiral-bar resonance overlap implication milky way recently identify previously unknown radial migration mechanism result overlap spiral bar resonance galactic disc minchev famaey minchev et al new mechanism much efficient mix transient spiral presence unavoidable barred galaxy milky way consequence strong flattening metallicity gradient disc extended disc profile formation thick disc component take place couple gyr timescale drastically short previously expect thus put strong constraint longevity strength pattern speed galactic bar spiral structure
