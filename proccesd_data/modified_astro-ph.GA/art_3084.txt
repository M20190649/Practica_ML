 map linearly polarized spectral line emission around evolved star irc present spectro-polarimetric observation several molecular line obtain submillimeter array sma toward carbon rich agb star irc detect map linear polarization co si cs line polarization arise distance au star blueshifted respect stokes i. si polarization pattern appear consistent locally radial magnetic field configuration however co cs line polarization suggest overall complex magnetic field morphology within envelope work demonstrate feasibility use spectro-polarimetric observation carry tomographic imaging magnetic field circumstellar envelope
