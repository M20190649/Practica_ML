 larson 's third law universality molecular cloud structure larson first note scale relation mass size molecular cloud imply object approximately constant column density original claim base upon millimeter observation carbon monoxide line challenge many theorist argue apparent constant column density observe merely result limited dynamic range observation reality cloud column density variation two order magnitude letter investigate set nearby molecular cloud near-infrared excess method guarantee large dynamic range robust column density measurement test validity larson 's third law verify different cloud almost identical average column density give extinction threshold hold regardless extinction threshold actual average surface mass density function specific threshold use show second version larson 's third law involve mass-radius relation single cloud core hold sample indicate individual cloud object describe constant column density result instead indicate molecular cloud characterize universal structure finally point universal structure link log-normal nature cloud column density distribution
