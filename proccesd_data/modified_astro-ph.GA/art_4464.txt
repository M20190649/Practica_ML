 quantitative chemical tagging stellar age chemo-dynamical evolution galactic disc early science result new generation high-resolution stellar spectroscopic survey galah gaia-eso survey represent major milestone quest chemically tag galaxy yet technique reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar group remain largely untested recently build previous work develop empirical chemical tag probability function describe likelihood two field star conatal form cluster environment work perform first ever blind chemical tag experiment i.e. tag star know otherwise discernable association sample disc field star number high quality high resolution homogeneous metal abundance measurement present evidence chemical tagging field star identify coeval group star yet group may represent distinct formation site e.g dissolved open cluster previously think result point several important conclusion among group find limit strictly chemical abundance space e.g stellar age kinematics color temperature surface gravity enhance detectability group also demonstrate addition role probe chemical enrichment kinematic history galactic disc chemical tagging represent powerful new stellar age determination technique
