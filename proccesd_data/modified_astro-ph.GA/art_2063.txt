 galactic fountain rotation disc-galaxy corona galaxy like milky way cold k gas eject disc stellar activity so-called galactic-fountain gas expect interact virial-temperature k gas corona associated transfer momentum cold hot gas important consequence dynamic gas phase quantify effect interaction use hydrodynamical simulation cold cloud travel hot medium different relative velocity main finding velocity threshold cloud corona km hot gas cease absorb momentum cold cloud follow disc galaxy like milky way static corona would rapidly accelerate corona expect rotate lag inner region km respect cold disc also show existence velocity threshold explain observed kinematics cold extra-planar gas
