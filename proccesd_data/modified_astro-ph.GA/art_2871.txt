 structure hi galactic disk simulation vs observation generate synthetic hi galactic plane survey spiral galaxy simulation include stellar feedback process compare model without feedback find increase scale height hi emission well agreement observation realistic spatial structure include supernova blown bubble synthetic data show hi self-absorption morphology similar see observation density temperature material responsible hi self-absorption consistent observationally determine value find weakly dependent absorption strength star formation efficiency
