 two-component jet simulation combine analytical numerical approach recent observation well theoretical study yso jet suggest presence two steady component disk wind type outflow need explain observed high mass loss rate stellar wind type outflow probably account observed stellar spin framework construct numerical two-component jet model properly mix analytical disk wind solution complementary analytically derive stellar outflow combination control spatial temporal parameter order address different physical condition time variable feature study temporal evolution interaction two jet component small large scale simulation reach steady state configuration close initial solution although time variability find considerably affect dynamic flow fluctuation generate condensation whose large scale structure strong resemblance observe yso jet knot
