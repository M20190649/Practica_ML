 distance g sagittarius spiral arm h maser trigonometric parallax vera report trigonometric parallax measurement galactic star form region g toward sagittarius spiral arm conduct multi-epoch phase-referencing observation h maser source g japanese vlbi array vera successfully detect parallax ma correspond source distance kpc less half kinematic distance g new distance measurement demonstrate sagittarius arm lie close distance kpc instead previously assume kpc kinematic distance previously suggest deviation sagittarius arm toward galactic center symmetrically fit model taylor cordes likely due large error kinematic distance low galactic longitude g likely trace near side sagittarius arm attempt fit pitch angle arm parallax measurement along arm yield two possible pitch angle degree degree proper motion measurement suggest g significant peculiar motion relative differential rotation galaxy assume circular orbit indicate source motion good agreement galactic rotation
