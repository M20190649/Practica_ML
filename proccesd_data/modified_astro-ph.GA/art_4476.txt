 use gas kinematics constrain model disk ic use deep longslit spectrum nearby edge galaxy ic obtain gas kinematics radial scale-lengths kpc vertical scale-heights kpc large vertical range span data offer unique leverage constrain three-dimensional model shape observed emission-line profile offer insight line-of-sight density distribution disk discuss possibility see disk-flaring ionized gas finally begin quantify measurement line shape allow model galaxy compare data across radius height simultaneously
