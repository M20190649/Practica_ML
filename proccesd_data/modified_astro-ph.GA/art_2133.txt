 bright end colour-magnitude relation investigate origin colour-magnitude relation cmr follow early-type cluster galaxy use combination cosmological n-body simulation cluster galaxy semi-analytic model galaxy formation lagos cora padilla result show good agreement general trend simulated observed cmr however many cluster luminous galaxy depart linear fit observe data display almost constant colour aim understand behaviour analyze dependence redshift stellar mass contribute galaxy different process i.e. quiescent star formation starburst major minor wet dry merger disk instability event evolution metallicity stellar component contribute process also investigate find major contribution stellar mass low redshift due minor dry merger event metallicity stellar mass accrete process quite low thus minor dry merger event seem increase mass luminous galaxy without change colour
