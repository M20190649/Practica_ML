 large eddy simulation supersonic turbulence base idea woodward et al. subgrid scale model applicable highly compressible turbulence present apply subgrid scale model large eddy simulation force supersonic turbulence bottleneck effect largely reduced thereby approximate scaling law obtain relatively low numerical resolution agreement previous result ppm simulation without explicit subgrid scale model find energy spectrum function velocity field fractional density-weighing rho u varies substantially forcing least decade wavenumbers next energy-containing range consequently universal scaling compressible turbulence exists find length scale much small force scale
