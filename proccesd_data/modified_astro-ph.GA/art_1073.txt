 mass-size relation cloud core i. new probe structure molecular cloud use new contour-based map analysis technique measure mass size molecular cloud fragment continuously wide range spatial scale r pc i.e. scale dense core entire cloud present paper present method via detailed exploration perseus molecular cloud dust extinction emission data combine yield reliable scale-dependent measurement mass scale-independent analysis approach useful several reason first provide comprehensive characterization map i.e. bias towards particular spatial scale lack bias extremely useful joint analysis many data set take different spatial resolution include comparison different cloud complex second multi-scale mass-size data constitute unique resource derive slope mass-size law via power-law fit slope provide singular constraint large-scale density gradient cloud
