 formation low-mass condensation molecular cloud core via thermal instability low-mass condensation lmcs observe within molecular cloud core research investigate effect isobaric thermal instability ti apply form lmcs purpose first investigate occurrence ti molecular cloud study significance linear isobaric ti use contracting axisymmetric cylindrical core axial magnetic field consideration cooling heating mechanism molecular cloud show include heating due ambipolar diffusion lead occurrence ti time-scale small dynamical time-scale application linear perturbation analysis show isobaric ti take place out region molecular cloud core furthermore result showthat perturbation wavelength great astronomical unit protect destabilization property thermal conduction grow form lmcs thus result show mechanism ti use explain formation lmcs progenitor collapse proto-stellar entity brown dwarf proto-planets
