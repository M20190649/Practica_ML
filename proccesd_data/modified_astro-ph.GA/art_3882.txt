 towards census galactic anticentre star cluster iii trace spiral structure outer disk paper investigate nature star cluster candidate project towards galactic anticentre derive fundamental parameter confirmed cluster among new identification four remain uncertain case require deep photometry establish nature probably field fluctuation addition provide partial census open cluster towards galactic anticentre also include study interesting object outside anticentre region second third galactic quadrant mainly perseus outer arm cluster confirm extension outer arm along third quadrant also point embedded cluster fsr distance kpc de sun project line sight local group irregular dwarf galaxy ic thus part unusual property ic may explain galactic contamination point importance embedded cluster trace spiral structure
