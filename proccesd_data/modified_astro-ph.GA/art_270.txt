 spiral structure milky way galaxy spiral structure milky way galaxy yet know hii region giant molecular cloud prominent spiral tracer collect spiral tracer data milky way literature namely hii region giant molecular cloud gmcs weight factor base excitation parameter hii region mass gmcs fit distribution tracer model two three four spiral-arms polynomial spiral arm distance tracer available stellar direct measurement estimate kinetically standard rotation curve brand blitz r kpc theta km newly fit rotation curve r kpc theta km r kpc theta km find two-arm logarithmic model fit data many region three- four-arm logarithmic model able connect tracer however least two observed tangential direction match three- four-arm model compose polynomial spiral arm model fit tracer distribution also match observe tangential direction use new rotation curve r kpc theta km r kpc theta km estimation kinematic distance find distribution hii region gmcs fit model well although result change significantly compare parameter standard r theta
