 estimation high-resolution dust column density map comparison modified black-body fit radiative transfer model sub-millimetre dust emission often use derive column density n dense interstellar cloud observation consist data several wavelength variable resolution examine two procedure propose estimation high resolution n map method use low-resolution temperature map combine high resolution intensity data method b combine n estimate different wavelength range aim determine accuracy method relative true column density estimate obtainable radiative transfer modelling use magnetohydrodynamical mhd simulation radiative transfer calculation simulate sub-millimetre observation wavelength herschel space observatory observation analyse method result compare true value result radiative transfer modelling observation method b give relatively reliable column density estimate resolution um data also make use long wavelength high signal-to-noise data result method b well correlate true column density method less sensitive noise cloud internal heating result method b consistent would obtain high-resolution data line-of-sight temperature variation underestimate true column density favourable cancellation error method sometimes give correct value radiative transfer modelling even simple cloud model provide good result however complexity model require improvement increase rapidly complexity opacity cloud
