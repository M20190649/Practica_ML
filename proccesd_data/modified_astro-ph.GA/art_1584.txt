 futile search galactic disk dark matter several approach use search dark matter galactic disk mixed result em maybe yes maybe prevailing approach integrate poisson-boltzmann equation tracer star lead definitive result em yes touchstone em yes analysis bahcall et al subsequently confirm refute various investigator motivation approach search different direction apply virial theorem extant data conclude vertical density profile disk state equilbrium therefore poisson-boltzmann approach inappropriate thereby lead indefensible conclusion
