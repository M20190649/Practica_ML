 black hole sub-systems idealized nuclear star cluster recent observational evidence numerical simulation theoretical argument seem indicate stellar mass black hole bh persist stellar system globular star cluster much long previously think previously theory imply bh would segregate compact system short dynamical time scale bh would escape long present stellar system exist state balanced evolution energy generate core regulate process two-body relaxation bulk system system centrally concentrated bh subsystem massive central bh energy generate three-body encounter core subsystem therefore balanced evolution evolution bh subsystem regulate much long time scale host system present paper implication result idealized nuclear star cluster nsc discuss though previous theory imply bh would almost absent many nsc -- relatively short dynamical time scale -- argue base result idealized model many nsc could still host substantial bh subsystem
