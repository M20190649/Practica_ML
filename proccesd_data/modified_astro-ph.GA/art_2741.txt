 detailed abundance giant two inner bulge field infrared spectroscopy report abundance analysis giant star two inner galactic bulge field l b deg l b deg base r infrared spectroscopy um use nirspec keck ii telescope find iron abundance fe h dex -sigma dispersion fe h dex -sigma dispersion l b l b deg field respectively agreement prior study find enhanced alpha fe dex confirm lack major vertical abundance composition gradient innermost pc baade 's window pc galactic plane also confirm known enhancement alpha element observe pc nucleus also present volume inner bulge may therefore presume general characteristic bulge bar star within kpc galactic center
