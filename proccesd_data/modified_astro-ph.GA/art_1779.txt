 analysis blue straggler population sgr dsph globular cluster arp present discuss new bvi ccd photometry field globular cluster arp consider member sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy main goal investigation study statistic spatial distribution blue straggler star cluster blue straggler star observe hot blue star luminosity environment appear much young rest stellar population two main channel suggest produce star collision star cluster mass transfer merger component primordial short-period binary spatial distribution star inside star cluster compare distribution star different evolutionary stage cast light efficient production mechanism work case arp find blue straggler star significantly concentrated main sequence star show degree concentration evolved star either red giant horizontal branch star since arp concentrated cluster suggest high central concentration indication blue straggler mostly primordial binary star
