 strange case ngc stellar population chemical composition dynamics year ago start observational campaign aim thorough study massive remote globular cluster ngc use collected data e.g. test alternative theory gravitation constrain stellar l ratio direct analysis observed luminosity function search dark matter within cluster present recent result peculiar abundance pattern observe sample cluster giant b newly find photometric evidence presence multiple population cluster particular new deep accurate uvi lbt photometry find color spread red giant branch significantly large observational error v-i u-v star lie blue rgb ridge line concentrated toward center cluster lie red ridge line
