 evidence bisymmetric spiral milky way context view point within galactic disc extremely difficult observe spiral structure milky way aim clarify structure galaxy re-examination gas distribution data mass determine stream membership among local star show relationship stream motion spiral structure method extend spiral pattern find neutral gas towards galactic centre use data mass select population local disc star complete kinematic data available plot eccentricity true anomaly stellar orbit identify stream dense region plot reconstruct spiral pattern replace star random position inward part orbit result find evidence mass bar length pm kpc angle pm degree extend spiral structure full turn toward galactic centre confirm milky way two-armed grand-design bisymmetric spiral pitch angle pm degree membership kinematic group assign local disc star see large majority local star orbit align spiral structure
