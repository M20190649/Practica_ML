 dust scatter turbulent medium correlation scattered light dust column density radiative transfer model spherical turbulent interstellar medium ism photon source situate center calculate investigate correlation scattered light dust column density medium model use fractional brownian motion structure appropriate turbulent ism correlation plot scattered light optical depth show substantial scatter deviation simple proportionality also find overall density contrast smooth scattered light word enhancement dust-scattered flux low-density region scattered flux suppress high-density region correlation become less significant scatter becomes closer isotropic medium become turbulent therefore scattered light observe near-infrared wavelength would show much weak correlation observation optical ultraviolet wavelength also find correlation plot scattered light two different wavelength show tight correlation scattered light versus optical depth
