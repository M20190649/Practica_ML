 correlation metallicity presence giant planet correlation stellar metallicity presence giant planet well establish tentatively explain possible increase planet formation probability stellar disk enhanced amount metal however two caveat explanation first giant star planet show metallicity distribution skew towards metal-rich object find dwarf second correlation metallicity valid intermediate metallicities show giant planet preferentially find orbit thick disk star none two peculiarity explain propose scenario giant planet formation contend galactic nature probably link formation process giant planet suggest dynamical effect namely migration star galactic disk origin feature important consequence metal-rich star host giant planet originate inner disk property largely neglect illustrate planet-metallicity correlation similar observed one easily obtain star inner disk high percentage giant planet star bear solar radius specific dependence metallicity propose density molecular hydrogen inner galactic disk molecular ring could play role set high percentage giant planet originate region
