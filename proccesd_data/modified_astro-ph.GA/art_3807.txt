 influence radial stellar migration chemical evolution milky way stellar migration important dynamical process galactic disk model radial stellar migration galactic disk analytical method add detail galactic chemical evolution model study influence radial stellar migration chemical evolution milky way especially abundance gradient find radial stellar migration galactic disk make profile g-dwarf metallicity distribution solar neighborhood taller narrower thus become another solution g-dwarf problem also scatter age-metallicity relation however migration abundance distribution along galactic radius n't change much namely abundance gradient would flatten radial stellar migration different prediction many theoretical work flatten radial gradient mean chemical abundance star old star possess flat abundance gradient young star significant effect radial stellar migration chemical abundance position scatter abundance star relatively concentrated value range
