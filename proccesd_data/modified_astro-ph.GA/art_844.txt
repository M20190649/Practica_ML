 ira magnetic tale two core present polarization observation dust continuum emission ira class protostar know least two component source b. measurement conduct submillimeter array sma frequency ghz high angular resolution arcsecond find large scale global direction field perpendicular observed polarization appear along dust ridge emission peak small scale find field structure significantly different two component binary first component source show magnetic field structure hourglass shape predict theoretical model low mass star formation presence strong magnetic field however component source b show relatively ordered magnetic field evidence deformation observed decrease polarization towards center calculation show ira magnetic energy strong turbulent energy approximately similar centrifugal energy result provide additional evidence show two protostars appear different stage evolution
