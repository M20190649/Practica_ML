 moment core collapse star cluster mass function star cluster multi-mass component dynamically evolve fast model equal-mass component use series direct n -body simulation investigate dynamical evolution star cluster mass function especially core collapse time multi-mass cluster tend behave like system small number particle call effective number particle n eff n eff max max total cluster mass mass massive star cluster respectively find time core collapse inversely proportional mass massive star cluster analytically confirm core collapse cluster mass function proceeds dynamical friction timescale massive star mass massive star increase however core-collapse time observe core bounce cluster core evolution core density core radius become ambiguous find case total binding energy hard binary give good diagnosis determine moment core collapse base result simulation argue core bounce become ambiguous mass massive star exceeds total mass cluster
