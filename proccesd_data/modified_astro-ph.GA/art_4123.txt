 time variation h radial gradient galactic disk base planetary nebula controversy time variation radial abundance gradient principle settle estimate gradient planetary nebula pn eject central star cspn different age work consider four sample cspn whose lifetime estimate use three different method estimate oxygen abundance gradient object result suggest small difference young old cspn young object similar slightly high oxygen abundance compare old object gradient group similar within uncertainty therefore h radial gradient change appreciably lifetime object consider pn gradient expect different gradient observe young object seem support recent observational data
