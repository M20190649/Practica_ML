 photometric identification blue horizontal branch star investigate performance common machine learn technique identify bhb star photometric data train machine learn algorithm use previously publish spectroscopic identification bhb star sd data investigate performance three different technique namely k near neighbour classification kernel density estimation support vector machine svm discuss performance method term completeness contamination discuss prospect trading value achieve low contamination expense low completeness adjust probability threshold classification also discuss role prior probability classification performance assess via simulation reliability dataset use training overall seem no-prior give best completeness adopt prior lower contamination find svm generally deliver low contamination give level completeness method choice finally classify large sample sdss dr photometry use svm train spectroscopic sample identify probable bhb star sample star derive photometric parallax demonstrate result reasonable compare know distance selection globular cluster attach classification include probability electronic table use either directly bhb star catalogue prior spectroscopic classification method also provide final model directly apply new data
