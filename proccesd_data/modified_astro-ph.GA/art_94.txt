 dynamically dominant magnetic field diffuse interstellar medium observation show magnetic field interstellar medium ism often respond increase gas density would naively expect frozen-in field may suggest magnetic field diffuse gas becomes detach dense cloud form investigate possibility use theoretical estimate simple magneto-hydrodynamic model flow without mass conservation numerical simulation thermally unstable flow result show significant magnetic flux shed dense cloud form diffuse ism leave behind magnetically dominate diffuse gas
