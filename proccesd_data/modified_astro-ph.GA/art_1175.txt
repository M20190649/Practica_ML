 synthetic hi observation simulated spiral galaxy use torus radiative transfer code produce synthetic observation cm neutral hydrogen line sph simulation spiral galaxy sph representation galaxy map onto amr grid ray trace method use calculate cm line emission line sight amr grid different velocity channel spatial pixel result synthetic spectral cube directly compare real observation compare synthetic spectral cube observation find good agreement whereby increase velocity channel trace main disc galaxy synthetic data also show kink velocity across spiral arm evidence non-circular velocity still present even blur data similar resolution observation largely absent indicate galaxy contain significant spiral shock thus detailed velocity structure map well represent previous observation grand design spiral
