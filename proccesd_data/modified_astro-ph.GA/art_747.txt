 mass distribution hickson compact group galaxy study present mass distribution sample late-type galaxy nine hickson compact group use rotation curve high resolution velocity field fabry-perot observation j-band photometry mass survey order determine dark halo visible matter distribution study compare two halo density profile isothermal core-like distribution cuspy one also compare visible dark matter distribution galaxy belong cluster field galaxy come two sample cluster galaxy barnes et al field galaxy spano et al central halo surface density find constant respect total absolute magnitude similar find isolated galaxy suggest halo density independent galaxy type environment find core-like density profile fit good rotation curve cuspy-like one major difference find field cluster compact group galaxy respect dark halo density profile
