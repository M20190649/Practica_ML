 astrometry galactic star-forming region g vera perform astrometry h maser galactic star-forming region g vlbi exploration radio astrometry vera derive trigonometric parallax micro correspond distance kpc distance g half far kinematic distance often assume previously distance place g sagittarius-carina arm near active star form region supernova remnant w also obtain three dimensional motion g find large peculiar motion km s. peculiar motion would originate multiple supernova explosion w streaming motion across sagittarius-carina arm
