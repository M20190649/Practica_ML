 efficient accurate extraction vivo calcium signal microendoscopic video data vivo calcium image microscope enable deep brain imaging previously inaccessible neuronal population within brain freely move subject however microendoscopic data suffer high level background fluorescence well increased potential overlap neuronal signal previous method fail identify neuron demixing temporal activity cellular signal often submerge large fluctuating background develop efficient method extract cellular signal minimal influence background model background two realistic component one model constant baseline slow trend pixel model fast fluctuation out-of-focus signal therefore constrain low spatial-frequency structure decomposition avoid cellular signal absorb background term subtract background approximate model use constrained nonnegative matrix factorization cnmf pnevmatikakis et al well demix neural signal get denoised deconvolved temporal activity validate method simulated experimental data show fast reliable high quality signal extraction wide variety image parameter
