 classification open close convex code five neuron neural code represent collection binary string encode neural activity show relationship among stimulus certain neuron call place cell show experimentally fire convex region space natural question ask neural code arise intersection pattern convex set past research establish several criterion complete condition convexity yet know code four neuron classify neural code five neuron convex non-convex code furthermore investigate code represent open versus close convex set interestingly find code open close convex code demonstrate minimal example phenomenon
