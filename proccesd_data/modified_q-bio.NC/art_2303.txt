 reconstruction sparse circuit use multi-neuronal excitation rescume one central problem neuroscience reconstruct synaptic connectivity neural circuit synapsis onto neuron probe sequentially stimulate potentially pre-synaptic neuron monitor membrane voltage post-synaptic neuron reconstruct large neural circuit use brute force approach rather time-consuming inefficient connectivity neural circuit sparse instead propose measure post-synaptic neuron 's voltage stimulate sequentially random subset multiple potentially pre-synaptic neuron reconstruct synaptic connection recorded voltage apply decoding algorithm recently develop compressive sensing compare brute force approach method promise significant time saving grow size circuit use computer simulation find optimal stimulation parameter explore feasibility reconstruction method realistic experimental condition include noise non-linear synaptic integration multineuronal stimulation allow reconstruct synaptic connectivity spike activity post-synaptic neuron even sub-threshold voltage unavailable use calcium indicator voltage-sensitive dye multi-electrode array one could monitor activity multiple postsynaptic neuron simultaneously thus map synaptic input parallel potentially reconstruct complete neural circuit
