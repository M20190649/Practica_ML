 electrical transient law neuronal microdomains base electro-diffusion current-voltage i-v conversion characterize physiology cellular microdomains reflect cellular communication excitability electrical transduction yet derive i-v law remain major challenge cellular microdomains due small size difficulty access voltage high nanometer precision present novel analytical relation derive different number ionic specie inside neuronal micro nano-domains dendritic spine steady-state current inject find large deviation classical ohm 's law show spine neck resistance insuficent characterize electrical property constricted spine neck model hyperboloid obtain new i-v law illustrate consequence narrow passage electrical conduction finally fast current transient local voltage modulate distance activate voltage-gated channel conclude electro-diffusion law use interpret voltage distribution neuronal microdomains
