 transient termination synaptically sustain spiking stochastic input pair coupled type neuron examine effect stochastic input current fire behavior two excitable neuron couple fast excitatory synapsis cell model typify quadratic integrate fire model mutual synaptic coupling cause sustained firing oscillatory behavior necessarily antiphase additive gaussian white noise transiently terminate oscillation hence destroy stable limit cycle application noise may return system spike activity particular noise range transition time oscillating resting state strongly asymmetric numerically investigate approximate basin attraction periodic orbit use markov process theory explain firing behavior term probability escape trajectory
