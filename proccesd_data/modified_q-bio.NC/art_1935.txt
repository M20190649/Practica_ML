 detection subthreshold pulse neuron channel noise neuron subject various kind noise addition synaptic noise stochastic opening closing ion channel represent intrinsic source noise affect signal processing property neuron paper study response stochastic hodgkin-huxley neuron transient input subthreshold pulse find average response time decrease variance increase amplitude channel noise increase case single pulse detection show channel noise enable one neuron detect subthreshold signal optimal membrane area channel noise intensity exists single neuron achieve optimal performance however detection ability single neuron limit large error test simple neuronal network enhance pulse detect ability neuron find dozen neuron perfectly detect subthreshold pulse phenomenon intrinsic stochastic resonance also find level single neuron level network network level detection ability network optimize number neuron comprise network
