 category specificity n response recovery speed face chinese character neural selectivity n response important phenomenon perceptual processing however recovery time neural selective response remain unclear present study use adaptation paradigm test recovery speed n response face chinese character result show recovery n response elicit face occur ms stimuli onset whereas recovery n response elicit chinese character occur ms stimuli onset result demonstrate category-specific recovery speed n response involve processing face chinese character
