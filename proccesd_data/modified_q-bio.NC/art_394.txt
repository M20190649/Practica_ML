 invisible stimulus implicit threshold invisibility judgment interpret isolation study unconscious cognition rely judgment participant state see critical stimulus e.g. masked-priming experiment trial participant give not-seen judgment treat critical stimulus subliminal unconscious oppose trial high visibility rating sometimes trial analyzed instance unconscious priming effect argue practice require implicit assumption subjective measure awareness incompatible basic model categorization uncertainty e.g. modern signal-detection threshold theory importantly ignore potential effect response bias instead take not-seen judgment literally would well employ parametric experiment stimulus visibility manipulate systematically accidentally would allow study qualitative double dissociation measure awareness stimulus process per se
