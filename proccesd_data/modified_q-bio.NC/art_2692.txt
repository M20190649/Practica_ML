 sampling-based causal inference cue combination neural implementation causal inference cue combination decide whether cue single cause multiple cause although bayesian causal inference model explain problem causal inference cue combination successfully causal inference cue combination could implement neural circuit unclear exist method base calculate log posterior ratio variable elimination problem unrealistic task-specific paper take advantage special structure bayesian causal inference model propose hierarchical inference algorithm base importance sampling simple neural circuit design implement propose inference algorithm theoretical analysis experimental result demonstrate algorithm converges accurate value sample size go infinite moreover neural circuit design easily generalize implement inference problem multi-stimuli cause inference same-different judgment
