 evolve network development neural system generally assume heterogeneity network nature probably arise via preferential attachment sort however origin various topological feature degree-degree correlation related characteristic often clear attribute specific functional requirement show possible analyse general scenario nodes gain lose edge accord e.g. nonlinear function local global degree information apply method two rather different example brain development -- synaptic pruning human neural network worm c. elegans -- find simple biologically motivated assumption lead good agreement experimental data particular many nontrivial topological feature worm 's brain arise naturally critical point
