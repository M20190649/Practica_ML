 regulation neuromodulator receptor efficacy implication whole-neuron synaptic plasticity membrane receptor neuromodulators nm highly regulate distribution efficacy phenomenon influence individual cell 's response central signal nm release even though nm receptor regulation implicate pharmacological action many drug also know influence various environmental factor functional consequence mode action well understood paper summarize relevant experimental evidence nm receptor regulation specifically dopamine receptor order explore significance neural synaptic plasticity identify relevant component nm receptor regulation receptor phosphorylation receptor trafficking sensitization second-messenger pathway gain study cultured cell key principle regulation control short-term plasticity sensitization identify model present employ direct indirect feedback regulation receptor efficacy also discuss long-term plasticity involve shift receptor sensitivity loss responsivity nm signal finally discuss implication nm receptor regulation model brain plasticity memorization emphasize realistic model brain plasticity go beyond hebbian model long-term potentiation depression plasticity distribution efficacy nm receptor may provide another important source functional plasticity implication learn memory
