 dynamic shift neuron excitability observe enveloped high frequency stimulation neuronal excitability know affect transcranial electrical stimulation however due existence excitatory inhibitory neuron cortex mechanism neuronal excitability shift still clear study electrical stimulation disturbance neuronal excitability neuromuscular system acute rat model design special stimulation waveform enveloped high frequency stimulation ehf modeling vivo measurement ehf confirm synchronize neuronal recruitment positive negative electrode unique synchronization property ehf amplifies electrical stimulation disturbance neuronal excitability enable macroscopic observation large increase decrease force output eliminate complicated inhibitory interneuron effect cortex observation neuromuscular system support argument electrical stimulation dynamically shifts neuronal excitability induce depolarization anodal stimulation hyperpolarization cathodal stimulation
