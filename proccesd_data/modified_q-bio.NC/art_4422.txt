 merlin mixture effect recovery linear network causal inference concern identification cause-effect relationship variable e.g establish whether stimulus affect activity certain brain region observed variable often constitute meaningful causal variable however linear combination need consider electroencephalographic study example one interested establish cause-effect relationship electrode signal observed variable rather cortical signal causal variable recover linear combination electrode signal introduce merlin mixture effect recovery linear network family causal inference algorithm implement novel mean construct causal variable non-causal variable demonstrate application eeg data basic merlin algorithm extend application different neuroimaging data modality give observed linear mixture algorithm recover causal variable linear effect another give variable merlin allow u recover cortical signal affect activity certain brain region direct effect stimulus python matlab implementation present algorithm available http github.com sweichwald merlin
