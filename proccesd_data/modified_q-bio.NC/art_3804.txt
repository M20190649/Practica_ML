 characterize self-developing biological neural network first step towards application compute system carbon nanotube often see alternative technology silicon transistor likely short-term one longer-term alternative study well contemplate biological neuron alternative component may seem preposterous first sight significant recent progress cmos-neuron interface suggest direction may unrealistic moreover biological neuron know self-assemble large network capable complex information processing task something yet achieve emerge technology first step design compute system top biological neuron build abstract model self-assembled biological neural network much like computer architect manipulate abstract model transistor circuit article propose first model structure biological neural network provide empirical evidence model match biological neural network find living organism exhibit small-world graph structure property commonly find many large self-organized system include biological neural network importantly extract simple local rule characteristic govern growth network enable development potentially large realistic biological neural network would need complex information processing computing task base model future work target understand evolution learn property network use build compute system
