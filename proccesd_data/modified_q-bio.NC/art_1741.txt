 topological analysis functional modeling case hippocampus topological data analysis rapidly turn key tool quantify large volume neurobiological data e.g. organize spike output large neuronal ensemble thus gain insight information produce various network discuss case several convergent topological analyse provide description data structure also produce insight data may process hippocampus -- -a brain part play key role learn memory result functional model provide unifying framework integrate spike information different timescales understand course spatial learning different level spatiotemporal granularity particular model allow quantify contribution various physiological phenomenon -- -brain wave synaptic strength synaptic architecture etc. spatial cognition
