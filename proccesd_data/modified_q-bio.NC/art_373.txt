 link dynamical functional property intrinsically burst neuron several study show burst neuron encode information number spike per burst stimulus varies length individual burst represent stimulus however vary substantially among different sensory modality different neuron goal paper determine kind stimulus feature encode burst length feature depend mathematical property underlie dynamical system show initiation termination burst trigger specific stimulus feature whose temporal characteristsics determine type bifurcation initiate terminate fire burst bifurcation possible restricted number encoded feature exist focus specifically describe parabolic square-wave elliptic burster find parabolic burster whose firing initiate terminate saddle-node bifurcation behave prototypical integrator firing trigger depolarize stimulus last long excitation prolong elliptic burster contrastingly constitute prototypical resonator since initiating terminate bifurcation possess well-defined oscillation time scale firing therefore trigger stimulus stretch match frequency terminate phase-inversion oscillation behavior square-wave burster somewhat intermediate since trigger fold bifurcation cycle well-defined frequency terminate homoclinic bifurcation lack oscillating time scale correspondence show stimulus selectivity determine type bifurcation also demonstrate additional biological property modify bifurcation structure play minor role stimulus encoding
