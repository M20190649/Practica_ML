 dynamical coupling structure pulse-coupled network maximum entropy analysis maximum entropy principle mep analysis non-zero effective interaction successfully characterize distribution dynamical state pulse-coupled network many experiment e.g. neuroscience well understand underlie mechanism find relation dynamical structure i.e. effective interaction mep analysis coupling structure pulse-coupled network understand sparse coupling structure could lead sparse coding effective interaction relation quantitatively display dynamical structure closely relate coupling structure
