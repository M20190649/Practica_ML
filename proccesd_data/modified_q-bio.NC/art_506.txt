 millisecond-scale motor encode cortical vocal area study motor control almost universally examined fire rate investigate brain shape behavior principle however neuron could encode information precise temporal patterning spike train well instead firing rate although importance spike timing demonstrate sensory system largely unknown whether time difference motor area could affect behavior test hypothesis significant information trial-by-trial variation behavior represent spike timing songbird vocal motor system find premotor neuron convey information via spike time far often via spike rate amount information convey millisecond timescale greatly exceed information available spike count result demonstrate information represent spike timing motor circuit suggest time variation evoke difference behavior
