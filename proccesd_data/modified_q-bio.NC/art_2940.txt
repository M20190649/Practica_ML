 solve -dimensional fokker-planck equation strongly correlate neuron pair neuron brain network often share much input receive neuron due essential non-linearities neuronal dynamic consequence correlation output spike train well understood strongly correlate regime consider two leaky integrate-and-fire neuron correlated white noise input analyze scenario use novel non-perturbative approach hence treatment cover weakly strongly correlate dynamic generalize previous result base linear response theory
