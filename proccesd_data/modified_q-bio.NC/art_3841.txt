 dynamical synapsis cause self-organized criticality neural network show network spike neuron exhibit robust self-organized criticality synaptic efficacy follow realistic dynamic derive analytical expression average coupling strength inter-spike interval demonstrate network dynamical synapsis exhibit critical avalanche dynamic wide range interaction parameter prove thermodynamical limit network become critical large enough couple parameter thereby explain experimental observation cortical neuron show avalanche activity total intensity fire event distribute power-law
