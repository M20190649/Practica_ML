 sparse convolutional coding neuronal ensemble identification cell ensemble originally propose donald hebb subset synchronously fire neuron propose explain basic fire behavior brain despite study many year conclusive evidence present yet existence involvement information processing identification still topic modern research especially since simultaneous recording large neuronal population become possible past three decade large recording pose challenge method allow identify individual neuron form cell ensemble time course activity inside vast amount spike record related work far focus identification purely simulta- neously fire neuron use technique principal component analysis paper propose new algorithm base sparse convolution cod also able find ensemble temporal structure application algorithm synthetically generated datasets show outperform previous work able accurately identify temporal cell ensemble even contain overlapping neuron strong background noise present
