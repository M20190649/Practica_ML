 cortical spike synchrony measure input familiarity spike synchrony occur various cortical area response specific perception action memory task spark long-standing debate nature temporal organization cortex one prominent view type synchrony facilitate binding grouping separate stimulus component argue instead general function measure prior probability incoming stimulus implement long-range horizontal intra-cortical connection show network kind -- pulse-coupled excitatory spike network noisy environment -- provide sufficient substrate stimulus-dependent spike synchrony allow quick spike estimate match input input history encode network structure give ubiquity small strongly excitatory subnetworks cortex thus propose many experimental observation spike synchrony view sign input pattern resemble long-term experience i.e pattern high prior probability
