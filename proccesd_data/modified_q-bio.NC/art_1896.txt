 frequency decomposition conditional granger causality application multivariate neural field potential data often useful multivariate time series analysis determine statistical causal relation different time series granger causality fundamental measure purpose yet traditional pairwise approach granger causality analysis may clearly distinguish direct causal influence one time series another indirect one act third time series order differentiate direct indirect granger causality conditional granger causality measure frequency domain derive base partition matrix technique simulation application neural field potential time series demonstrate validate method
