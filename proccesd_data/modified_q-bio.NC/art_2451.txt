 channel noise induce stochastic facilitation auditory brainstem neuron model neuronal membrane potential fluctuate stochastically due conductance change cause random transition open close state ion channel although previously show channel noise nontrivially affect neuronal dynamic unknown whether ion-channel noise strong enough act noise source hypothesised noise-enhanced information processing real neuronal system i.e 'stochastic facilitation demonstrate biophysical model channel noise give rise two kind recently discover stochastic facilitation effect hodgkin-huxley-like model auditory brainstem neuron first know slope-based stochastic resonance sbsr enable phasic neuron emit action potential encode slope input vary slowly relative key time-constants model second know inverse stochastic resonance isr occur tonically fire neuron small level noise inhibit tonic firing replace burst-like dynamic consistent previous work conclude channel noise provide significant variability fire dynamic even large number channel moreover result show possible associate computational benefit may occur due channel noise neuron auditory brainstem hold whether fire dynamic model phasic sbsr occur due channel noise tonic isr occur due channel noise
