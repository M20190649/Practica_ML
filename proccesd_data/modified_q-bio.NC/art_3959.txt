 inverse problem spin model several recent experiment biology study system compose several interact element example neuron network normally measurement describe collective behavior system even case would like characterize different part interact goal thesis extract information microscopic interaction function collective behavior two different case first study system describe generalized ising model find explicit formula coupling function correlation magnetization following study system describe hopfield model case find explicit formula infer pattern also analytical result allow one estimate much data necessary good inference
