 classification meaningful meaningless visual object graph similarity approach cognition involve dynamic reconfiguration functional brain network sub-second time scale precise tracking reconfigurations categorize visual object remain elusive use dense electroencephalography eeg data record name meaningful tool animal scrambled object healthy subject combine technique identify functional brain network recently develop algorithm estimate network similarity discriminate two category first show dynamic network category segment several brain network state time window consistent brain network reflect sequential information processing object representation reaction time second use network similarity algorithm result show high intra-category low inter-category value average accuracy obtain different brain network state
