 semiparametric energy-based probabilistic model probabilistic model define energy function probability state proportional exponential state 's negative energy paper consider generalization energy-based model probability state proportional arbitrary positive strictly decrease twice differentiable function state 's energy precise shape nonlinear map energy unnormalized probability learn data together parameter energy function case study show generalization fully visible boltzmann machine yield accurate model neural activity retinal ganglion cell attribute success model 's ability easily capture distribution whose probability span large dynamic range possible consequence latent variable globally couple system similar feature recently observe many datasets suggest new method wide applicability
