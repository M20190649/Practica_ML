 effect fast presynaptic noise attractor neural network study analytically numerically effect presynaptic noise transmission information attractor neural network noise occur short-time scale compare neuron dynamic produce short-time synaptic depression inspire recent neurobiological finding show synaptic strength may either increase decrease short-time scale depend presynaptic activity thus describe mechanism fast presynaptic noise enhance neural network sensitivity external stimulus reason general presynaptic noise induces nonequilibrium behavior consequently space fixed point qualitatively modify way system easily scape attractor result model show addition pattern recognition class identification categorization may relevant understanding brain complex task
