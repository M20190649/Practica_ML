 robustly represent uncertainty deep neural network sample deep neural network dnns apply increasingly challenge problem need able represent uncertainty model uncertainty one key feature bayesian method use bernoulli dropout sample prediction time recently propose efficient well perform variational inference method dnns however sample multiplicative noise base variational distribution investigate depth evaluate bayesian dnns train bernoulli gaussian multiplicative masking either unit dropout weight dropconnect test calibration probabilistic prediction bayesian convolutional neural network cnns mnist cifar- sample prediction time increase calibration dnns probabalistic prediction sample weight whether gaussian bernoulli lead robust representation uncertainty compare sample unit however use either gaussian bernoulli dropout lead increase test set classification accuracy base finding use bernoulli dropout gaussian dropconnect concurrently show approximate use spike-and-slab variational distribution without increase number learned parameter find spike-and-slab sampling high test set performance gaussian dropconnect robustly represent uncertainty compare bernoulli dropout
