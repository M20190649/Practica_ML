 stochastic resonance ensemble neuron transient spike train wavelet analysis use wavelet transformation wt analyze response ensemble n hodgkin-huxley hh neuron transient -pulse spike train independent gaussian noise cross-correlation input output signal express term wt expansion coefficient signal-to-noise ratio snr evaluate use denoising method within wt noise contribution extract output signal although response single n neuron sub-threshold transient signal noise quite unreliable transmission fidelity assess cross-correlation snr show much improve increase value n population neuron play indispensable role stochastic resonance sr transient spike input also show large-scale ensemble transmission fidelity supra-threshold transient spike significantly degrade weak noise responsible sr sub-threshold input
