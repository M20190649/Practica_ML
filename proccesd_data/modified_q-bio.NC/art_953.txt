 hierarchical network organization help retain comparable oscillation pattern rat human-sized brain activity coupled system often oscillatory example fire pattern neuronal population whereas oscillation study predominantly local circuit show topology large-scale network lead large feedback loop influence oscillation resting state find hierarchical modular organization neuronal network support distinct spectral pattern neural rhythm similar observe experimentally different specie rat human individual neuron multiple peak frequency non-integer ratio subsequent peak occur ratio occur model spatial size rat well human brain argue potential influence long connection thus long delay balance reduced number long-distance connection large brain network conclusion show hierarchical neuronal network provide scalable backbone multiple brain rhythm structural backbone could complement well-studied regional cellular mechanism generation prevention rhythm
