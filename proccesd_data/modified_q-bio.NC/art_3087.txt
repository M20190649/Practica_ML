 integrate-and-fire model generate spike train long-range dependence long-range dependence lrd observe variety phenomenon nature several year also spiking activity neuron often interpret originate non-markovian system show purely markovian integrate-and-fire model noisy slow adaptation term generate interspike interval isis appear lrd however proper analysis show case asymptotically comparison also consider new model individual neuron fractional non-markovian noise correlation spike train study prove lrd unlike classical model hand correctly measure long-range dependence usually necessary know data stationary thus methodology evaluate stationarity isi present apply various model explain markovian model may seem lrd non-stationarities
