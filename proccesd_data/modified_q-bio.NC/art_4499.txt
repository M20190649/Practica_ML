 sedmid confusion detection uncovering mind state time series brain wave data understand brain function intriguing topic year recent progress collect massive data develop advanced technology people become interested address challenge decode brain wave data meaningful mind state many machine learn model algorithms revisit develop especially one handle time series data nature brain wave however many time series model like hmm hidden state discrete space state space model hidden state continuous space work one source data handle different source information simultaneously paper propose extension state space model work different source information together learning inference algorithm apply model decode mind state student lecture base brain wave reach significant good result compare traditional method
