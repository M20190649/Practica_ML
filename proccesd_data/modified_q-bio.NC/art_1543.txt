 cod transient trajectory recurrent neural network follow stimulus neural response typically strongly varies time across neuron settle steady-state classical population cod theory disregard temporal dimension recent work argue trajectory transient activity particularly informative stimulus identity may form basis computation dynamic yet dynamical mechanism need generate population code base transient trajectory fully elucidate examine transient coding broad class high-dimensional linear network recurrently connect unit start review well-known result lead distinction two class network network input lead weak decay transient network specific input elicit strongly amplify transient response map onto orthogonal output state dynamic thesis two class simply distinguish base spectrum symmetric part connectivity matrix second class network sub-class non-normal network provide procedure identify transiently amplify input corresponding readout first apply result standard randomly-connected two-population network build minimal low-rank network robustly implement trajectory map specific input onto specific output state finally demonstrate capacity obtained network increase proportionally size
