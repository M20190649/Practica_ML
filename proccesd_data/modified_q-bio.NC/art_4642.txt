 compression-complexity measure integrated information quantify integrate information lead approach towards build fundamental theory consciousness integrate information theory iit gain attention regard due theoretically strong framework however face limitation current state dependence computationally expensive inability apply real brain data hand perturbational complexity index pci clinical measure distinguish different level consciousness though pci claim capture functional differentiation integration brain network similar iit link integrate information theory rather weak inspire two approach propose new measure phi c use novel compression-complexity perspective serve bridge two first time phi c found principle lossless data compression base complexity measure characterize dynamical complexity brain network phi c exhibit follow salient innovation mathematically well bound ii negligible current state dependence unlike phi iii integrated information measure compression-complexity rather infotheoretic quantity iv fast compute since number atomic bipartitions scale linearly number node network thus avoid combinatorial explosion computer simulation show phi c similar hierarchy phi several multiple-node network demonstrate rich interplay differentiation integration entropy node network phi c promising heuristic measure characterize quantity integrated information hence measure quantity consciousness large network like human brain provide opportunity test prediction brain complexity real neural data
