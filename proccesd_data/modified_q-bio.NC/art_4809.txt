 music brain music brain novel eeg sonification approach hear sound brain technique enable u hear neuro-electrical impulse originate different lobe brain answer question yes paper present novel method sonify electroencephalogram eeg data record rest state well influence simple acoustical stimulus tanpura drone tanpura drone simple yet complex acoustic feature generally use creation ambiance musical performance hence pilot project choose study correlation simple acoustic stimulus tanpura drone sonified eeg data till date study deal direct correlation bio-signal acoustic counterpart correlation vary influence different type stimulus first kind study bridge gap look direct correlation music signal eeg data use robust mathematical microscope call multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis mfdxa take eeg data participant min 'rest state i.e white noise min 'tanpura drone musical stimulus listen condition next eeg signal different electrode sonified mfdxa technique use assess degree correlation cross correlation coefficient tanpura signal eeg signal variation gamma x different lobe course experiment also provide major interest new information music stimulus ability engage several area brain significantly unlike stimulus engage specific domains
