 stimulus-dependent correlation population cod magnitude correlation stimulus-driven response pair neuron stimulus-dependent examine dependence impact information carry neural population stimulus drive stimulus-dependent change correlation carry information directly modulate information separately carry firing rate variance use fisher information quantify effect show although stimulus dependent correlation often carry little information directly modulatory effect overall information large particular stimulus-dependence correlation increase stimulus-induced firing rate significantly enhance information population structure correlation determine solely stimulus however presence additional strong spatial decay correlation stimulus-dependence may negative impact opposite relationship hold correlation decrease fire rate
