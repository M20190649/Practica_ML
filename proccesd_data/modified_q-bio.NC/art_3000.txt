 normalized neural representation natural odor olfactory system remove correlation natural odor use network inhibitory neuron olfactory bulb propose network integrate response olfactory receptor inhibit equally however global inhibition influence neural representation odor unclear study simple statistical model situation lead concentration-invariant sparse representation odor composition show inhibition strength tune obtain sparse representation still useful discriminate odor vary relative concentration size composition model reveal two generic consequence global inhibition odor many molecular specie difficult discriminate ii receptor array heterogeneous sensitivity perform badly work thus help understand global inhibition shape normalize odor representation processing brain
