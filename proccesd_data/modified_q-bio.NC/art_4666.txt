 multi-region neural representation novel model decode visual stimulus human brain multivariate pattern mvp classification hold enormous potential decode visual stimulus human brain employ task-based fmri data set wide range challenge mvp technique i.e decrease noise sparsity define effective region interest roi visualize result cost brain study overcome challenge paper propose novel model neural representation automatically detect active region visual stimulus utilize anatomical region visualize analyze functional activity therefore model provide opportunity neuroscientist ask question effect stimulus detected region instead study fluctuation voxels manually select roi moreover method introduces analyze snapshot brain image decrease sparsity rather use whole fmri time series new gaussian smoothing method propose remove noise voxels level roi propose method enable u combine different fmri data set reduce cost brain study experimental study visual category word consonant object nonsense photo confirm propose method achieve superior performance state-of-the-art method
