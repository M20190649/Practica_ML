 optimization leak conductance squid giant axon report theoretical study show leak conductance density gl squid giant axon appear optimal action potential firing frequency precisely standard assumption leak current compose chloride ion lead result experimental value gl close optimal value hodgkin-huxley model minimize absolute refractory period action potential thereby maximize maximum firing frequency stimulation sharp brief input current spike one end axon measured value gl also appear close optimal frequency repetitive firing cause constant current input one end axon especially temperature variation take account contrast leak current assume compose separate voltage-independent sodium potassium current optimization observe
