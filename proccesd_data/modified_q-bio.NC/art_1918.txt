 balanced memory network fundamental problem neuroscience understand working memory -- ability store information intermediate timescales like second -- implement realistic neuronal network likely candidate mechanism attractor network great deal effort go toward investigate theoretically yet despite almost quarter century intense work attractor network fully understood particular still two unanswered question first attractor network exhibit irregular firing observe experimentally work memory task second many memory store biologically realistic condition answer question study attractor neural network inhibition excitation balance use mean field analysis derive three-variable description attractor network description follow irregular firing exist number neuron involve memory large mean field analysis also show number memory store network scale number excitatory connection result suggest simple model never show realistic one prediction verify use simulation large network spike neuron
