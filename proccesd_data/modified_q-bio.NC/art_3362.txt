 optimize sequential decision drift-diffusion model make decision organism often accumulate information across multiple timescales however experimental model study decision-making focus sequence independent trial hand natural environment characterize long temporal correlation evidence use make present choice often relevant future decision understand decision-making condition analyze model ideal observer accumulates evidence freely make choice across sequence correlated trial use principle probabilistic inference show ideal observer incorporate information obtain one trial initial bias next bias decrease time accuracy next decision furthermore finite sequence trial rate reward maximize observer deliberate long early decision respond quickly towards end sequence model also explain experimentally observe pattern decision time choice thus provide mathematically principled foundation evidence-accumulation model sequential decision
