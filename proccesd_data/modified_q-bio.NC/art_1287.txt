 fitting dynamic recurrent neural network model sensory stimulus-response data present theoretical study aim model fit sensory neuron conventional neural network training approach applicable problem due lack continuous data although stimulus consider smooth time dependent variable associate response set neural spike timing roughly instant successive action potential peak amplitude information recurrent neural network model fit stimulus-response data pair use maximum likelihood estimation method likelihood function derive poisson statistic neural spiking universal approximation feature recurrent dynamical neuron network model allow u describe excitatory-inhibitory characteristic actual sensory neural network desired number neuron stimulus data generate phased cosine fourier series fix amplitude frequency randomly shot phase various value amplitude stimulus component size sample size apply order examine effect stimulus identification process result present tabular form end text
