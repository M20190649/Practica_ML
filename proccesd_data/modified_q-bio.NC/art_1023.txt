 neural sampling irregular gate inhibition spike neuron attractor network long tradition theoretical neuroscience cast sensory processing brain process infer maximally consistent interpretation imperfect sensory input recently show gamma-band inhibition enable neural attractor network approximately carry sampling mechanism paper propose novel neural network model base irregular gate inhibition show analytically implement monte-carlo markov chain mcmc sampler describe use model network neural attractor well single spike neuron finally show model apply spike neuron give rise new putative mechanism could use implement stochastic synaptic weight biological neural network neuromorphic hardware
