 multi-pulse phase reset curve paper introduce systematically study term phase response curve prc effect dual pulse excitation dynamic autonomous oscillator specifically test deviation linear summation phase advance two small perturbation derive analytically correction term generally appear oscillator whose intrinsic dimensionality great one demonstrate effect case stuart-landau model also various high dimensional neuronal model non-linear correction find proportional square perturbation deviation superposition principle need take account study network pulse-coupled oscillator deviation could use verification oscillator model via dual pulse excitation
