 reconstruction network structure repeat spike pattern simulated bursting dynamic repeat pattern spike sequence neuronal network propose useful reconstruction network topology reverberation physiologically realistic model various physical connection topology random scale-free simulate study effectiveness pattern-matching method reconstruction network topology network dynamic simulation result show functional network reconstruct repeat spike pattern quite different original physical network even global property degree distribution always recover however pattern-matching method effective identify hub network since form reverberation quite different network without hub form reverberation together reconstruction repeat spike pattern might provide reliable method detect hub neuronal culture
