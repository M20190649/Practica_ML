 intracellular impedance measurement reveal non-ohmic property extracellular medium around neuron electrical property extracellular space around neuron important understand genesis extracellular potential well localize neuronal activity extracellular recording however exact nature extracellular property still uncertain introduce method measure impedance tissue preserve intact cell-medium interface use whole-cell patch-clamp recording vivo vitro find neural tissue mark non-ohmic frequency-filtering property consistent resistive ohmic medium often assume contrast use traditional metal electrode provide different result consistent resistive medium amplitude phase profile measure impedance consistent contribution ionic diffusion also show impact frequency-filtering property possibly important genesis local field potential well cable property neuron present result show non-ohmic property extracellular medium around neuron suggest source estimation method well cable property neuron assume ohmic extracellular medium may need re-evaluated
