 emergence grid-like representation train recurrent neural network perform spatial localization decade research neural code underlie spatial navigation reveal diverse set neural response property entorhinal cortex ec mammalian brain contain rich set spatial correlate include grid cell encode space use tessellate pattern however mechanism functional significance spatial representation remain largely mysterious new way understand neural representation train recurrent neural network rnns perform navigation task arena base velocity input surprisingly find grid-like spatial response pattern emerge trained network along unit exhibit spatial correlate include border cell band-like cell different functional type neuron observe experimentally order emergence grid-like border cell also consistent observation developmental study together result suggest grid cell border cell others observe ec may natural solution represent space efficiently give predominant recurrent connection neural circuit
