 discrete flow posterior variational inference discrete dynamical system train step variational autoencoder vae require u sample approximate posterior usually choose simple e.g factorise approximate posterior sampling efficient computation fully exploit gpu parallelism however simple approximate posterior often insufficient eliminate statistical dependency posterior possible use normalizing flow approximate posterior continuous latents problem discrete latents strong statistical dependency natural approach model dependency autoregressive distribution sample distribution inherently sequential thus slow develop fast parallel sampling procedure autoregressive distribution base fixed-point iteration enable efficient accurate variational inference discrete state-space latent variable dynamical system optimize variational bound consider two way evaluate probability insert relaxed sample directly pmf discrete distribution convert continuous logistic latent variable interpret k-step fixed-point iteration normalizing flow find convert continuous latent variable give considerable additional scope mismatch true approximate posterior result biased inference thus use former approach use fast sampling procedure able realize benefit correlated posterior include accurate uncertainty estimate one cell accurate connectivity estimate multiple cell order magnitude less time
