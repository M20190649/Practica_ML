 human brain mapping base cold signal hemodynamic response electrical neuroimaging understand working human brain measurement relate brain function require measurement possibly non-invasive brain disturb less possible measurement integration various modality play vital role understand cognitive behavioral change human brain important source converge evidence specific aspect neural function dysfunction certain pathological condition focal change cortical blood flow tightly couple change neuronal activity constitute option map hemodynamic response infer principle cortical processing even complex task high temporal resolution eeg good spatial resolution nirs make concurrent measurement unique study spatio-temporal dynamic large scale neuronal network human brain integration two technique help overcome limitation specific method insensitivity electroencephalogram eeg unsynchronized neural event lack near infrared spectroscopy nirs low metabolic demand combination eeg nirs informative two separate analysis modality
