 control neural chaos synaptic noise study neural automaton -or neurobiologically inspire cellular automata- exhibit chaotic itinerancy among different store pattern memory consequence activity-dependent synaptic fluctuation continuously destabilize attractor induce irregular hopping possible attractor nature result irregularity depend dynamic detail namely intensity synaptic noise number site network synchronously update time step vary detail different regime occur regular chaotic absence external agent chaotic behavior may turn regular tune noise intensity argue similar mechanism might origin self-control chaos natural system
