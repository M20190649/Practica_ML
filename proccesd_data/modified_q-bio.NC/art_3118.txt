 object categorization finer level require high spatial frequency therefore take long human visual system contain hierarchical sequence module take part visual perception different level abstraction i.e. superordinate basic subordinate level one important question identify entry level visual representation commence process object recognition long time believe basic level advantage two others claim challenge recently use series psychophysics experiment base rapid presentation paradigm well two computational model bandpass filter image study processing order categorization level experiment investigate type visual information require categorize object level vary spatial frequency band input image result psychophysics experiment computational model consistent indicate different spatial frequency information different effect object categorization level absence high frequency information subordinate basic level categorization perform inaccurately superordinate level perform well mean low frequency information sufficient superordinate level basic subordinate level finer level require high frequency information appear take long process lead long reaction time finally avoid ceiling effect evaluate robustness result add different amount noise input image repeat experiment expect categorization accuracy decrease reaction time increase significantly trend same.this show result due ceiling effect
