 characterize signal encoding transmission class class ii neuron via ordinal time-series analysis neuron encode transmit information spike sequence however despite effort devote quantify information content little progress make regard use nonlinear method time-series analysis know ordinal analysis compare statistic spike sequence generate apply input signal neuronal model morris-lecar particular consider two different regime neuron lead two class excitability class frequency-current curve continuous class ii frequency-current curve discontinuous apply ordinal analysis sequence inter-spike-intervals isi goal investigate different neuron type generate spike sequence similar symbolic property get deep understanding effect electrical diffusive excitatory chemical i.e. excitatory synapse coupling compare small -- amplitude periodic signal apply one neuron signal feature amplitude frequency encode transmit generated isi sequence class class ii type neuron electrical chemical coupling find depend frequency specific combination neuron class coupling-type allow effective encoding effective transmission signal
