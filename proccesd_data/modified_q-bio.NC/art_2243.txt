 relation encode decode neuronal spike neural coding field study concern sensory information represent brain network neuron link external stimulus neural response study two parallel point view first neural encode refers mapping stimulus response primarily focus understand neuron respond wide variety stimulus construct model accurately describe stimulus-response relationship neural decoding hand refers reverse mapping response stimulus challenge reconstruct stimulus spike evoke since neuronal response stochastic one-to-one mapping stimulus neural response exist cause mismatch two viewpoint neural coding use two perspective investigate question rate coding simple setting single stationary stimulus parameter single stationary spike train represent renewal process show rate code define term encoding i.e. stimulus parameter map onto mean firing rate rate decoder give spike count sample mean always efficiently decode rate code improve efficiency read certain rate code correlation within spike train take account
