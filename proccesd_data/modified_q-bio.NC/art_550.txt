 explore spatiotemporal network transition task functional mri critical question cognitive neuroscience regard transition cognitive state emerge dynamic activity functional brain network however current methodology easily evaluate spatial temporal change brain network cognitive state combine simple data reorganization spatial ica enable spatiotemporal ica stica capture consistent evolution network onset offset task technique apply fmri datasets involve alternate rest task simple synthetic data start finish time-points period interest anchor define task block onset offset subject ten volume follow anchor extract concatenate spatially produce single sample sample anchor subject concatenate along fourth dimension dataset decompose use ica spatiotemporal component one component exhibit transition task onset default mode network dmn become less active fronto-parietal control network fpcn become active observe change relevance understand network dynamic e.g. dmn show change spatial distribution shift anterior superior pattern deactivation task posterior inferior pattern rest anchor analysis period associate onset offset task approach reveals novel aspect dynamic network activity accompany transition importantly finding observe without specify priori either spatial network task time course
