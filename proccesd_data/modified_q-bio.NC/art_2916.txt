 pairwise network information nonlinear correlation reconstruct structural connectivity interact unit observed activity challenge across many different discipline fundamental first step establish whether extent interaction unit consider pairwise thus model interaction network simple link correspond pairwise interaction principle determine compare maximum entropy give bivariate probability distribution true joint entropy many practical case option since bivariate distribution need may reliably estimate optimization computationally expensive present approach allow one use mutual information proxy bivariate distribution advantage less computationally expensive easy estimate achieve introduce novel entropy maximization scheme base condition entropy mutual information render approach typically superior method base linear approximation advantage propose method document use oscillator network resting-state human brain network generic relevant example
