 brain network module meaningful meaningless object network modularity key feature efficient information processing human brain information processing however dynamic network reconfigure short time period hundred millisecond require neuroimaging technique sufficient time resolution use dense electroencephalography eeg source connectivity method identify cortical network excellent time resolution order millisecond identify functional network picture name task two category visual stimulus present meaningful tool animal meaningless scrambled object paper report reconfiguration brain network modularity meaningful meaningless object result show mainly network meaningful object modular meaningless object network ventral visual pathway activate case however strong occipitotemporal functional connectivity appear meaningful object meaningless object believe approach give new insight dynamic behavior brain network fast information processing
