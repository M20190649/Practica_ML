 new framework euclidean summary statistic neural spike train space statistical analysis inference spike train one central topic neural coding great interest understand underlying structure give neural data base metric distance spike train recent investigation introduce notion average prototype spike train characterize template pattern neural activity however metric lack certain euclidean property define average nonunique share conventional property mean article propose new framework define mean spike train adopt euclidean-like metric l p family demonstrate new mean spike train properly represent average pattern conventional fashion effectively compute use theoretically-proven convergent procedure compare mean spike train average demonstrate superiority furthermore apply new framework recording rodent geniculate ganglion background firing activity common issue neural coding show propose mean spike train utilize remove background noise improve decode performance
