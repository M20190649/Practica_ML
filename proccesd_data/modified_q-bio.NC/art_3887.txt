 experimental demonstration associative memory memristive neural network someone mention name known person immediately recall face possibly many trait possess so-called associative memory ability correlate different memory fact event associative memory fundamental encompass human ability human network neuron brain must perform quite easily question whether electronic neural network electronic scheme act somewhat similarly human brain build perform type function although field neural network develop many year key element namely synapsis adjacent neuron lack satisfactory electronic representation reason passive circuit element able reproduce synapse behaviour need remember past dynamical history store continuous set state plastic accord pre-synaptic post-synaptic neuronal activity show accomplish memory-resistor memristor short particular use simple inexpensive off-the-shelf component build memristor emulator realize required synaptic property importantly demonstrate experimentally formation associative memory simple neural network consist three electronic neuron connect two memristor-emulator synapsis experimental demonstration open new possibility understanding neural process use memory device important step forward reproduce complex learning adaptive spontaneous behaviour electronic neural network
