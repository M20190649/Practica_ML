 decode multimodal behavior use time difference meg event multimodal behavior involves multiple processing station distribute across distant brain region understanding distributed processing coordinate brain limited take decoding approach problem aim quantify temporal aspect brain-wide neural activity may use infer specific multimodal behavior use high temporal resolution measurement meg detect burst activity hundred location across surface brain millisecond resolution compare decode use three characteristic neural activity burst decode event count latency time difference pair event train decoder regime particularly challenging number sample small order magnitude input dimensionality develop new decoding approach regime combine non-parametric model aggressive feature selection surprisingly find decode use time-differences base thousand region pair significantly accurate use activity characteristic reach accuracy consistently across subject result suggest relevant information multimodal brain function provide subtle time difference across remote brain area
