 tractography machine learning current state open challenge supervise machine learn ml algorithm recently propose alternative traditional tractography method order address weakness path-based local-model-free easily incorporate anatomical prior make contextual non-local decision help tracking process ml-based technique thus show promising reconstruction large spatial extent exist white matter bundle promise reconstruction less false positive promise robustness know position shape bias current tractography technique today none ml-based method show conclusive performance adopt de facto solution tractography one reason might lack well-defined extensive framework train evaluate compare method paper describe several datasets evaluation tool contain useful feature ml algorithm along various method propose recent year discuss strategy use evaluate compare method well shortcoming finally describe particular need ml tractography method discuss tangible solution future work
