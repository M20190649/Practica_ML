 episodic synchronization dynamically driven neuron examine response type ii excitable neuron train synaptic pulse function pulse frequency amplitude show resonant behavior characteristic type ii excitability already describe harmonic input also present pulsed input mind study response neuron pulse input train whose frequency vary continuously time observe receive neuron synchronize episodically input pulse whenever pulse frequency lie within neuron 's locking range propose behavior mechanism rate-code detection neuronal population result obtain numerical simulation morris-lecar model electronic implementation fitzhugh-nagumo system evidence robustness phenomenon
