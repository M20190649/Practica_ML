 reveal fine structure retinal receptive field deep learning network deep convolutional neural network cnns demonstrate impressive performance many visual task recently become useful model visual system neuroscience however still clear learn cnns term neuronal circuit deep cnn many layer use visual system easy compare structure component cnn possible neuroscience underpinnings due highly complex circuit retina high visual cortex address issue focus single retinal ganglion cell biophysical model record data animal train cnns white noise image predict neuronal response find fine structure retinal receptive field reveal specifically convolutional filter learn resemble biological component retinal circuit suggest cnn learn one single retinal cell reveal minimal neural network carry cell furthermore cnns learn different cell transfer cell diversity transfer learn performance indicate cnns cell-specific moreover cnns transfer different type input image white noise v.s natural image transfer learning show good performance imply cnn indeed capture full computational ability single retinal cell different input take together result suggest cnn could use reveal structure component neuronal circuit provide powerful model neural system identification
