 neural activity classification machine learn model train interspike interval series data flow information brain reflect activity pattern neural cell indeed firing pattern widely use input data predictive model relate stimulus animal behavior activity population neuron however relatively little attention pay single neuron spike train predictor cell network property brain work introduce approach neuronal spike train data mining enable effective classification clustering neuron type network activity state base single-cell spiking pattern approach center around apply state-of-the-art time series classification cluster method sequence interspike interval record single neuron demonstrate good performance method task involve classification neuron type e.g excitatory vs. inhibitory cell neural circuit activity state e.g awake vs. rem sleep vs. nonrem sleep state open-access cortical spiking activity dataset
