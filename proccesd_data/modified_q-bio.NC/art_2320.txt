 analytical condition synchrony neural network two periodic input study apply mean field theory neural network model two periodic input order clarify condition synchrony mean field theory yield self-consistent condition synchrony enable u study effect synaptic connection behavior neural network obtain condition synaptic connection synchrony cycle time neuron neural network receive sensory input top-down input outside network network neuron receive two input synchronization depend condition input also analyze case use mean field theory result clarify following point strong synaptic connection enhance shorter synchrony cycle neuron cycle synchrony becomes longer cycle external input becomes longer relationship among synaptic weight property input train cycle synchrony express one equation two area asynchrony association third point yielded equation simple calculation easily provide u feasible infeasible condition synchrony
