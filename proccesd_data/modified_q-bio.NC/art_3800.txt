 probabilistic pathway representation cognitive information present mental process program mathematical mapping successfully realize physical process emphasize project mathematical simulation brain 's functioning complex physical system i.e. mapping physical chemical process brain mathematical space project mapping purely mental process mathematical space present various argument -- philosophic mathematical information neurophysiological -- favor p -adic model mental space p -adic space structure hierarchic tree model tree hierarchy consider image neuronal hierarchy hierarchic neural pathway consider fundamental unit information processing neural pathway go whole body mental space produce whole neural system finally develop probabilistic neural pathway model mental state represent probability distribution mental space
