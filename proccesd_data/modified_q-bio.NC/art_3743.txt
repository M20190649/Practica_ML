 pitch perception dynamical-systems perspective two half millennium ago pythagoras initiate scientific study pitch sound yet understanding mechanism pitch perception remain incomplete physical model pitch perception try explain elementary principle certain physical characteristic stimulus lead particular pitch sensation two broad category pitch-perception model place spectral model consider pitch mainly relate fourier spectrum stimulus whereas periodicity temporal model characteristic time domain important current model either class usually computationally intensive implement series step less support auditory physiology however brain analyse react real time enormous amount information ear sens information efficiently represent process nervous system proposal nonlinear complex system research dynamical attractor may form basis neural information processing auditory system complex highly nonlinear dynamical system natural suppose dynamical attractor may carry perceptual functional meaning show idea scarcely develop current pitch model successfully apply pitch perception
