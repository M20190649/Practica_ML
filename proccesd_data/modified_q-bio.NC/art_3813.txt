 optimal dynamical range excitable network criticality recurrent idea study complex system optimal information processing find near bifurcation point phase transition however heuristic hypothesis concrete realization standard biologically relevant quantity optimize criticality give clear example phenomenon network excitable element sensitivity dynamic range maximize critical point non-equilibrium phase transition result compatible essential role gap junction olfactory glomerulus retinal ganglionar cell output synchronization global oscillation also appear network dynamic propose main functional role electrical coupling provide enhancement dynamic range therefore allow coding information span several order magnitude mechanism could provide microscopic neural basis psychophysical law
