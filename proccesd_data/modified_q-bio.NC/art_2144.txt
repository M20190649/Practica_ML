 effect noise model spiny dendrite study effect noise two model spiny dendrite introduction different type noise spike-diffuse-spike sd baer-rinzel br model investigate change behaviour travel wave solution present deterministic system noise intensity increase show speed wave propagation sd br model respectively decrease increase noise intensity spine head increase interestingly discrepancy model seem arise type active spine head dynamic employ model rather form spine density use contrast cable robust noise speed show little variation deterministic system look effect noise interpretation use evaluate stochastic integral ito statonovich discuss may appropriate also show correlation time length scale noise enhance propagation travel wave solution white noise dominate signal produce noise induced phenomenon
