 uncertainty visual measurement efficient allocation sensory resource review reason underlying two approach combination sensory uncertainty first approach noncommittal make assumption property uncertainty parameter stimulation explain relationship approach one commonly use model high level aspect sensory system visual cue integration assumption make property stimulation two approach follow similar logic except one case maximal uncertainty minimize minimal certainty maximize demonstrate optimal solution find problem resource allocation uncertainty
