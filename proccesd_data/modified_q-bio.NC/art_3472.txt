 visual attention beyond one single saliency map late year numerous bottom-up attention model propose different assumption however produced saliency map may different even input image also observe human fixation map varies across time greatly people freely view image tend allocate attention salient region large scale first search detailed region paper argue one input image visual attention describe one single saliency map mechanism model dynamic process frequency domain paradigm propose global inhibition model mimic process suppress non-saliency input image also show dynamic process influence one parameter frequency domain experiment illustrate propose model capable predict human dynamic fixation distribution
