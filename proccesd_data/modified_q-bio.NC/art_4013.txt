 charge-balanced minimum-power control spike neuron oscillator paper study optimal control phase model spike neuron oscillator focus design minimum-power current stimulus elicit spike neuron desired time furthermore take charge-balanced constraint account practice undesirable side effect may occur due accumulation electric charge result external stimulus charge-balanced minimum-power control derive general phase model use maximum principle case unbounded bound control amplitude examine latter practical importance since phase model accurate weak forcing developed optimal control strategy apply mathematically ideal experimentally observed phase model demonstrate applicability include phase model widely study hodgkin-huxley equation
