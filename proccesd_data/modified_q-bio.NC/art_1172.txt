 neuronal dynamic study neuromorphic chip neuronal firing activity attract lot attention since large population spatiotemporal pattern brain basis adaptive behavior also reveal sign various neurological disorder include alzheimer 's schizophrenia epilepsy others study dynamic simple neuronal network use different set setting neuromorphic chip observe three different type collective neuronal firing activity agree clinical data take brain construct brain phase diagram show within weak noise region brain operate expected noise-induced phase n-phase rather so-called self-organized critical boundary significance study twofold first deviation neuronal activity normal brain could symptomatic disease central nervous system thus pave way new diagnostics treatment second normal brain state n-phase optimal computation information processing latter may provide way establish powerful new compute paradigm use collective behavior network spike neuron
