 non-classicality mental state experimental study ambiguous audio music stimulus paper attempt address question whether present physical mathematical theory sufficient understand complexity human brain interact external environment form auditory stimulus.there effort report introduction ambiguity visual stimuli cause effect ca n't explain classically.in paper investigate whether ambiguity auditory stimulus introduce non-classical effect human brain.simple experiment perform normal subject listen ambiguous auditory signal respond question 'yes 'no'.the outcome test show classical formula total probability hold true case.results interesting indicate definite non-classicality mental state perception ambiguous audio stimulus
