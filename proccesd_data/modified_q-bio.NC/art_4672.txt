 deep driven fmri decoding visual category deep neural network develop draw inspiration brain visual pathway implement end-to-end approach image data video object class however build fmri decoder typical structure convolutional neural network cnn i.e learn multiple level representation seem impractical due lack brain data possible solution work present first hybrid fmri deep feature decode approach collect fmri deep learnt representation video object class link together mean kernel canonical correlation analysis decoding allow exploit discriminatory power cnn relate fmri representation last layer cnn fc show effectiveness embed fmri data onto subspace relate deep feature distinguish semantic visual category base solely brain imaging data
