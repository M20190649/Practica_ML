 nonnormal amplification random balance neuronal network dynamical model cortical network recurrent connectivity amplify input give network two distinct way one induce presence near-critical eigenvalue connectivity matrix w produce large slow activity fluctuation along corresponding eigenvectors dynamical slowing relies w nonnormal allow network activity make large fast excursion along specific direction investigate tradeoff nonnormal amplification dynamical slowing spontaneous activity large random neuronal network compose excitatory inhibitory neuron use schur decomposition w separate two amplification mechanism assume linear stochastic dynamic derive exact expression expected amount purely nonnormal amplification find amplification limited dynamical slowing must keep weak conclude achieve strong transient amplification little slowing connectivity must structure show unidirectional connection neuron type together reciprocal connection neuron different type allow amplification already fast dynamical regime finally result also shed light difference balance network inhibition exactly cancel excitation inhibition dominate
