 sparse connectivity map inference linear model use sister mitral cell sensory processing hard variable interest encode spike train relatively complex way major goal sensory processing understand brain extract variable revisit common encode model variable encode linearly although typically variable neuron problem still solvable small number variable appear one time sparse prior however previous solution usually require all-to-all connectivity inconsistent sparse connectivity see brain propose principled algorithm provably reach map inference solution use sparse connectivity algorithm inspire mouse olfactory bulb approach general enough apply modality addition possible extend nonlinear encode model
