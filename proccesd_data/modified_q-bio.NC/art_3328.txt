 asymmetrical voltage response resonant neuron shape nonlinearities conventional impedance profile neuron identify resonant property even though measure distinguish situation output signal nonlinear experimental observation show response neuron oscillatory input different frequency preferentially enhance either upper low part voltage envelope show asymmetric voltage response arise submit neuron model high amplitude oscillatory current variable frequency show nonlinearities associate different ionic current voltage equation lead asymmetrical response propose geometrical explanation phenomenon base activation curve addition identify unexpected frequency-dependent pattern develop gating variable current product strong nonlinearities system result report paper could use brain embed neuron discriminate oscillatory frequency dependent input upper low enhance voltage response
