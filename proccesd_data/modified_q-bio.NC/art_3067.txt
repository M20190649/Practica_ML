 human perception computer vision computer vision make remarkable progress recent year deep neural network dnn model optimize identify object image exhibit unprecedented task-trained accuracy remarkably generalization ability new visual problem solve easily base previous learning biological vision learn life evolution also accurate general-purpose possible different learning regime converge similar problem-dependent optimal computation therefore ask whether human system-level computation visual perception dnn correlate consider several anecdotal test case find perceptual sensitivity image change dnn mid-computation correlate sensitivity segmentation crowd shape dnn end-computation correlate result quantify applicability use dnn computation estimate perceptual loss consistent fascinating theoretical view property human perception consequence architecture-independent visual learning
