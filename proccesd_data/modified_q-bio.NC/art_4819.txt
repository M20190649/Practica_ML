 optimize channel selection seizure detection interpretation electroencephalogram eeg signal complicate obfuscate artifact artifact detection play important role observation analysis eeg signal spatial information contain placement electrode exploit accurately detect artifact however few electrode use less spatial information available make hard detect artifact study investigate performance deep learning algorithm cnn-lstm several channel configuration configuration design minimize amount spatial information lose compare standard -channel eeg system use reduced number channel range achieve sensitivity false alarm range per hour false alarm increase dramatically e.g. per hour number channel reduce baseline performance system use channel sensitivity false alarm since -channel system system include referential channel rapid increase false alarm rate number channel reduce underscore importance retain referential channel artifact reduction cautionary result important one big difference various type eeg administer type referential channel use
