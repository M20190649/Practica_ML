 analyse property c. elegans neural network mathematically model biological system brain one studied highly complex system biological world information center behind vertebrate invertebrate life thus become major focus current research many study concentrate study brain directly focus structure brain core interconnected network nodes neuron good understanding structural aspect brain elucidate functional property paper analyze brain nematode caenorhabditis elegans consist neuron one better-understood neural network use laplacian matrix -neuron giant component network use eigenvalue count function look fractal-like self similarity matrix representation also use plot eigenfunction coordinate dimensional visualization neural network analysis examine small-world property system include average path length cluster coefficient test localization eigenfunctions use graph energy spacial variance good understand result calculation also perform random network branch tree know fractal well fractal rewire small-world property analysis one many stepping-stones research neural network many structure function within brain know understand two interact also important firm grasp structural property neural network key step process
