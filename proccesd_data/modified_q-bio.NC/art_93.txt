 unbalanced synaptic inhibition create intensity-tuned auditory cortex neuron intensity-tuned auditory cortex neuron may form intensity-tuned synaptic excitation synaptic inhibition also show enhance possibly even create intensity-tuned neuron show use vivo whole cell recording pentobarbital-anesthetized rat intensity-tuned neuron indeed create solely disproportionally large inhibition high intensity without intensity-tuned excitation since inhibition essentially cortical origin neuron provide example auditory feature-selectivity arising de novo cortex
