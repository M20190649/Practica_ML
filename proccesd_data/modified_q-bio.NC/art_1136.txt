 encode sensory motor pattern time-invariant trajectory recurrent neural network much information brain process store temporal nature spoken word handwritten signature example define unfold time however remain unclear neural circuit encode complex time-varying pattern show tune weight recurrent neural network rnn recognize transcribe spoken digit model elucidate neural dynamic cortical network may resolve three fundamental challenge first encode multiple time-varying sensory motor pattern stable neural trajectory second generalize across relevant spatial feature third identify stimuli play different speed show temporal invariance emerges recurrent dynamic generate neural trajectory appropriately modulate angular velocity together result generate testable prediction recurrent network may use different mechanism generalize across relevant spatial temporal feature complex time-varying stimulus
