 learning may need bit synaptic precision learning neural network pose peculiar challenge use discretized rather continuous synaptic state choice discrete synapsis motivate biological reasoning experiment possibly hardware implementation consideration well paper extend previous large deviation analysis unveil existence peculiar dense region space synaptic state account possibility learn efficiently network binary synapsis extend analysis synapsis multiple state generally plausible biological feature result clearly indicate overall qualitative picture unchanged respect binary case robust variation detail model also provide quantitative result suggest advantage increase synaptic precision i.e number internal synaptic state rapidly vanish first bit therefore practical application bit may need near-optimal performance consistently recent biological finding finally demonstrate theoretical analysis exploit design efficient algorithmic search strategy
