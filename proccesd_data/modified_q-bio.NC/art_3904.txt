 spike train statistic consonant dissonant musical accord simple system compose three neural-like noisy element consider two sensory neuron sensor stimulate noise periodic signal different ratio frequency third one interneuron receive output two sensor noise propose analytical approach analysis interspike interval isi statistic spike train generate interneuron isi distribution sensory neuron consider know frequency input sinusoidal signal ratio usual music show case small integer ratio musical consonance input pair sinusoid result isi distribution appropriate regular output spike train case large integer ratio musical dissonance input frequency effect explain viewpoint propose theory
