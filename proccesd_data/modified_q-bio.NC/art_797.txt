 stabilize variance dynamic functional brain connectivity time series assessment dynamic functional brain connectivity dfc base fmri data increasingly popular strategy investigate temporal dynamic brain 's large-scale network architecture current practice derive connectivity estimate time use fisher transform aim stabilize variance correlation value fluctuate around vary true correlation value however unclear well stabilization signal variance perform fisher transform work connectivity time series true correlation assume fluctuate importance many subsequent analysis either assume perform good time series stable variance adheres approximate gaussian distribution paper use simulation analysis resting-state fmri data analyze effect apply different variance stabilization strategy connectivity time-series focus investigation fisher transform box cox transform approach combine transforms result show intention stabilize variance use metric time series stable variance gaussian distribution desire e.g clustering fisher transform optimal may even skew connectivity time series away gaussian show suboptimal performance fisher transform substantially improve include additional box-cox transformation dfc time series fisher transform
