 ising model neural data model quality approximate method extract functional connectivity study pairwise ising model describe statistic multi-neuron spike train use data simulated cortical network explore efficient way find optimal coupling model examine statistical property extract optimal coupling subset size neuron essentially exactly use boltzmann learning study quality several approximate method find coupling compare result find boltzmann learning two methods- inversion tap equation approximation propose sessak monasson- remarkably accurate use approximation large subset neuron find extract coupling use data subset small full network tend systematically overestimate magnitude effect describe qualitatively infinite-range spin glass theory normal phase also show globally-correlated input neuron network lead small increase average coupling however pair-to-pair variation coupling much large reflect intrinsic property network finally study quality model compare entropy data find perform well small subset neuron network fit quality start deteriorate subset size grows signal need include high order correlation describe statistic large network
