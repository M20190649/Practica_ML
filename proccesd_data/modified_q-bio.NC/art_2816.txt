 dynamical response external stimulus case excitatory inhibitory synchronization complex neuronal network study dynamical response external stimuli depend synaptic-coupling type consider two type excitatory inhibitory synchronization i.e. synchronization via synaptic excitation inhibition complex small-world network excitatory regular spike r pyramidal neuron inhibitory fast spike fs interneurons case excitatory inhibitory synchronization effect synaptic coupling dynamical response external time-periodic stimulus apply fraction neuron investigate vary drive amplitude stimulate neuron phase-locked external stimulus case excitatory inhibitory coupling hand stimulation effect non-stimulated neuron depend type synaptic coupling external stimulus make constructive effect excitatory non-stimulated r neuron i.e. cause external phase locking non-stimulated sub-population make destructive effect inhibitory non-stimulated f interneurons i.e. break original inhibitory synchronization non-stimulated sub-population result different effect type degree dynamical response e.g. synchronization enhancement suppression characterize dynamical response factor f give ratio synchronization degree presence absence stimulus find vary distinctly different way depend synaptic-coupling type furthermore also measure matching degree dynamic two sub-populations stimulated non-stimulated neuron term cross-correlation measure c increase base c discuss cross-correlations two sub-populations affect dynamical response
