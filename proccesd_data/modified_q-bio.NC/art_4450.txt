 pyspike python library analyze spike train synchrony understand brain function one big challenge time analysis experimentally record neural firing pattern spike train play crucial role address problem pyspike library introduce python package spike train analysis provide parameter-free time-scale independent measure spike train synchrony allow compute similarity dissimilarity profile average value distance matrix although mainly focus neuroscience pyspike also apply context like climate research social science package available open source github pypi
