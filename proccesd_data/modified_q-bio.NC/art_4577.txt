 neural signal multiplexing via compress sense transport neural signal brain challenge owe neural interference neural noise experimental evidence multiplexing sensory information across population neuron particularly vertebrate visual olfactory system recently discover lateral intraparietal cortex brain decision signal multiplexed decision-irrelevant visual signal furthermore well know several cortical neuron exhibit chaotic spiking pattern multiplexing chaotic neural signal successful demultiplexing neuron amidst interference noise difficult explain work novel compress sense model efficient multiplexing chaotic neural signal construct use hindmarsh-rose spiking model propose signal multiplexed pre-synaptic neuron neighbour post-synaptic neuron presence interfere noisy neural signal demultiplexed use compressed sense technique
