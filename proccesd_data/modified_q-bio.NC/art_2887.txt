 oscillation spurious state associative memory model synaptic depression associative memory model typical neural network model store discretely distribute fixed-point attractor memory pattern network store memory pattern extensively however model attractor besides memory pattern attractor call spurious memory spurious state memory state equilibrium little difference dynamic recent physiological experiment show short-term dynamic synapse call synaptic depression decrease transmission efficacy postsynaptic neuron accord activity presynaptic neuron previous study show synaptic depression induces oscillation network decrease storage capacity finite temperature synaptic depression affect spurious state however still unclear investigate effect synaptic depression spurious state monte carlo simulation result demonstrate synaptic depression affect memory state mainly destabilize spurious state induce periodic oscillation
