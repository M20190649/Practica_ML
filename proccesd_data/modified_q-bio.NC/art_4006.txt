 integrate temporal spatial scale human structural network motif across age region-of-interest size human brain network characterize different temporal spatial scale give age subject spatial resolution neuroimaging method integration data across scale successful combined network show similar architecture one way compare network look spatial feature base fibre length topological feature individual node outlier node form single node motif whose frequency yield fingerprint network observe characteristic single node motif change age year network size node diffusion tensor image dti structural connectivity healthy human subject first find number diversity motif network strongly correlate second compare different scale number diversity motif vary across temporal subject age spatial network resolution scale certain motif might occur one spatial scale certain age range third region interest show one motif low resolution may show range motif high resolution may may include original motif low resolution therefore type localisation motif differ different spatial resolution result also indicate spatial resolution high effect topological measure whereas spatial measure base fibre length remain comparable resolution therefore spatial resolution crucial compare characteristic node fingerprint give topological spatial network feature node motif base topological spatial property brain connectivity network conclusion also relevant study use connectome analysis
