 graph coarse-graining reveals difference module-level structure functional brain network network analysis rapidly become standard tool study functional magnetic resonance image fmri data framework different brain area map node network whose link depict functional dependency area size area node portray vary study recently recommend original volume element voxels imaging experiment use network node avoid artefact bias however result large number node link sheer amount detail may obscure important network feature manifest large scale one fruitful approach detect feature partition network module i.e group node densely connect internally connection however attempt understand functional network differ simply compare individual modular structure daunt task result may hard interpret show instead compare different partition beneficial analyze difference connectivity within module network obtain different condition develop network coarse-graining methodology provide easily interpretable result allow assess statistical significance observed difference feasibility method demonstrate analyze fmri data record healthy subject rest movie viewing independent partitioning network correspond two condition yield insight difference network coarse-graining allow u pinpoint e.g increased number intra-module link within visual cortex movie viewing
