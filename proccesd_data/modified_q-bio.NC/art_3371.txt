 cross-paradigm pretraining convolutional network improve intracranial eeg decode come classification brain signal real-life application training prediction data often describe different distribution furthermore diverse data set e.g. record various subject task even exhibit distinct feature space fact data classify often available small amount reinforce need technique generalize learned information performance brain-computer interface bcis enhance increase quantity available data paper apply transfer learn framework base deep convolutional neural network deep convnets prove transferability learned pattern error-related brain signal across different task experiment describe paper demonstrate usefulness transfer learning especially improve performance little data use distinguish erroneous correct realization task effect could delimit transfer merely general brain signal characteristic underline transfer error-specific information furthermore could extract similar pattern time-frequency analysis identical channel lead selective high signal correlation two different paradigm classification intracranial data yield median accuracy pm decode data without pre-training reach performance pm compare pm pre-training
