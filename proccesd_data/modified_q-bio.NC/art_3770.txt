 maximally informative dimension analyze neural response natural signal propose method would allow rigorous statistical analysis neural response natural stimulus non-gaussian exhibit strong correlation mind model neuron selective small number stimulus dimension high dimensional stimulus space within subspace response arbitrarily nonlinear exist analysis method base correlation function stimulus response method guarantee work case gaussian stimulus ensemble alternative correlation function maximize mutual information neural response projection stimulus onto low dimensional subspace procedure do iteratively increase dimensionality subspace dimension allow recovery information spike full unprojected stimulus describe relevant subspace dimensionality relevant subspace indeed small become feasible map neuron 's input-output function even fully natural stimulus condition idea illustrate simulation model visual neuron respond natural scene
