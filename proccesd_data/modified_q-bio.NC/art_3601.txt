 tailored ensemble neural network optimize sensitivity stimulus statistic dynamic range stimulus processing living organism much large single neural network explain generic tunable spike network derive dynamic range maximal criticality interval discriminable intensity similar network tune due coalescence compensate coalescence enables adaptation discriminable interval thus tailor ensemble network optimize distribution stimulus intensity e.g. extend dynamic range arbitrarily discuss potential application machine learning
