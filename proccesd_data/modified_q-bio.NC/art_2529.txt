 neural computation thermal limit although several measurement analysis support idea brain energy-optimized one disturbing contradictory observation theory computation limit thermal noise occur cheaply cdot joule per bit ktln unfortunately neuron ostensible discrepancy minimum startle ignore inhibition discrepancy times amount take inhibition account point define neural computation actually combination computation neural communication communication cost transmission excitatory postsynaptic activation -gating-charges fast na channel initial segment fna 's dominate joule-costs make distinction communication initial segment computation initial segment i.e. add activated fna 's implies size average synaptic event reach fna 's size standard deviation thermal noise moreover define computation addition activated fna 's yield biophysically plausible mechanism approach desired minimum mechanism require something like electrical engineer 's equalizer much action potential generating conductance operate threshold active filter modify last synaptic excitation provide barely enough energy allow last sub-threshold gate charge transport last threshold-achieving -subunit activation require energy match information provide last synaptic event ratio near ktln joule per bit
