 digital system reconstruction pairwise transfer entropy transfer entropy te attractive model-free method detect causality infer structural connectivity general digital system however rely high dimension use definition clearly remove memory effect distinguish direct causality indirect one make almost inoperable practice work try use low order pairwise te framework binary data suitably filter record signal avoid high dimensional problem setting find explain te value connect unconnected pair significant difference magnitude easily classify cluster method phenomenon widely robustly hold wide range system dynamical regime addition find te value quadratically relate coupling strength thus establish quantitative mapping causal structural connectivity
