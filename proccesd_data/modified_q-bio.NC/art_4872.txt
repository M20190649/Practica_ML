 community structure detection evaluation pre- post-ictal hippocampal depth recording detect evaluate region brain various circumstance one interesting topic computational neuroscience however majority study detect community functional connectivity network brain do network obtain coherency attribute correlation lack study part due fact many common method cluster graph require node network positively link together property guarantee coherency matrix definition however correlation matrix reveal information regard pair node link together study first time simultaneously examine four inherently different network cluster method spectral heuristic optimization method apply functional connectivity network ca region hippocampus anaesthetized rat pre-ictal post-ictal state network obtain correlation matrix result compare one obtain apply method coherency matrix correlation matrices show much finer community structure compare coherency matrix furthermore examine potential smoothing effect choose various window size compute correlation coherency matrix
