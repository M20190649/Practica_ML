 topological mapping space bat hippocampus mammalian hippocampus play key role spatial learning memory exact nature hippocampal representation space still explore recently fair amount success model hippocampal spatial map rat assume topological perspective spatial information processing paper use topological model study learn bat produce several insight neurophysiological mechanism hippocampal spatial mapping first demonstrate functional importance cell assembly produce accurate map environment second model suggest readout neuron cell assembly function integrator synaptic input rather detector place cell coactivity allow estimate integration time window lastly model suggest contrast relatively slow move rat suppress theta -precession bat improve place cell capacity encode spatial map consistent experimental observation
