 decode hand kinematics local field potential use long short-term memory lstm network local field potential lfp gain increase interest alternative input signal brain-machine interface bmis due informative feature long-term stability low frequency content however despite interesting property lfp-based bmi report yield low decode performance compare spike-based bmi paper propose new decoder base long short-term memory lstm network aim improve decode performance lfp-based bmi compare offline decode performance propose lstm decoder commonly use kalman filter kf decoder hand kinematics prediction task multichannel lfps also benchmark performance lfp-driven lstm decoder kf decoder drive two type spike signal single-unit activity sua multi-unit activity mua result show lfp-driven lstm decoder achieve significantly well decode performance lfp- sua- mua-driven kf decoder suggest lfps couple lstm decoder could provide high decode performance robust low power bmi
