 adaptive oscillator network conserved overall coupling sequential firing near-synchronized state motivate recent observation neuronal system investigate all-to-all network non-identical oscillator adaptive coupling adaptation model spike-timing-dependent plasticity sum weight incoming link conserve find multiple phase-locked state fall two class near-synchronized state splay state among near-synchronized state state oscillate frequency depend weakly coupling strength essentially give frequency one oscillator however neither fast slow oscillator sufficiently large network adaptive coupling find develop effective network topology dominate one two loop result multitude stable splay state differ firing sequence increase couple strength frequency increase linearly oscillator become less synchronized essential feature two class state capture analytically perturbation analysis extended kuramoto model use simulation
