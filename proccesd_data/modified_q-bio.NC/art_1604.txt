 biological quantum network solve np-hard problem widespread view human brain complex efficiently simulate universal turing machine last decades question therefore raise whether need consider quantum effect explain imagined cognitive power conscious mind paper present personal view several field philosophy computational neurobiology attempt suggest realistic picture brain might work basis perception consciousness cognition purpose able identify evaluate instance quantum effect might play significant role cognitive process surprisingly conclusion quantum-enhanced cognition intelligence unlikely find biological brain quantum effect may certainly influence functionality various component signal pathway molecular level brain network like ion port synapsis sensor enzyme might evidently influence functionality node perhaps even overall intelligence brain network hardly give dramatically enhanced functionality conclusion biological quantum network approximately solve small instance np-hard problem hand artificial intelligence machine learning implement complex dynamical system base genuine quantum network certainly expect show enhanced performance quantum advantage compare classical network nevertheless even quantum network expect efficiently solve np-hard problem approximately end question precision nature approximate
