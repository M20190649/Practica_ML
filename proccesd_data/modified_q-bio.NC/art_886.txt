 differential covariance new class method estimate sparse connectivity neural recording ability record neuron simultaneously make sense data challenge functional connectivity one popular way study relationship multiple neural signal correlation-based method set currently well-used technique functional connectivity estimation however due explain away unobserved common input stevenson et al. produce spurious connection general linear model glm model spike train poisson process okatan et al. truccolo et al. pillow et al. avoids confounds develop new class method use differential signal base simulated intracellular voltage recording equivalent regularize ar model also expand method simulate local field potential lfp recording calcium imaging simulated data differential covariance-based method achieve well similar performance glm method require few data sample new class method provide alternative way analyze neural signal
