 temporal neural network model object recognition use biologically plausible decision make layer brain recognize different object one experience recognition accuracy processing time depend task property view condition level noise etc recognition accuracy well explain different model however less attention pay processing time one biologically plausible extract feature temporally well utilize accumulation bind decision make model object recognition model accounting recognition time accuracy propose temporally extract informative feature support possible class stimulus hierarchical spiking neural network call spiking hmax modify decision make part model extract information accumulate time use accumulator unit input category determine soon accumulator reach threshold call decision bound result show model follow human accuracy psychophysics task well classic spiking hmax model also predict human response time choice result provide enough evidence temporal representation feature informative since improve accuracy biological plausible decision maker time also line well-known idea speed accuracy trade-off decision making study
