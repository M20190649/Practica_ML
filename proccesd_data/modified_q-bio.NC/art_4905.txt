 brain synchronizability false friend synchronization play fundamental role healthy cognitive motor function however synchronization depend interplay local dynamic couple topology prone synchronization network give topological organization still poorly understood issue investigate synchronizability anatomical functional brain network various study resort master stability function msf formalism elegant tool allow analyse stability synchronous state dynamical system consist many coupled oscillator argue brain dynamic fulfil formal criterion synchronizability usually quantify perhaps importantly measure quantify refers global dynamical condition never hold brain even pathological condition therefore neurophysiological conclusion draw base discuss meaning synchronizability applicability neuroscience propose alternative way quantify brain network synchronization
