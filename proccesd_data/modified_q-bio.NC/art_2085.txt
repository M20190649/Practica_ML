 leader neuron leaky integrate fire neural network simulation several experimental study show existence leader neuron population burst live neural network leader neuron basically neuron fire beginning burst respectively network spike often expect look whole mean neural activity mean leader neuron burst trigger power beyond simple statistical effect study characterize leader neuron property naturally lead u simulate neural network build simulation choose leaky integrate fire lif neuron model lif model get stable leader neuron burst population simulate leader neuron excitatory neuron low membrane potential firing threshold except two first property condition require neuron leader neuron difficult identify seem depend several parameter involve simulation themself however detailed linear analysis show trend property require neuron leader neuron main finding leader neuron send signal many excitatory neuron well inhibitory neuron leader neuron receive signal excitatory neuron linear analysis exhibit five essential property leader neuron relative importance mean consider give neural network fixed mean number connection per neuron analysis give u way predict neuron good leader neuron prediction formula give u good statistical prediction even consider single give neuron success rate reach hundred percent
