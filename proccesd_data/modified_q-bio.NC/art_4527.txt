 modular continual learning unified visual environment core aspect human intelligence ability learn new task quickly switch flexibly describe modular continual reinforcement learn paradigm inspire ability first introduce visual interaction environment allow many type task unify single framework describe reward map prediction scheme learn new task robustly large state action space require environment investigate property module architecture influence efficiency task learning show module motif incorporate specific design principle e.g early bottleneck low-order polynomial nonlinearities symmetry significantly outperform standard neural network motif need few training example few neuron achieve high level performance finally present meta-controller architecture task switch base dynamic neural voting scheme allow new module use information learn previously-seen task substantially improve learning efficiency
