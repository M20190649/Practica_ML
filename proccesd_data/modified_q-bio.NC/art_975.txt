 direct estimation fire rate calcium image data two-photon imaging calcium indicator allow simultaneous recording response hundred neuron hour even day provide relatively indirect measure spiking activity exist deconvolution algorithm attempt recover spike observed image data commonly subject analyse apply electrophysiologically recorded spike e.g. estimation average firing rate tune curve show however presence noise approach often heavily bias propose alternative analysis aim estimate underlie rate directly integrate unobserved spike instead commit single estimate spike train approach use estimate average firing rate tune curve directly image data sufficiently flexible incorporate prior knowledge tune structure show directly estimate rate accurate obtain average spike estimate deconvolution simulate data image data acquire mouse visual cortex
