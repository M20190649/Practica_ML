 white matter fiber segmentation use functional varifolds extraction fiber dmri data typically produce large number fiber common group fiber bundle end many specialize distance measure mcp use fiber similarity however distance base approach require point-wise correspondence focus geometry fiber recent publication highlight use microstructure measure along fiber improves tractography analysis also many neurodegenerative disease impact white matter require study microstructure measure well white matter geometry motivate propose use novel computational model fiber call functional varifolds characterize metric consider geometry microstructure measure e.g gfa along fiber pathway use cluster fiber dictionary learning sparse coding-based framework present preliminary analysis use hcp data
