 geometric renormalization unravels self-similarity multiscale human connectome structural connectivity brain typically study reduce observation single spatial resolution however brain pose rich architecture organize multiple scale link one another explore multiscale organization human connectome use dataset healthy subject reconstruct five different resolution find structure human brain remain self-similar resolution length progressively decrease hierarchical coarse-graining anatomical region strikingly geometric renormalization connectome map hyperbolic space decrease resolution coarse-graining averaging short similarity distance predict property connectomes include self-similarity result suggest principle regulate connectivity brain region different length scale multiscale self-similarity brain connectomes may offer advantageous architecture navigation purpose implication vary affect fundamental debate like whether brain work near critical point lead application include advanced tool simplify digital reconstruction simulation brain
