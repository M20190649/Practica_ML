 characterize ambiguity light source invariant shape shade shape shade classical inverse problem computer vision shape reconstruction problem inherently ill-defined depend assumed light source direction introduce novel mathematical formulation calculate local surface shape base covariant derivative shade flow field rather customary integral minimization p.d.e approach smooth surface show second derivative brightness independent light source directly relate surface property use measurement define match local family surface result give shading patch change emphasis characterize ambiguity problem give example local surface ambiguity collapse along certain image contour use reconstruction problem
