 semiparametric bayesian model detect synchrony among multiple neuron propose scalable semiparametric bayesian model capture dependency among multiple neuron detect co-firing possibly lag time pattern time discretizing time one spike interval result sequence 's spike 's silence neuron model use logistic function continuous latent variable gaussian process prior multiple neuron corresponding marginal distribution couple joint probability distribution use parametric copula model advantage approach follow nonparametric component i.e. gaussian process model provide flexible framework model underlie firing rate parametric component i.e. copula model allow u make inference regard contemporaneous lagged relationship among neuron use copula model construct multivariate probabilistic model separate modeling univariate marginal distribution modeling dependence structure among variable method easy implement use computationally efficient sample algorithm easily extend high dimensional problem use simulate data show approach could correctly capture temporal dependency fire rate identify synchronous neuron also apply model spike train data obtain prefrontal cortical area rat 's brain
