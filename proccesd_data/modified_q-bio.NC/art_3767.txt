 separation multiple evoked response use differential amplitude latency variability neuroelectrophysiology one record electric potential magnetic field generate ensemble synchronously active neuron response externally present stimulus evoked response often produce multiple generator presence ongoing background activity source localization technique current source density estimation usually use identify generator application blind source separation technique obtain independent component become popular approach problem apply bayesian methodology physiologically-realistic source model generally accept single trial vary amplitude latency incorporate variability model rather make unrealistic assumption cortical component independent one another algorithm utilize differential amplitude latency variability evoked waveform identify cortical component algorithm apply intracortically-recorded local field potential monkey perform visuomotor task
