 neuromodulation influence synchronization intrinsic read-out background role neuromodulation neural network cortical microcolumn still incompletely understood neuromodulation influence neural processing presynaptic postsynaptic regulation synaptic efficacy neuromodulation also affect ion channel intrinsic excitability method synaptic efficacy modulation effective way rapidly alter network density topology alter network topology density measure effect spike synchronization also operate differently parameterized neuron model alter neuron intrinsic excitability i.e. activation function result find fast synaptic efficacy modulation influence amount correlated spiking network also b synchronization network influence read-out intrinsic property highly synchronous input drive neuron difference intrinsic property disappear asynchronous input let intrinsic property determine output behavior thus alter network topology alter balance intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity conclusion conclude neuromodulation may allow network shift synchronized transmission mode asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode significant implication understanding flexibility cortical computation
