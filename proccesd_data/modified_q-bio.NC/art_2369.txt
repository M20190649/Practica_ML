 resolution enhancement neural network dynamical synapsis conventionally information represent spike rate neural system consider ability temporally modulate activity neuronal network carry information extra spike rate temporal modulation commonly know population spike due presence synaptic depression neuronal network model discuss relevance experiment transparent motion macaque monkey treue et al find move direction object close firing rate profile similar one direction difference move direction object large enough neuronal system would respond way network enhance resolution move direction object paper propose behavior reproduce neural network dynamical synapsis multiple external input demonstrate resolution enhancement achieve discuss condition temporally modulate activity able enhance information processing performance general
