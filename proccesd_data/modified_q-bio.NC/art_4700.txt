 variational laplace approach approximate bayesian inference variational approach approximate bayesian inference provide efficient mean perform parameter estimation model selection among so-called variational-laplace vl scheme rely gaussian approximation posterior density model parameter note review main variant vl approach follow consider nonlinear model continuous categorical data en passant also derive novel theoretical result complete portfolio exist analysis variational bayesian approach include investigation asymptotic convergence also suggest practical way extend exist vl approach hierarchical generative model include e.g. precision hyperparameters
