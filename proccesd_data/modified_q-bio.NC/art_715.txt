 stimulus-dependent frequency modulation information transmission neural system neural oscillation universal phenomenon observe different level neural system single neuron macroscopic brain frequency oscillation relate brain function however little know oscillating frequency neural system affect neural information transmission paper investigate signal processing single neuron modulate subthreshold membrane potential oscillation generate upstream rhythmic neural activity find high frequency oscillation facilitate transferring strong signal whereas slow oscillation weak signal though capacity information convey weak signal low single neuron greatly enhance weak signal transfer multiple pathway different oscillation phase provide simple phase plane analysis explain mechanism stimulus-dependent frequency modulation leakage integrate-and-fire neuron model result provide basic understanding brain could modulate information processing simply oscillate frequency
