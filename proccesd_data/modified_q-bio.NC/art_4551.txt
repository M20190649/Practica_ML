 time category information pattern-based code sensory stimulus usually compose different feature appear irregular time neural response often use spike pattern represent sensory information hypothesize encode identity elicit pattern pattern category time position pattern pattern timing however standard view oversimplify real world might separable concept instance correlate stimulus addition neuronal dynamic condition pattern timing correlate pattern category hence timing category pattern may constitute independent channel information paper assess role spike pattern neural code irrespective nature pattern first define information-theoretical quantity allow u quantify information encode different aspect neural response also introduce notion synergy redundancy time position category pattern subsequently establish relation stimulus timing category pattern aim quantify mutual information different aspect stimulus different aspect response formal framework allow u determine precise condition standard view hold well departure simple case finally study capability different response aspect represent neural response
