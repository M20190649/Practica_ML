 resolve coil shape reveals new reorientation behavior c. elegans exploit reduced space c. elegans posture develop novel tracking algorithm capture simple shape also self-occluding coil important yet unexplored component worm behavior apply algorithm show visually complex coiled sequence superposition two simpler pattern body wave dynamic head-curvature pulse demonstrate precise coil dynamic escape response uncover new behavior spontaneous large amplitude coil deep reorientation occur classical omega-shaped posture also large new postural excitation label delta-turns find omega delta turn occur independently serpentine analog random left-right step suggest distinct triggering mechanism also show omega delta turn display approximately equal rate adapt food-free condition similar timescale simple strategy avoid navigational bias
