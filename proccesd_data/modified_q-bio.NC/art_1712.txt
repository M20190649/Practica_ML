 visual illusion via neural dynamic wilson-cowan-type model efficient representation principle work aim reproduce supra-threshold perception phenomenon specifically visual illusion wilson-cowan-type model neuronal dynamic find indeed possible ability replicate visual illusion relate well neural activity equation comply efficient representation principle first contribution show wilson-cowan equation reproduce number brightness orientation-dependent illusion latter type illusion require neuronal dynamic equation consider explicitly orientation expect formally prove ca n't energy functional wilson-cowan equation minimize slight modification make variational yield model consistent efficient representation principle finally show new model provide good reproduction visual illusion original wilson-cowan formulation
