 common connectome constraint c. elegans drosophila homo sapiens neural system show modular typically also hierarchical organisation across different level across different specie topology relate function also influences dynamic early study show effect synchrony oscillation activity propagation understand link hierarchical organisation processing e.g consciousness structurally correlate top level hierarchy 'top network remain one main challenge field addition although neuron node often treat uniform entity differ term function e.g inhibitory vs. excitatory morphology gene expression pattern
