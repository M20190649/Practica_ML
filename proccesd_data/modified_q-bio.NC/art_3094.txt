 measure spike train synchrony data multiple time-scales background measure spike train synchrony widely use experimental computational neuroscience time-scale independent parameter-free measure isi-distance spike-distance spike-synchronization preferable time-scale parametric measure since adapt local firing rate take account time-scales give dataset new method data contain multiple time-scales e.g regular spiking burst one typically less interested small time-scales adaptive approach need propose a-isi-distance a-spike-distance a-spike-synchronization generalize original measure consider local relative global time-scales a-spike-distance also introduce rate-independent extension call ria-spike-distance focus specifically spike timing result adaptive generalization a-isi-distance a-spike-distance allow disregard spike time difference relevant global scale a-spike-synchronization long demand unreasonably high accuracy spike doublet coincide burst finally ria-spike-distance prove independent rate ratio spike train comparison exist method find compare original version a-isi-distance a-spike-distance yield improvement spike train contain different time-scales without exhibit unwanted side effect example a-spike-synchronization match spike efficiently spike-synchronization conclusion proposal complete picture since provide adaptive generalized measure sensitive rate a-isi-distance time ari-spike-distance time a-spike-distance
