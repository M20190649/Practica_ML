 robust entropy require strong balanced excitatory inhibitory synapsis widely appreciate well-balanced excitation inhibition necessary proper function neural network however principle balance could achieve many possible configuration excitatory inhibitory strength relative number excitatory inhibitory neuron instance give level excitation could balance either numerous inhibitory neuron weak synapsis inhibitory neuron strong synapsis among continuum different balanced configuration particular configuration favor address question context entropy network dynamic study analytically tractable network binary neuron find entropy high boundary excitation-dominant inhibition-dominant regime entropy also vary along boundary trade-off high robust entropy weak synapse strength yield high network entropy fragile parameter variation strong synapse strength yield low robust network entropy case inhibitory excitatory synapsis constrain similar strength find small non-zero fraction inhibitory neuron like see mammalian cortex result robust relatively high entropy
