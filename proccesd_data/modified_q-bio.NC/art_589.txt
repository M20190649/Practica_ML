 towards optimal decision strategy visual search search object amongst clutter key ability visual system speed accuracy often crucial visual system trade compete quantity optimal performance different task trade-off depend target appearance scene complexity show optimal tradeoff strategy may cast solution partially observable markov decision process pomdp compute dynamic programming procedure however procedure computationally intensive visual scene become cluttered therefore also conjecture optimal strategy scale large number clutter conjecture apply homogeneous visual search special case heterogenous search signal-to-noise ratio differs across location use conjecture show two exist decision mechanism analyze human data namely diffusion-to-bound maximum-of-output sub-optimal optimal strategy instead employ two scaled diffusion
