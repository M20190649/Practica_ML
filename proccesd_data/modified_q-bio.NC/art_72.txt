 synchronization electrically couple neural network report investigate synchronization temporal activity electrically couple neural network model electrical coupling establish homotypic static gap-junctions connexin two distinct network topology namely em sparse random network srn em fully connect network fcn use establish connectivity strength connectivity fcn govern em mean gap junctional conductance mu case srn overall strength connectivity govern em density connection delta connection strength two neuron synchronization network increase gap junctional strength vary population size investigate observe network em abruptly make transition weakly synchronize well synchronize regime delta mu exceed critical value also observe delta mu value use achieve synchronization decrease increase network size
