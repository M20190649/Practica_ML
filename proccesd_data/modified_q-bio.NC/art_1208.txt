 central peripheral vision scene recognition neurocomputational modeling exploration role central peripheral vision human scene recognition larson loschky show peripheral vision contribute central vision obtain maximum scene recognition accuracy however central vision efficient scene recognition peripheral base amount visual area need accurate recognition study model explain result larson loschky use neurocomputational modeling approach show advantage peripheral vision scene recognition well efficiency advantage central vision replicate use state-of-the-art deep neural network model addition propose provide support hypothesis peripheral advantage come inherent usefulness peripheral feature result consistent data present thibaut tran szaffarczyk boucart show patient central vision loss still categorize natural scene efficiently furthermore use deep mixture-of-experts model deep model tdm receive central peripheral visual information separate channel simultaneously show peripheral advantage emerge naturally learning process train categorize scene model weight peripheral pathway central pathway see previous modeling work learn create transform spread different scene category different region representational space finally visualize feature two pathway find different preference scene category emerge two pathway training process
