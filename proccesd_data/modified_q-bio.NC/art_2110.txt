 stochastic continuous time neurite branching model tree segment dependent rate paper introduce continuous time stochastic neurite branch model closely relate discrete time stochastic bes-model discrete time bes-model underlie current attempt simulate cortical development difficult analyze new continuous time formulation facilitate analytical treatment thus allow u examine structure model closely derive explicit expression time dependent probability p gamma find tree gamma time valid arbitrary continuous time branch model tree segment dependent branching rate show specific case continuous time bes-model expect model formulation sum need evaluate expectation value function terminal segment number mu f n depend distribution total branching probability terminal segment addition derive system differential equation probability p n find n terminal segment time t. continuous bes-model system differential equation give direct numerical access function depend number terminal segment use evaluate development mean standard deviation number terminal segment time t. comparison discuss two case mean variance number terminal segment exactly solvable discuss numerical evaluation s-dependence solution continuous time bes-model numerical result show clearly high value i.e value proximal terminal segment high branch rate distal terminal segment lead symmetrical tree measure three tree symmetry indicator
