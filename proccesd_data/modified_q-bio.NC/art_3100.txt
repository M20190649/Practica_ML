 semi-analytical approximation statistical moment sigmoid softmax mapping normal variable note concern accurate computationally efficient approximation moment gaussian random variable pass sigmoid softmax mapping approximation semi-analytical i.e involve numerical adjustment parametric form highly accurate yield error also highlight niche application approximation arise context e.g. drift-diffusion model decision making non-parametric data cluster approach provide example efficient alternative tedious derivation would need one approach underlying mathematical issue formal way hope technical note helpful modeller face similar mathematical issue although maybe stem different academic prospect
