 differentiate rest brain state use ordinal symbolic analysis symbolic method analysis valuable tool investigate complex time-dependent signal particular ordinal method defines sequence symbol accord ordering value appear time series method show yield useful information even apply signal large noise contamination use ordinal analysis investigate transition eye close ec eye open eo rest state analyze two eeg datasets healthy subject different record condition sample rate number electrode scalp use diagnostic tool permutation entropy entropy compute symbolic transition probability asymmetry coefficient measure asymmetry likelihood transition symbol show ordinal analysis apply raw data distinguishes two brain state datasets find eo state characterize high entropy low asymmetry coefficient compare ec state result thus show diagnostic tool potential detect characterize change time-evolving brain state
