 exploration synergistic redundant information share static dynamical gaussian system fully characterize information two source variable carry third target variable one must decompose total information redundant unique synergistic component i.e obtain partial information decomposition pid however shannon 's theory information provide formula fully determine quantity several recent study begin address possible definition pid quantity propose analysis carry system compose discrete variable present first in-depth analysis pid gaussian system static dynamical show broad class gaussian system previously propose pid formula imply redundancy reduces minimum information provide either source variable hence independent correlation source ii synergy extra information contribute weak source strong source know either increase decrease correlation source find gaussian system frequently exhibit net synergy i.e information carry jointly source great sum information carry source individually draw several explicit example discuss implication finding measure information transfer information-based measure complexity generally within neuroscience setting importantly provide independent formula synergy redundancy applicable continuous time-series data open new approach characterize quantify information share amongst complex system variable
