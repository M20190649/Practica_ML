 deep network resemble human feed-forward vision invariant object recognition deep convolutional neural network dcnns attract much attention recently show able recognize thousand object category natural image database architecture somewhat similar human visual system use restrict receptive field hierarchy layer progressively extract abstracted feature yet unknown whether dcnns match human performance task view-invariant object recognition whether make similar error use similar representation task whether answer depend magnitude viewpoint variation investigate issue benchmarked eight state-of-the-art dcnns hmax model baseline shallow model compare result human backward masking unlike previous dcnn study carefully control magnitude viewpoint variation demonstrate shallow net outperform deep net human variation weak face large variation however layer need match human performance error distribution representation consistent human behavior deep net layer even outperform human high variation level use human-like representation
