 learn universal computation spike provide neurobiological basis information processing high animal spike neural network must able learn variety complicated computation include generation appropriate possibly delay reaction input self-sustained generation complex activity pattern e.g locomotion many computation require previous building intrinsic world model show spiking neural network may solve different task firstly derive constraint class spike neural network lend substrate powerful general purpose computing network contain dendritic synaptic nonlinearities constrain connectivity combine network learning rule output recurrent connection show allow learn even difficult benchmark task self-sustained generation desired low-dimensional chaotic dynamic memory-dependent computation furthermore show spiking network build model external world system use acquire knowledge control
