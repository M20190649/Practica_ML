 argument nested pattern neural ensemble paper describe relatively simple way allow brain model self-organise concept pattern nested structure time key element simulator would able show pattern may form fire sequence part search thought process use simple equation show inhibitor particular switch certain area allow area become prominent one thereby define current brain state allow small amount control appear chaotic structure inside brain attractive still mostly mechanical therefore add automatic process modelling paper also describe nested pattern structure use basic counting mechanism
