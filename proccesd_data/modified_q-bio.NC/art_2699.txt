 fire dynamic autaptic neuron autapses synapses connect neuron nervous system previously experimental theoretical study demonstrate autaptic connection nervous system significant physiological function autapses nature provide self-delayed feedback thus introduce additional time scale neuronal activity cause many dynamic behavior neuron recently theoretical study reveal autapse provide control option adjust response neuron e.g. autaptic connection cause electrical activity hindmarsh-rose neuron switch quiescent periodic chaotic firing pattern autapse enhance suppress mode-locking status neuron inject sinusoidal current firing frequency interspike interval distribution response spike train also modify autapse paper review recent study show autapse affect response single neuron
