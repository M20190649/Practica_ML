 autism classification use brain functional connectivity dynamic machine learn goal present study identify autism use machine learn technique resting-state brain imaging data leverage temporal variability functional connection fc information estimate compare fc variability across brain region typical healthy subject autistic population analyze brain image data world-wide multi-site database know abide autism brain image data exchange analysis reveal patient diagnose autism spectrum disorder asd show increase fc variability several brain region associate low fc variability typical brain use enhanced fc variability brain region feature train machine learning model asd classification achieve accuracy identification asd versus control subject within dataset also use node strength estimate number functional connection per node average whole scan feature asd classification.the result reveal dynamic fc measure outperform comparable static fc measure predict asd
