 accumulator model prime target independent response activation rate basic equation average response time response priming task speed response perform toward target stimulus precede prime stimulus response slow error rate high prime target assign different response compare assignment response priming effect increase prime-target soa generalize vorberg et al 's accumulator model response priming response activation first control exclusively prime take actual target prim thus occur motor conflict response-inconsistent prime temporarily drive process towards incorrect response original model assume prime target signal identical strength allow different rate response activation cf mattler palmer schubert et al. model predict strong prime mainly increase prim effect response time error rate whereas strong target mainly diminish response time prim effect
