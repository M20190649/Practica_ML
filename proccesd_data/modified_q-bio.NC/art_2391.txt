 generate functionals guided self-organization time evolution equation dynamical system often derive generate functionals example newton 's equation motion classical dynamic generate within lagrange hamiltonian formalism propose generate functionals self-organizing complex system offer several advantage generate functionals allow formulate complex dynamical system systematically result obtain typically valid class complex system define type respective generating functionals generated dynamical system tend addition minimal contain free undetermined parameter point two generating functionals may use define complex system multiple generate function may combine single overall objective function provide discuss example term adapt neural network
