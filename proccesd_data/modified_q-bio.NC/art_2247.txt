 diffusion base modeling human brain response external stimulus human brain response overall ability brain analyze internal external stimulus form transferred energy mind brain phase-space thus make proper decision last decade scientist discover phenomenon propose model base computational biological neuropsychological method despite advance study relate area brain research less effort do mathematical modeling human brain response external stimulus research devote modeling human eeg signal alert state overall human brain activity monitoring due receive external stimulus base fractional diffusion equation result model show good agreement real human eeg signal thus model use strong representative human brain activity
