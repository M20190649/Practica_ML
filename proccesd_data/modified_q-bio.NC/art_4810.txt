 chaos-guided input structure improve learning recurrent neural network anatomical study demonstrate brain reformats input information generate reliable response perform computation however remain unclear neural circuit encode complex spatio-temporal pattern show neural dynamic strongly influence phase alignment input spontaneous chaotic activity input structure along dominant chaotic projection cause chaotic trajectory become stable channel attractor hence improve computational capability recurrent network use mean field analysis derive impact input structure overall stability attractor form result indicate input alignment determine extent intrinsic noise suppression hence alter attractor state stability thereby control network 's inference ability
