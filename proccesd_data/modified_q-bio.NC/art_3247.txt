 simple model low variability neural spike train neural noise set limit information transmission sensory system several area spike response repeat stimulus show high degree regularity predict poisson process however simple model explain low variability still lack introduce new model correction poisson statistic accurately predict regularity neural spike train response repeat stimulus model two parameter reproduce observed variability retinal recording various condition show analytically approximation work model spike emit process refractory period assume derive simple correction well approximate spike train statistic broad range fire rate model easily plug stimulus processing model like linear-nonlinear model generalization replace poisson spike train hypothesis commonly assume estimate amount information transmit much accurately poisson model retinal recording thanks simplicity model potential explain low variability area
