 technical report automatic contour extraction neuron image work describe novel methodology automatic contour extraction image neuron e.g camera lucida image type microscopy contour-based shape analysis method use characterize cell overlap neuronal process propose framework specifically aim problem contour follow even presence multiple overlap first input image preprocessed order obtain -connected skeleton one-pixel-wide branch well set critical region i.e. bifurcation crossing next subtree tracking stage iteratively label valid pixel branch critical region determine suitable direction proceed finally labeled skeleton segment follow order yield parametric contour neuronal shape analysis reported system successfully test respect several image result set three neuron image present pertain different class i.e alpha delta epsilon ganglion cell contain total crossing algorithm successfully get across overlap method also find exhibit robustness even image close parallel segment propose method robust may implement efficient manner introduction approach pave way systematic application contour-based shape analysis method neuronal morphology
