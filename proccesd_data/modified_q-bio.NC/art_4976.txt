 beta-rhythm oscillation synchronization transition network model izhikevich neuron effect topology synaptic type despite significant functional role beta-band oscillation least understood synchronization neuronal network attract much attention recent year main focus transition type whether one obtain explosive transition continuous transition important feature neuronal network depend network structure well synaptic type study consider effect synaptic interaction electrical chemical well structural connectivity synchronization transition network model izhikevich neuron spike regularly beta rhythm find wide range behavior include continuous transition explosive transition well lack global order strong electrical synapsis conducive synchronization even lead explosive synchronization key network element determine order transition find clustering coefficient small world effect existence hub network result contrast previous result use phase oscillator model kuramoto model furthermore show pattern synchronization change one go gamma band attribute change change refractory period izhikevich neuron change significantly frequency
