 motor control precisely time spike pattern fundamental problem neuroscience understand sequence action potential spike encode information sensory signal motor output although traditional theory neural coding assume information convey total number spike fire spike rate recent study sensory motor activity show far information carry millisecond-scale timing pattern action potential spike timing however unknown whether subtle difference spike timing drive difference perception behavior leave unclear whether information carry spike time actually play causal role brain function demonstrate precise spike timing code read downstream muscle control behavior provide correlative causal evidence show nervous system use millisecond-scale variation timing spike within multi-spike pattern regulate relatively simple behavior respiration bengalese finch songbird finding suggest fundamental assumption current theory motor cod require revision significant improvement application neural prosthetic device achieve use precise spike timing information
