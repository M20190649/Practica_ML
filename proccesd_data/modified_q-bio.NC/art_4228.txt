 sparse complex-valued representation natural sound learn phase amplitude continuity prior complex-valued sparse coding data representation employ dictionary two-dimensional subspace impose sparse factorial prior complex amplitude train dataset natural image patch learn phase invariant feature closely resemble receptive field complex cell visual cortex feature train natural sound however rarely reveal phase invariance capture aspect data observation start point present work first contribution provide analysis natural sound statistic mean learn sparse complex representation short speech interval secondly propose prior basis function set bias towards phase-invariant solution way dictionary complex basis function learn data statistic preserve phase invariance property finally representation train speech sound without prior compare prior-based basis function reveal performance comparable unconstrained sparse coding explicitely represent phase temporal shift representation find application many perceptual machine learning task
