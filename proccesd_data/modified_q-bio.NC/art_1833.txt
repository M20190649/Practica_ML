 repulsion induce attraction role ephrin-b retinotectal mapping study role ephb receptor ligand ephrin-b dorsal-ventral retinotopic mapping early study suggest ephrin-b act attractant ephb express axon address result recent experiment chick tectum mclaughlin et al. b axon retinal ganglion cell show repel high ephrin-b density thus propose ephrin-b might act attractant repellent show axonal behavior may follow attraction ephrin-b density axonal competition space therefore show apparent repulsive interaction induce combination attraction target competitive interaction axon suggest experimental test may distinguish repulsive interaction target repulsion induce attraction competition
