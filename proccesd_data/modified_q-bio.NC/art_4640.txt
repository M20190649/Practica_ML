 lfads latent factor analysis via dynamical system neuroscience experience data revolution many hundred thousand neuron record simultaneously currently little consensus data analyze introduce lfads latent factor analysis via dynamical system method infer latent dynamic simultaneously record single-trial high-dimensional neural spiking data lfads sequential model base variational auto-encoder make dynamical system hypothesis regard generation observed data lfads reduces observe spike set low-dimensional temporal factor per-trial initial condition infer input compare lfads exist method synthetic data show significantly out-performs infer neural firing rate latent dynamic
