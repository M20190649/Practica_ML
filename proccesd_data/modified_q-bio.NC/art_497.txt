 gating neural error signal motor learn cerebellar climb fiber activity encode performance error many motor learn task role error signal learning controversial compare two motor learn paradigm elicit equally robust putative error signal climb fiber learn increase decrease gain vestibulo-ocular reflex vor vor-increase training climb fiber activity one trial predict change cerebellar output next trial optogenetic activation climb fiber mimic encoding performance error sufficient implant motor memory contrast vor-decrease training trial-by-trial correlation climb fiber activity change cerebellar output climb fiber activation induce vor-decrease learning comparison two training paradigm suggest ability climb fiber induce plasticity dynamically gate vivo state cerebellar circuit even condition climbing fiber robustly activate performance error
