 classification fix point network dynamic multiple node timeseries data fix point network dynamic network encode stimuli via distinct output pattern although network omnipresent neural system structure typically unknown poorly characterize therefore valuable use supervised approach resolve network encode distinct input interest superposition input sample multiple node time series paper show accomplish task involve find low-dimensional state space supervise recording demonstrate standard method dimension reduction unable provide desired functionality optimal separation fixed point transient trajectory however combination dimension reduction selection optimization successfully provide functionality specifically propose two method exclusive threshold reduction etr optimal exclusive threshold reduction oetr find basis classification state space show classification space construct upon combination dimension reduction optimal separation directly facilitate recognition stimulus classify complex input mixtures similarity class test methodology compare standard state-of-the-art method benchmark dataset experimental neuronal network olfactory system record test method show method capable provide basis classification space network perform recognition significantly well rate previously propose approach
