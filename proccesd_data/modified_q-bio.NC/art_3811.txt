 role inhibitory feedback information processing thalamocortical circuit information transfer thalamus block dynamically sleep conjunction occurence spindle wave theoretical understanding mechanism remain incomplete analyze two modeling approach recent experiment le masson sl et al thalamocortical loop first step use conductance-based neuron model reproduce experiment computationally second step model system use extended hindmarsh-rose model compare result conductance-based model framework model investigate influence inhibitory feedback information transfer typical thalamocortical oscillator find extended hindmarsh-rose neuron model computationally less costly thus siutable large-scale simulation reproduce experiment good conductance-based model agreement experiment le masson sl et al inhibitory feedback lead stable self-sustained oscillation mask incoming input thereby reduce information transfer significantly
