 statistical physic neural system non-additive dendritic couple neuron process input crucially determine dynamic biological artificial neural network neural neural-like system synaptic input typically consider merely transmit linearly sublinearly dendritic compartment yet single-neuron experiment report pronounce supralinear dendritic summation sufficiently synchronous spatially close-by input provide statistical physic approach study impact non-additive dendritic processing single neuron response performance associative memory task artificial neural network first compute effect random input neuron incorporate nonlinear dendrite approach independent detail neuronal dynamic second use result study impact dendritic nonlinearities network dynamic paradigmatic model associative memory numerically analytically find dendritic nonlinearities maintain network convergence increase robustness memory performance noise interestingly intermediate number dendritic branch optimal memory functionality
