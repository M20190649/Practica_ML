 new class metric spike train distance pair spike train quantify difference measure use various metric introduce new class spike train metric inspire pompeiu-hausdorff distance compare exist metric new metric modulus-metric max-metric characteristic qualitatively different classical metric like van rossum distance victor purpura distance modulus-metric max-metric particularly suitable measure distance spike train information encode burst number timing spike inside burst carry information modulus-metric depend parameter compute use fast algorithm time depend linearly number spike two spike train also introduce localized version new metric could biologically-relevant interpretation measure difference spike train perceive particular moment time neuron receive spike train
