 brain temperature mean cognitive neuroscientist effect temperature various aspect neural activity single cell neural circuit level long know however temperature affect system-level activity typical experiment use non-invasive imaging technique magnetic brain imaging electroencephalography neither direct measurement manipulation possible essentially unknown start basic physical definition discuss possible way temperature may use parameter control evolution variable brain activity observe collective variable describe brain activity two aspect illustrate case learning-related brain activity finally method extract temperature experimental data review
