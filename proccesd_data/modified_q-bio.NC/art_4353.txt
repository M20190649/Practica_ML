 puzzle imaging use large-scale dimensionality reduction algorithm localization current high-resolution imaging technique require intact sample preserve spatial relationship present novel approach puzzle imaging allow image spatially scrambled sample technique take many spatially disordered sample piece back together use local property embed within sample show puzzle imaging efficiently produce high-resolution image use dimensionality reduction algorithm demonstrate theoretical capability puzzle imaging three biological scenario show relatively precise -dimensional brain imaging possible physical structure neural network often recover base neural connectivity matrix chemical map could reproduce use bacteria chemosensitive dna conjugative transfer ability reconstruct scrambled image promise enable image base dna sequencing homogenized tissue sample
