 two-part mixed-effects model framework analyze whole-brain network data whole-brain network analysis remain vanguard neuroimaging research come prominence within last decade network science approach facilitate analysis allow examine brain integrated system however statistical method model compare group network lag behind fuse multivariate statistical approach network science present best path develop method toward end propose two-part mixed-effects model framework allow model probability connection presence absence edge strength connection exist model within framework enable quantify relationship outcome e.g. disease status connectivity pattern brain reduce spurious correlation inclusion confound covariates also enable prediction outcome base connectivity structure vice versa simulate network gain good understanding normal range topological variability thresholding network leverage group information thus provide comprehensive approach study system level brain property understanding normal abnormal brain function
