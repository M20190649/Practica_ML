 task-driven intra- interarea communication primate cerebral cortex neural correlation cognitive task central study brain information processing computation however poorly analyze due difficulty record simultaneous single neuron task performance present work quantify neural directional correlation use spike train simultaneously record sensory premotor motor cortical area two monkey somatosensory discrimination task upon model spike train binary time series use nonparametric bayesian method estimate pairwise directional correlation many pair neuron throughout different stage task namely perception work memory decision making motor report find solve task involve feedforward feedback correlation path link sensory motor area certain task interval specifically information communicate task-driven neural correlation significantly delay across secondary somatosensory cortex premotor motor area decision making take place crucially sensory comparison longer request task performance major proportion directional correlation consistently vanish across cortical area
