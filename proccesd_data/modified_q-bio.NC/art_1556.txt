 interpret encode decode model encode decode model widely use system cognitive computational neuroscience make sense brain-activity data however interpretation result require care decode model help reveal whether particular information present brain region format decoder exploit encode model make comprehensive prediction representational space context sensory system encode model enable u test compare brain-computational model thus directly constrain computational theory encode decode model typically include fit linear-model component sometimes weight fitted linear combination interpret reflect encoding model contribution different sensory feature representation decoding model contribution different measure brain response decoded feature interpretation problematic predictor variable noise component correlate prior penalty use regularize fit encode decode model evaluate term generalization performance correct interpretation depend level generalization model achieve e.g new response measurement stimulus new stimulus population stimuli different population significant decoding encode performance single model whatever level generality provide strong constraint theory many model must test inferentially compare analysis drive theoretical progress
