 simulate leaky integrate fire neuron integer leaky integrate fire lif neuron represent standard neuronal model use numerical simulation leakage implement model exponential decay trans-membrane voltage towards rest value make inevitable usage machine float point number course simulation know machine float point arithmetic subject small inaccuracy prevent exact comparison float point quantity particular incorrect decide whether two separate time state simulated system compose lif neuron exactly identical however decision type necessary e.g figure periodic dynamical regime reverberating network offer simulation paradigm lif neuron neuronal state describe whole number within paradigm lif neuron behave exactly way standard float point simulate lif although exact comparison state becomes correctly define
