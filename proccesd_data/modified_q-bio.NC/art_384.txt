 generalize cable theory neuron complex heterogeneous medium cable theory develop last decade usually assume extracellular space around membrane perfect resistor however extracellular medium may display complex electrical property due various phenomenon polarization ionic diffusion capacitive effect impact cable property know paper generalize cable theory membrane embed arbitrarily complex extracellular medium outline generalize cable equation consider specific case simple case resistive medium case equation recover traditional cable equation show complex medium example presence ionic diffusion impact cable property voltage attenuation significant illustrate numerically always compare generalize cable traditional cable conclude nature intracellular extracellular medium may strong influence cable filtering well passive integrative property neuron
