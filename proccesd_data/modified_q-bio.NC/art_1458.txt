 identification k -inductively pierce code use toric ideal neural code binary code n focus one represent firing pattern type neuron call place cell much interest determine neural code realize collection convex set however draw representation convex set particularly number neuron code increase difficult nevertheless class code say k -inductively pierce k algorithm draw euler diagram use toric ideal code show sufficient condition code -inductively pierced may use exist algorithm draw realization code
