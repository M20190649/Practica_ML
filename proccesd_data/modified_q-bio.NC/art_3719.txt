 replica free evaluation neuronal population information mixed continuous discrete stimulus linear asymptotic regime recent study explore theoretically ability population neuron carry information set stimulus case purely discrete purely continuous stimulus case multidimensional continuous angular discrete correlate presence additional quenched disorder distribution analytical expression mutual information obtain limit large noise mean replica trick show result actually obtain case without use replica mean much simple expansion logarithm fit theoretical model real neuronal data show introduction correlation quenched disorder improve fit suggest possible role signal correlations-actually detect real data- redundant code show even difficult analysis asymptotic regime explicit expression mutual information obtain without resort replica trick despite presence quenched disorder gaussian realistic thresholded-gaussian model stimulus mixed continuous discrete find model information seem grow logarithmically infinity number neuron inverse noise even though exact general dependence derive explicitly thresholded gaussian model large noise limit low value information obtain thresholded-gaussian model fixed value noise population size contrary asymptotic regime low value noise low information value obtain gaussian model
