 data augmentation brain-computer interface analysis event-related potential data image data data augmentation become less relevant due large amount available training data regularization technique common approach move window crop scale affine distortion random noise elastic deformation electroencephalographic data lack sufficient training data still major issue suggest evaluate different approach generate augment data use temporal spatial rotational distortion result perception rare stimulus p data movement prediction mrcp data show approach feasible significantly increase performance signal processing chain brain-computer interface
