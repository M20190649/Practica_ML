 model contribution central versus peripheral vision scene object face recognition commonly believe central visual field important recognize object face peripheral region useful scene recognition however relative importance central versus peripheral information object scene face recognition unclear behavioral study larson loschky investigate question measure scene recognition accuracy function visual angle demonstrate peripheral vision indeed useful recognize scene central vision work model replicate result larson loschky use deep convolutional neural network fit data scene use model predict future data large-scale scene recognition well object face result suggest relative order importance use central visual field information face recognition object recognition scene recognition vice-versa peripheral information
