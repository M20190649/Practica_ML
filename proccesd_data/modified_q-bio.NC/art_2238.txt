 fractal-based correlation analysis rest state functional connectivity rat brain functional mri study functional connectivity do analyze brain 's hemodynamic response stimulation hand low-frequency spontaneous fluctuation blood oxygen level dependent bold signal functional mri observe resting state however bold signal rest state significantly corrupt huge noise arise cardiac pulsation respiration subject motion scanner forth especially noise compound strong rat brain human brain overcome artifact assume fractal behavior bold signal reflect low frequency neural activity apply theorem wavelet correlation spectrum long memory process scale-invariant low frequency scale report experiment show special correlation pattern correlation scale coefficient low-frequency band less hz also asymptotic wavelet correlation addition show distribution hurst exponent rat brain
