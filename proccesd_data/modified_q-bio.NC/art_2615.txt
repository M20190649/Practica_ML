 solitary electromechanical pulse lobster neuron investigation nerve activity focus predominantly electrical phenomenon nerve however thermodynamic system change temperature dimension nerve also observe action potential measurement heat change action potential suggest nerve pulse share many characteristic adiabatic pulse first experiment suggest small change nerve thickness length action potential finding lead suggestion action potential may relate electromechanical soliton travel without dissipation however modern attempt study mechanical phenomenon nerve present ultrasensitive afm recording mechanical change order aa giant axon lobster show nerve thickness change phase voltage change stimulate opposite end axon collide action potential pass one another annihilate observation consistent mechanical interpretation nervous impulse
