 face image statistic predict preferred spatial frequency human face processing psychophysical experiment suggest relative importance narrow band spatial frequency recognition face identity human exist however conclusive evidence frequency prefer address question examine amplitude spectrum large number face image observe face spectra generally fall steeper spatial frequency compare ordinary natural image external face feature like hair suppress whiten corresponding mean amplitude spectrum reveal high response amplitude spatial frequency deem important process face identity result present therefore provide support face process characteristic match correspond stimulus property
