 neuro-fuzzy model time-varying decision boundary recent study report result new decision make paradigm participant ask balance speed accuracy maximize total reward achieve experiment result computational modeling provide strong evidence suggest participant use time-varying decision boundary previous theoretical study optimal speed-accuracy trade-off suggest participant may learn use time-varying boundary maximize average reward rate result experiment however show participant use boundary even beginning experiment without prior experience task paper hypothesize boundary result use heuristic rule make decision task formulate decision making heuristic rule computational framework use fuzzy logic theory base theory propose new computational framework decision making evidence accumulation task framework explicit decision boundary instead subject 's desire stop accumulate evidence respond moment within trial give value accumulated evidence determine set fuzzy if-tehn rule use back-propagation method derive algorithm fit fuzzy model participant 's data investigate difference participant performance experiment reflect difference parameter fitted model
