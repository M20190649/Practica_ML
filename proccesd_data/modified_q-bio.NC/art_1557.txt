 static distributed-parameter circuit model explain electrical stimulation neuromuscular system finite element model fem widely use model electric field distribution study interaction stimulation electrode neural tissue however due insufficient computational capability represent neural tissue atom-level exist fem fails model real electric field perpendicular neuron membrane initiate action potential thus reveal real electrode-tissue interaction develop circuit model transmembrane voltage waveform show distributed-parameter circuit model systematically study electrode-tissue interaction affect electrode position input current waveform biological structure neuromuscular system model explains predict various phenomenon neuromuscular stimulation guide new stimulation electrode method design importantly facilitate fundamental understanding physical process electrode-tissue interaction model myelin assume inductive voltage waveform resonance cause inductive myelin account much low stimulation threshold activate motoneuron muscle fiber observe vivo measurement finding confirm feasibility study electrode-tissue interaction use proper distributed-parameter circuit current application neuromuscular system also raise possibility distributed-parameter circuit model could potentially apply study neural tissue include peripheral nervous system pns central nervous system cns
