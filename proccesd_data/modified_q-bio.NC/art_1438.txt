 color induction equiluminant flash stimulus color induction influence surround color inducer perceived color central region two different type color induction color contrast color central region shift away inducer color assimilation color shift towards color inducer several study effect use uniform striped surround report color contrast color assimilation respectively author kaneko murakami j vision study color induction use flash uniform surround report contrast high short flash duration extend work present new psychophysical result use flash static i.e. non-flashed equiluminant stimulus striped uniform surround similarly uniform surround stimulus observe color contrast obtain maximum contrast short m flash stimulus ms. observe maximum contrast red green lime inducer purple inducer obtain asymptotic profile along flash duration striped stimulus observe color assimilation static infinite flash duration red-green surround inducer red st inducer green nd inducer inducer configuration observe color contrast induction since work show non-equiluminant strip static stimulus induce color assimilation result also suggest luminance difference could key factor induce
