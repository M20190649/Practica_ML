 block facial mimicry selectively alter early stage facial expression process simulation model facial expression suggest posterior visual area brain area underpinning sensorimotor simulation might interact improve facial expression processing accord model facial mimicry may contribute visual perceptual processing facial expression influence early stage face processing thus play crucial role understand observed emotion aim present study assess whether early sensorimotor simulation influence face structural encode processing secondary aim investigate whether relationship alexithymic trait sensorimotor simulation mechanism fine facial expression discrimination order examine time-course face processing monitor p n component event-related potential erp participant perform fine discrimination task facial expression animal discrimination task implement control condition half experiment participant could freely use facial mimicry whereas half facial mimicry block gel result reveal p erp component modulate mimicry manipulation n amplitude large blocked mimicry condition compare free mimicry condition selectively face stimulus interestingly modulation interact alexithymic trait reduction n amplitude modulation function facial mimicry manipulation participant high level alexithymic trait result demonstrate sensorimotor simulation influence visual processing facial expression early stage participant high alexithymic trait tend underutilize sensorimotor simulation system
