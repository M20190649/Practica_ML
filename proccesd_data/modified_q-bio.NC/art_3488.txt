 swift two-sample test high-dimensional neural spike data understand neural network process information important investigate neural network dynamic varies respect different stimulus one challenge task design efficient statistical approach analyze multiple spike train data obtain short recording time base development high-dimensional statistical method able deal data whose dimension much large sample size however method often require statistically independent sample start neural data correlate consecutive sampling time bin develop approach pretreat neural data become independent sample time transfer correlation dynamic neuron different sampling time bin correlation dynamic among different dimension within sample time bin verify method use simulation data generate integrate-and-fire neuron network model large-scale network model primary visual cortex within short time e.g. second method may offer experimenter use advantage development statistical method analyze high-dimensional neural data
