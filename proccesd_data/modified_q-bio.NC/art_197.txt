 model thalamocortical cell impact ca channel distribution cell geometry fire pattern influence calcium channel distribution geometry thalamocortical cell upon tonic firing low threshold spike lts generation study -compartment model represent soma proximal distal dendrite well multi-compartment model use morphology real reconstructed neuron use uniform distribution ca channel determine minimal number low threshold voltage-activated calcium channel permeability require onset lts response hyperpolarizing current pulse -compartment model find channel distribution influence firing pattern range threshold value total t-channel density multi-compartmental model lts could generate unequally distribute t-channels compare minimal number equally distribute t-channels give channel density injected current tonic firing frequency find inversely proportional size cell however ca channel density elevate soma proximal dendrite amplitude lts response burst spike frequency determine ratio total threshold number t-channels cell specific geometry
