 increase functional entropy human brain age use entropy characterize intrinsic age property human brain analysis fmri data large dataset individual use rest state bold signal demonstrate functional entropy associate brain activity increase age average lifespan entropy calculate population individual increase approximately bit due correlation bold activity become widely distribute attribute number excitatory neuron excitatory conductance decrease age incorporate property computational model lead quantitatively similar result fmri data dataset involve male female find significant difference entropy male birth low female however entropy two sex increase different rate intersect approximately year age male large entropy
