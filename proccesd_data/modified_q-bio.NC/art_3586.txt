 mathematical study dynamic finite-size binary neural network review recent progress traditional mathematical approach study analytically dynamic neural network rely mean-field approximation rigorously applicable network infinite size however exist real biological network finite size many microscopic circuit invertebrate compose ten neuron thus important able extend small-size network ability study analytically neural dynamic analytical solution dynamic finite-size neural network remain elusive many decade powerful method statistical analysis central limit theorem law large number apply small network article critically review recent progress study dynamic small network compose binary neuron particular review mathematical technique develop study bifurcation network dynamic dualism neural activity membrane potential cross-neuron correlation pattern storage stochastic network finally highlight key challenge remain open future direction progress possible implication result neuroscience
