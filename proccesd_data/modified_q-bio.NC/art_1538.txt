 analysis structure dynamic three-neuron motif neural network identical neuron matrix connection weight completely describe network structure thereby determine process information however due non-linearity system clear similar microscopic connection structure also imply similar functional property network impact macroscopic structural quantity ratio excitatory inhibitory connection balance ratio non-zero connection density clarify question focus motif three binary neuron discrete ternary connection strength important class network building block analyze exhaustively develop new permutation-invariant metric quantify structural functional distance two give network motif use multidimensional scaling identify visualize cluster motif similar structural functional property comprehensive analysis reveals function neural network weakly correlate microscopic structure depend strongly balance connection
