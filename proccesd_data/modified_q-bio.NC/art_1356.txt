 chaos homeostatically regulated neural system low-dimensional yet rich dynamic often emerge brain example include oscillation chaotic dynamic sleep epilepsy voluntary movement however general mechanism emergence low dimensional dynamic remain elusive consider wilson-cowan network demonstrate numerical analytical work type homeostatic regulation network fire rate paradoxically lead rich dynamical repertoire dynamic include mixed-mode oscillation mixed-mode chaos chaotic synchronization true single recurrently couple node pair reciprocally couple node without self-coupling network couple experimentally determine weight derive functional magnetic resonance imaging data case stability homeostatic set point analytically determine approximate dynamic network level directly determine behavior single node system synchronization oscillatory non-oscillatory state result demonstrate rich dynamic preserve homeostatic regulation even cause homeostatic regulation
