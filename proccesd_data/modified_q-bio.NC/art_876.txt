 hierarchical neural representation dreamed object reveal brain decoding deep neural network feature dream generally think generate spontaneous brain activity sleep pattern common wake experience view support recent study demonstrate dreamed object predict brain activity sleep use statistical decoder train stimulus-induced brain activity however remain unclear whether visual image feature associate dreamed object represent brain study use deep neural network dnn model object recognition proxy hierarchical visual feature representation dnn feature dreamed object analyze brain decoding fmri data collect dreaming decoder first train stimulus-induced brain activity label feature value stimulus image multiple dnn layer decoder use decode dnn feature dream fmri data decoded feature compare averaged feature object category calculate large-scale image database find feature value decode dream fmri data positively correlate associate dreamed object category mid- high-level dnn layer use decoded feature dream object category could identify above-chance level match averaged feature candidate category result suggest dream recruit hierarchical visual feature representation associate object may support phenomenal aspect dream experience
