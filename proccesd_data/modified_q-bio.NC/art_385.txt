 direct coupling inhomogeneity assist neuron detect correlation low amplitude noise address question effect common stochastic input correlation spike train two neuron possibly nonidentical couple direct connection show change correlation low amplitude stochastic input well detect neuron connect direct excitatory coupling depend whether neuron identical slightly different symmetric asymmetric connection increase sensitivity system input correlation change mean slope correlation transfer function give range input correlation either case also optimum value synaptic strength maximize sensitivity system change input correlation
