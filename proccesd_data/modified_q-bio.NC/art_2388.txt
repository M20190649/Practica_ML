 chimera state network nonlocally couple hindmarsh-rose neuron model identify occurrence chimera state various couple scheme network two-dimensional three-dimensional hindmarsh-rose oscillator represent realistic model neuronal ensemble result together recent study multiple chimera state nonlocally couple fitzhugh-nagumo oscillator provide strong evidence phenomenon chimera may indeed relevant neuroscience application moreover work verify existence chimera state couple bistable element whereas date chimera know arise model possess single stable limit cycle finally identify interesting class mixed oscillatory state desynchronized neuron uniformly intersperse among remain one either stationary oscillate synchronized motion
