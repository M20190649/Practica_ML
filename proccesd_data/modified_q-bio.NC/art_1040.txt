 balance activation simple embodied neural simulation recent year many computational simulation spontaneous neural dynamic explore model spontaneous neural dynamic allow control virtual agent move simple environment setup generate interesting brain-environment feedback interaction rapidly destabilize neural behavioral dynamic suggest need homeostatic mechanism investigate role local homeostatic plasticity local inhibition adjust time balance excitatory input well macroscopic task negative activity compensate task positive sensory input regulate neural activity result behavior trajectory environment result suggest complementary functional role local homeostatic plasticity balanced activity across brain region maintain neural behavioral dynamic finding suggest important functional role homeostatic system maintain neural behavioral dynamic suggest novel functional role frequently report macroscopic task-negative pattern activity e.g. default mode network
