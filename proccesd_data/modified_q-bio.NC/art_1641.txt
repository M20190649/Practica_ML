 deep neural network model nonlinear compositionality neural representation human-object interaction visual scene understand often require processing human-object interaction seek explore well deep neural network dnn model capture feature similar brain 's representation human object interaction investigate brain region process human- object- interaction-specific information establish correspondence dnn feature result suggest infer selectivity region particular visual stimulus use dnn representation also map feature dnn region thus link dnn representation find specific part visual cortex particular result suggest typical dnn representation contain encode compositional information human-object interaction go beyond linear combination encoding two component thus suggest dnns may able model important property biological vision
