 conductance versus current noise neuronal model noisy subthreshold oscillation relate spike generation biological system notoriously noisy noise therefore also play important role many model neural impulse generation noise introduce realistic simulation also account cooperative effect noisy nonlinear dynamic often achieve simple noise term membrane equation current noise however ongoing discussion whether current noise justified whether rather conductance noise introduce closer natural origin noise therefore compare effect current conductance noise neuronal model subthreshold oscillation action potential generation see significant difference model behavior respect voltage trace tune curve interspike-intervals interval distribution frequency response noise strength adjust finding indicate simple current noise give reasonable result neuronal simulation regard physiological relevant noise effect
