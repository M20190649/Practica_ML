 power ratio interval map spiking model extracellular data describe new computationally simple method analyze dynamic neuronal spike train drive external stimulus goal method test prediction simple spike-generating model extracellularly record neuronal response new statistic call power ratio distinguish two broad class response response completely characterize variable firing rate example modulate poisson gamma spike train response fire rate variation alone sufficient characterize response dynamic example leaky integrate-and-fire spike train well poisson spike train long absolute refractory period show response many visual neuron cat retinal ganglion cat lateral geniculate nucleus macaque primary visual cortex fall second class imply pattern spike time carry significant information visual stimulus result also suggest spike train x-type retinal ganglion cell particular similar spike train generate leaky integrate-and-fire model additive stimulus-independent noise could represent background synaptic activity
