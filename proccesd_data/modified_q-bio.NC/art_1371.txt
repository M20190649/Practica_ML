 closed-loop control modular neuromorphic biohybrid neural network modularity major challenge development control circuit neural activity physiological limitation accessible region external stimulation possibly different functionally relevant one require complex indirect control design moreover control one region might affect activity downstream network sparse connection exist address question develop hybrid device cortical culture functionally integrate biomimetic hardware neural network design enable study modular network controllability connectivity well-defined key feature cortical network accessible use closed-loop control monitor activity coupled hybrid show module congruently modify macroscopic well microscopic activity level control impact efficiently activity side whether control circuit indirect series one implement independently one module hence result present global functional impact local control intervention overall strategy provide experimental access controllability neural activity irregularity embed modular organization
