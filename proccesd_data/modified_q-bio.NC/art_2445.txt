 efficient coding spectrotemporal binaural sound lead emergence auditory space representation date number study show receptive field shape early sensory neuron reproduce optimize cod efficiency natural stimulus ensemble still unresolved question whether efficient cod hypothesis explain formation neuron explicitly represent environmental feature different functional importance paper propose spatial selectivity high auditory neuron emerge direct consequence learn efficient code natural binaural sound firstly demonstrate linear efficient cod transform independent component analysis ica train spectrogram naturalistic simulated binaural sound extract spatial information present signal simple hierarchical ica extension allow decode sound position propose furthermore show unit reveal spatial selectivity learn binaural recording natural auditory scene case relatively small subpopulation learned spectrogram feature suffices perform accurate sound localization representation auditory space therefore learn purely unsupervised way maximize coding efficiency without task-specific constraint result imply efficient coding useful strategy learn structure allow make behaviorally vital inference environment
