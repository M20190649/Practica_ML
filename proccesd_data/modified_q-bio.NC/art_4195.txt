 shotgun sample solution common input problem neural connectivity inference infer connectivity neuronal network remain key challenge statistical neuroscience common input problem present major roadblock difficult reliably distinguish causal connection pair observed neuron correlation induce common input unobserved neuron since available record technique allow u sample small fraction large network simultaneously sufficient temporal resolution naive connectivity estimator neglect common input effect highly bias work propose shotgun experimental design observe multiple sub-networks briefly serial manner thus full network observe simultaneously give time may able observe entire experiment use generalized linear model spiking recurrent neural network develop scalable approximate bayesian method perform network inference give type data small fraction network observe time bin demonstrate simulation use method shotgun experimental design eliminate bias induce common input effect network thousand neuron small fraction neuron observe time bin could quickly accurately estimate performance improve exploit prior information probability connection two neuron dependence neuronal cell type e.g. dale 's law dependence distance neuron
