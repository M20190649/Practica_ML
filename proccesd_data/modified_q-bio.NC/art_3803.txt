 role chemical synapsis coupled neuron noise examine behavior presence noise array morris-lecar neuron couple via chemical synapsis special attention devote compare behavior good known case electrical couple arise via gap junction particular numerical simulation show chemical synapsis efficient gap junction enhance coherence optimal noise know array-enhanced coherence resonance case nonlinear chemical coupling observe substantial increase stochastic coherence system comparison linear electrical coupling interpret qualitative difference type couple arise fact chemical synapsis act presynaptic neuron spike whereas gap junction connect voltage two neuron time lead electrical coupling case large correlation interspike time interval detrimental array-enhanced coherence effect finally report existence system-size coherence resonance locally coupled system exhibit average membrane potential array
