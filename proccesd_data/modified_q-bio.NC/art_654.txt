 visual decision presence measurement stimulus correlation human animal base decision noisy sensory input much work therefore devote understand computation underly decision problem study variety task stimulus differ complexity however impact correlation sensory noise perceptual judgment well understood examine stimulus correlation together correlation sensory noise impact decision making example consider task detect presence single multiple target amongst distractors assume distractors observer 's measurement stimulus correlate computation optimal observer task nontrivial yet analyze understood intuitively find distractors strongly correlate measurement correlation strong impact performance distractor correlation weak measurement correlation little impact unless number stimulus large correlation neural response structure stimulus therefore strongly impact perceptual judgment
