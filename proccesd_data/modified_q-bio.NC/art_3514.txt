 control brain network dynamic across diverse scale space time human brain compose distinct region associate particular function distinct propensity control neural dynamic however relation function control profile poorly understood variation relation across diverse scale space time probe relation control dynamic brain network construct diffusion tensor image data large community base sample young adult specifically probe control property brain region investigate relationship dynamic across various spatial scale use laplacian eigenspectrum addition analysis regional modal controllability partitioning mode determine whether associate dynamic fast slow well whether alternate monotone find brain region facilitate control energetically easy transition associate activity short length scale slow time scale conversely brain region facilitate control difficult transition associate activity long length scale fast time scale build linear dynamical model result offer parsimonious explanation activity propagation network control profile support region differ neuroanatomical structure
