 synchronization protect noise synchronization phenomenon pervasive biology neuronal network mechanism synchronization extensively study physiological computational viewpoint functional role synchronization also attract much interest debate particular synchronization may allow distant site brain communicate cooperate therefore may play role temporal binding attention sensory-motor integration mechanism article study another role synchronization so-called collective enhancement precision argue full nonlinear dynamical context synchronization may help protect interconnected neuron influence random perturbation -- intrinsic neuronal noise -- affect neuron nervous system property may allow reliable computation carry even presence significant noise experimentally find e.g. retinal ganglion cell primate mathematically key obtain meaningful downstream signal whether term precisely-timed interaction temporal coding population coding frequency coding use stochastic contraction theory show synchronization nonlinear dynamical system help protect system random perturbation main contribution mathematical proof specific quantified condition impact noise individual system spatial mean essentially cancel synchronization similar concept may applicable question system biology
