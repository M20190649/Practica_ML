 energy information hodgkin-huxley neuron generation spike neuron energetically costly process evaluation metabolic energy require maintain signalling activity neuron challenge practical interest neuron model frequently use represent dynamic real neuron hardly ever evaluate electrochemical energy require maintain dynamic paper discuss interpretation hodgkin-huxley circuit energy model real biological neuron use evaluate consumption metabolic energy transmission information neuron couple electrical synapsis i.e gap junction show single postsynaptic neuron maximum energy efficiency measure bit mutual information per atp molecule consume require maximum energy consumption contrary group parallel postsynaptic neuron determine value synaptic conductance energy efficiency transmission present clear maximum relatively low value metabolic energy consumption contrary could expect best performance occur low energy cost
