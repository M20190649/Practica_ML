 sensory cod dynamically competitive network study insect olfactory processing indicate odor represent rich spatio-temporal pattern neural activity pattern difficult predict priori yet stimulus specific reliable upon repeat stimulation input formulate theoretical framework interpret experimental result propose paradigm dynamic competition '' inputs odor represent internally compete neural assembly pattern result dynamical motion within network involve winner '' among compete possibility model produce spatio-temporal pattern strong resemblance observe experimentally possess many general feature one desire pattern classifier large information capacity reliability specific response specific input reduced sensitivity initial condition influence noise form neural processing may thus describe organizational principle neural information processing sensory system go well beyond observation insect olfactory processing motivate development
