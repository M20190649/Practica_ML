 narrowband oscillation asynchronous neural activity investigate possibility narrowband oscillation may emerge completely asynchronous independent neural firing find population asynchronous neuron may produce narrowband oscillation neuron fire quasi-periodically deduce bound degree variability neural spike-timing permit emergence oscillation result suggest novel mechanism neural rhythmogenesis help explain recent experimental report large-amplitude local field potential oscillation absence neural spike-timing synchrony simply put although synchrony produce oscillation oscillation always imply existence synchrony
