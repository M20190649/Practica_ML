 spike onset dynamic response speed neuronal population recent study cortical neuron drive fluctuate current reveal cutoff frequency action potential encoding several hundred hz theoretical study biophysical neuron model predict much low cutoff frequency order average firing rate inverse membrane time constant biophysical origin observed high cutoff frequency thus well understood introduce neuron model dynamical action potential generation linear response analytically calculate uncorrelated synaptic noise find cutoff frequencies increase large value time scale action potential initiation become short
