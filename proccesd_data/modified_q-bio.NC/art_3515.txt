 convolution forget curve model repeat learn mathematic forgetting curve model fit well forget data learning condition one time rather repeat paper convolution model forget curve propose simulate memory process learning model memory ability i.e central procedure working memory model learn material i.e input working memory model regard system function input function respectively status forget i.e output working memory model regard output function convolution result memory ability learn material model apply simulate forgetting curve different situation result show model able simulate forget curve one time learn condition also multi-times condition model verify experiment mandarin tone learn japanese learner predicted curve fit well test point
