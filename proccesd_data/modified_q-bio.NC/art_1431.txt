 optimal stimulation protocol bistable synaptic consolidation model consolidation synaptic change response neural activity think fundamental memory maintenance timescale hour experiment synaptic consolidation induce repeatedly stimulate presynaptic neuron however effectiveness protocol depend crucially repetition frequency stimulation mechanism cause complex dependence unknown propose simple mathematical model allow u systematically study interaction stimulation protocol synaptic consolidation show existence optimal stimulation protocol model similarly ltp experiment repetition frequency stimulation play crucial role achieve consolidation result show complex dependence ltp stimulation frequency emerge naturally model satisfy minimal bistability requirement
