 spysort neuronal spike sort python extracellular recording multi-electrode array one basic tool contemporary neuroscience recording mostly use monitor activity understood sequence emitted action potential many individual neuron raw data produce extracellular recording commonly mixture activity several neuron order get activity individual contributing neuron pre-processing step call spike sorting require present pure python implementation well test spike sort procedure latter design modular way order favour smooth transition interactive sorting instance ipython automatic one surprisingly enough sadly enough depend one 's view point recode year old procedure python occasion major methodological improvement
