 deep gaze boosting saliency prediction feature map train imagenet recent result suggest state-of-the-art saliency model perform far optimal predict fixation lack performance attribute inability model influence high-level image feature object recent seminal advance apply deep neural network task like object recognition suggest able capture kind structure however enormous amount training data necessary train network make difficult apply directly saliency prediction present novel way reuse exist neural network pretrained task object recognition model fixation prediction use well-known network krizhevsky et al come new saliency model significantly outperform state-of-the-art model mit saliency benchmark show structure network allow new insight psychophysics fixation selection potentially neural implementation train network build recent work modeling saliency point process
