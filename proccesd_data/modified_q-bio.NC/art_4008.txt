 cortical current source connectivity mean partial coherence field important field research functional neuroimaging discovery integrated distributed brain system network whose different region need work unison normal functioning eeg non-invasive technique provide information massive connectivity analysis cortical signal time vary electric neuronal activity estimate eeg although technique high time resolution two cortical signal even distant location appear highly similar due low spatial resolution nature eeg study method eliminate effect common source due low spatial resolution present base efficient estimation whole-cortex partial coherence matrix use start point linear eeg tomography satisfy eeg forward equation show generalize partial coherence cortical grey matter current density time series invariant select tomography empirically show simulation experiment generalize partial coherence high spatial resolution classical coherence result demonstrate little electrode lag-connected brain region often miss misplace even lag coherence measure new method detects localize correctly connected region use lag partial coherence
