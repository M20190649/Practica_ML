 percolation-based thresholding method application functional connectivity analysis despite recent advance develop effective thresholding method convert weighted network unweighted counterpart still several limitation need address one limitation inability existing thresholding method take account topological property original weighted network binarization process could ultimately result unweighted network drastically different topological property original weighted network study propose new thresholding method base percolation theory address limitation performance propose method validate compare exist thresholding method use simulated real-world functional connectivity network brain comparison macroscopic microscopic property result unweighted network original weighted network suggest propose thresholding method successfully maintain topological property original weighted network
