 infer brain-computational mechanism model activity measurement high-resolution functional imaging provide increasingly rich measurement brain activity animal human major challenge leverage data gain insight brain 's computational mechanism first step define candidate brain-computational model bcms perform behavioural task question would like infer candidate bcms best account measure brain-activity data describe method complement bcm measurement model mm simulate way brain-activity measurement reflect neuronal activity e.g local average fmri voxels sparse sampling array recording result generative model bcm-mm produce simulate measurement order avoid fit mm predict individual measurement channel brain-activity data compare measure predict data level summary statistic describe novel particular implementation approach call probabilistic rsa prsa measurement model use representational dissimilarity matrix rdms summary statistic validate method simulation fmri measurement locally average voxels base deep convolutional neural network visual object recognition result indicate way measurement sample activity pattern strongly affect apparent representational dissimilarity however model measurement process account effect different bcms remain distinguishable even substantial noise prsa method enable u perform bayesian inference set bcms recognise data-generating model case
