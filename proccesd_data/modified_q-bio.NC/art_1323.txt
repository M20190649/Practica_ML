 quantum approach music cognition quantum cognition emerge important discipline mathematical psychology last two decade use abstract analogy mental phenomenon formal framework physical quantum theory quantum cognition demonstrate ability resolve several puzzle cognitive psychology quantum cognition essentially exploit idea projective hilbert space geometry quantum probability quantum similarity however many powerful tool provide physical quantum theory e.g. symmetry group utilize field quantum cognition research sofar inspire seminal work guerino mazzola symmetry tonal music study aim elucidate reconcile static dynamic tonal attraction phenomenon music psychology within quantum cognition framework base fundamental principle octave equivalence fifth similarity transposition symmetry tonal music reflect structure circle fifth develop different wave function description underlying tonal space present quantum model static dynamic tonal attraction compare traditional computational model musicology approach replicates also improve prediction base symbolic model music perception
