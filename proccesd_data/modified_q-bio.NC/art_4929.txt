 heterogeneous input central pattern generator shape insect gait previous work study interconnected bursting neuron model insect locomotion corresponding phase oscillator model high speed generate stable tripod gait three leg ground simultaneously swing low speed generate stable tetrapod gait two leg ground simultaneously swing however low speed several stable locomotion pattern typically observe insect gait may coexist present paper add heterogeneous external input oscillator modify bursting neuron model corresponding phase oscillator model produce one stable gait speed specifically unique stable tetrapod gait low speed unique stable tripod gait high speed unique branch stable transition gait connect suggest control signal originate brain central nervous system modify gait pattern
