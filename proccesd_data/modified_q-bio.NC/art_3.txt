 cod strategy monkey v inferior temporal cortex would like know whether statistic neuronal response vary across cortical area examine stimulus-elicited spike count response distribution v cortices awake monkey area distribution spike count stimulus well-described gaussian log variance spike count linearly relate log mean spike count two significant difference response characteristic find range spike count slope log variance vs. log mean regression large v however neuron two area transmit approximately amount information stimulus channel capacity maximum possible transmit information give noise response result suggest neuron v use variable signal large dynamic range neuron use less variable signal small dynamic range two coding strategy approximately effective transmit information
