 efficient method sample spike train network coupled neuron monte carlo approach recently propose quantify connectivity neuronal network key problem sample conditional distribution single neuronal spike train give activity neuron network dependency neuron usually relatively weak however temporal dependency within spike train single neuron typically strong paper develop several specialized metropolis -- hastings sampler take advantage dependency structure sampler base two idea adaptation fast forward -- backward algorithm theory hidden markov model take advantage local dependency inherent spike train first-order expansion conditional likelihood allow efficient exact sampling limit weak couple neuron also demonstrate sampler effectively incorporate side information particular noisy fluorescence observation context calcium-sensitive imaging experiment quantify efficiency sampler variety simulated experiment network parameter closely match data measure real cortical network also demonstrate sampler apply real calcium image data
