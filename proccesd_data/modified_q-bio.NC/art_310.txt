 retinal metric stimulus distance measure derive population neural responses ability organism distinguish various stimulus limit structure noise population code sensory neuron infer distance measure stimulus space directly recorded activity neuron salamander retina contrast previously use measure stimulus similarity neural metric tell u distinguishable pair stimulus clip retina give noise neural population response show retinal distance strongly deviate euclidean static metric yet simple structure identify stimulus feature neural population jointly sensitive show svm-like kernel function relate stimulus neural response space show non-euclidean nature retinal distance important consequence neural decoding
