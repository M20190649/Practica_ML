 predictive coding-based deep dynamic neural network visuomotor learn study present dynamic neural network model base predictive coding framework perceive predict dynamic visuo-proprioceptive pattern previous study show deep dynamic neural network model able coordinate visual perception action generation seamless manner current study extend previous model predictive coding framework endow model capability perceiving predict dynamic visuo-proprioceptive pattern well capability infer intention behind perceived visuomotor information minimize prediction error set synthetic experiment conduct robot learn imitate gesture another robot simulation environment experimental result show give intention state model able mentally simulate possible incoming dynamic visuo-proprioceptive pattern top-down process without input external environment moreover result highlight role minimize prediction error infer underlying intention perceived visuo-proprioceptive pattern support predictive coding account mirror neuron system result also reveal minimize prediction error one modality induce recall corresponding representation another modality acquire consolidative learning raw-level visuo-proprioceptive pattern
