 point singularity suprathreshold stochastic resonance optimal coding motivate recent study population cod theoretical neuroscience examine optimality recently describe form stochastic resonance know suprathreshold stochastic resonance occur population noisy threshold device model sensory neuron use mutual information measure show numerically random input signal optimal threshold distribution contain singularity large enough noise distribution consist single point hence optimal encoding realize suprathreshold stochastic resonance effect furthermore show bifurcational pattern appear optimal threshold setting noise intensity increase fisher information use examine behavior optimal threshold distribution population size approach infinity
