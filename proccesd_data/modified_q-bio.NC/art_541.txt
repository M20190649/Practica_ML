 induction slow oscillation rhythmic acoustic stimulation slow oscillation electrical potential oscillation spectral peak frequency sim hz hallmark electroencephalogram slow-wave sleep recent study indicate causal contribution slow oscillation consolidation memory slow-wave sleep raise question extent oscillation induce external stimulation examine whether slow oscillation effectively induce rhythmic acoustic stimulation human subject examine three condition tone present rate hz -hz stimulation ii tone present random sequence random stimulation iii tone present control condition sham stimulation start wakefulness sleep continue first sim min sleep compare two condition -hz stimulation significantly delay sleep onset however sleep establish -hz stimulation significantly increase entrain endogenous slow oscillation activity sleep -min period stimulation differ condition data show rhythmic acoustic stimulation use effectively enhance slow oscillation activity however effect depend brain state require presence stable non-rapid eye movement sleep
