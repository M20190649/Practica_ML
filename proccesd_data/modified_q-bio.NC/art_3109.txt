 wake-sleep algorithm recurrent spike neural network investigate recently propose model cortical computation perform relational inference consist several interconnect structurally equivalent population leaky integrate-and-fire lif neuron train self-organized fashion spike-timing dependent plasticity stdp despite robust learning dynamic model susceptible problem typical recurrent network use correlation base hebbian learning rule train high learn rate recurrent connection cause strong feedback loop network dynamic lead emergence attractor state cause strong reduction number representable pattern decay inference ability network solution introduce conceptually simple wake-sleep algorithm wake phase training execute normally sleep phase network dream sample generative model induce random input process allow u activate attractor state network unlearn effectively anti-hebbian mechanism algorithm allow u increase learn rate factor ten avoid clustering allow network learn several time faster also low learning rate cluster issue improve convergence speed reduce final inference error
