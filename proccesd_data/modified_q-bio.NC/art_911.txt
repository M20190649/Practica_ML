 axon initial segment require temporal precision action potential encoding neuronal population central neuron initiate action potential aps axon initial segment ai compartment characterize high concentration voltage-dependent ion channel specialized cytoskeletal anchor protein arrange regular nanoscale pattern although ai key evolutionary innovation neuron functional benefit confers clear use mutation ais cytoskeletal protein beta iv-spectrin establish vitro model neuron perturbed ais architecture retain nanoscale order lose ability maintain high nav density combine experiment simulation show high nav density ai require axonal ap initiation however crucial high bandwidth information encoding ap timing precision result provide first experimental demonstration axonal ap initiation without high axonal channel density suggest increase bandwidth neuronal code hence computational efficiency network function major benefit evolution ai
