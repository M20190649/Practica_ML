 connectivity dynamic neuronal network define shape individual neuron neuronal network constitute special class dynamical system form individual geometrical component namely neuron exist literature relatively little attention give influence neuron shape overall connectivity dynamic emerge network current work address issue consider simplified neuronal shape consist circular region soma axon spoke dendrite network grow place pattern randomly plane establish connection whenever piece dendrite fall inside axon several topological dynamical property result graph measure include degree distribution cluster coefficient symmetry connection size large connected component well three hierarchical measurement local topology vary number process individual basic pattern quantify relationship individual neuronal shape topological dynamical feature network integrate-and-fire dynamic network also investigate respect transient activation source node indicate long-range connection play important role propagation avalanche
