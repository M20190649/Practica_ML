 linear stability network pulse-coupled neuron first step towards comprehension neural activity one focus stability various dynamical state even characterization idealized regime perfectly periodic spike activity reveals unexpected difficulty paper discuss general approach linear stability pulse-coupled neural network generic phase-response curve post-synaptic response function particular present mean-field approach develop hypothesis infinite network small synaptic conductance ii microscopic approach apply finite large network result find matter large neural network response perturbation depend system size exist however also second class perturbation whose evolution typically cover increasingly wide range time scale analysis perfectly regular asynchronous state reveal stability depend crucially smoothness phase-response curve transmitted post-synaptic pulse general validity scenarion confirm numerical simulation system amenable perturbative approach
