 predict synchronous firing large neural population sequential recording major goal neuroscience understand population neuron code stimulus action number neuron record simultaneously increase fast pace case recording access complete population particular hard simultaneously record neuron type give area recent progress make possible profile record neuron give area thanks genetic physiological tool pool together recording neuron type across different experimental session however unclear infer activity full population neuron type sequential recording neural network exhibit collective behaviour e.g noise correlation synchronous activity directly capture conditionally-independent model would put together spike train sequential recording show infer activity full population retina ganglion cell sequential recording use novel method base copula distribution maximum entropy modeling spike response ganglion cell repeated stimulus pairwise recording could predict noise correlation use copula full activity large population ganglion cell type use maximum entropy modeling remarkably could generalize predict population responses different stimulus even different experiment could therefore use method construct large population merge cell response different experiment predict synchronous activity accurately show grow substantially number neuron approach promising way infer population activity sequential recording sensory area
