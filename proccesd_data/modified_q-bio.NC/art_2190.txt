 mean field description propagation chaos recurrent multipopulation network hodgkin-huxley fitzhugh-nagumo neuron derive mean-field equation arise limit network interact spike neuron number neuron go infinity neuron belong fixed number population represent either hodgkin-huxley model one simplified version fitzhugh-nagumo model synapsis neuron either electrical chemical network assume fully connect maximum conductance vary randomly condition neuron initial condition draw independently law depend population belong prove propagation chaos phenomenon take place namely mean-field limit finite number neuron become independent within population probability distribution probability distribution solution set implicit equation either nonlinear stochastic differential equation resemble mckean-vlasov equation non-local partial differential equation resemble mckean-vlasov-fokker- planck equation prove well-posedness equation i.e existence uniqueness solution also show result preliminary numerical experiment indicate mean-field equation good representation mean activity finite size network even modest size experiment also indicate mckean-vlasov-fokker- planck equation may good way understand mean-field dynamic e.g. bifurcation analysis
