 caenorhabditis elegans human connectome specific modular organisation increase metabolic functional developmental efficiency connectome entire connectivity neural system represent network range various scale synaptic connection individual neuron fibre tract connection brain region although modularity commonly show extensively study unclear whether connection specificity network already fully explain modularity alone answer question study two network neuronal network c. elegans fibre tract network human brain yield diffusion spectrum image dsi compare respective benchmark network vary modularities generate link swap desire modularity value otherwise maximally random find several network property specific neural network fully explain modularity alone first clustering coefficient characteristic path length c. elegans human connectomes high benchmark network similar modularity high cluster coefficient indicate efficient local information distribution high characteristic path length suggest reduce global integration second total wiring length small alternative configuration similar modularity due low dispersion connection mean neuron c. elegans connectome region interest roi human connectome reach few ganglion cortical area respectively third neural network show low algorithmic entropy compare alternative arrangement imply few rule need encode organisation neural system
