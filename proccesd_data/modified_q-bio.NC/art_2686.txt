 synapcountj -- tool analyze synaptic density neuron quantification synapsis instrumental measure evolution synaptic density neuron effect physiological condition neuronal disease even drug treatment however manual quantification synapsis tedious error-prone time-consuming subjective task therefore tool might automate process desirable paper present synapcountj imagej plugin measure synaptic density individual neuron obtain immunofluorescence technique also apply batch processing neuron obtain experiment use setting procedure quantify synapsis implement synapcountj base colocalization three image neuron neuron mark two antibody marker structure neuron inspire method come computational algebraic topology synapcountj provide procedure semi-automatically quantify number synapsis neuron culture result time require analysis greatly reduce
