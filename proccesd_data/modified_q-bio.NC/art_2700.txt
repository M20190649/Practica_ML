 computational evolution decision-making strategy research adaptive decision-making take strategy-first approach propose method solve problem examine whether implement brain environments succeed present method study strategy development base computational evolution take opposite approach allow strategy develop response decision-making environment via darwinian evolution apply approach dynamic decision-making problem artificial agent make decision source incoming information show complexity brain strategy evolved agent function environment develop difficult environment lead large brain information use result strategy resemble sequential sampling approach less difficult environment drive evolution toward small brain less information use result simple heuristic-like strategy
