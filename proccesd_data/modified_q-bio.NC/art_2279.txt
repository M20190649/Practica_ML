 hebbian crosstalk input segregation purpose previously propose hebbian adjustment incompletely synapse specific crosstalk might analogous genetic mutation analyze aspect effect crosstalk hebbian learning use classical oja model method previous work show crosstalk lead learning principal eigenvector ec input covariance matrix pre-multiplied error matrix describe crosstalk pattern find positive input correlation increase crosstalk smoothly degrade performance however oja model require negative input correlation account biological ocular segregation although assumption biologically somewhat implausible capture feature see complex model analyze crosstalk would affect segregation result show statistically unbiased input crosstalk induce bifurcation segregate non-segregating outcome critical value depend correlation also investigate behavior vicinity critical state weakly bias input conclusion result show crosstalk induce bifurcation special condition even simple hebbian model even low level crosstalk observe brain could prevent normal development however learn pairwise input statistic complex crosstalk-induced bifurcation may occur oja model bifurcation would analogous error catastrophe genetic model argue usually absent simple linear hebbian learning learning drive pairwise correlation
