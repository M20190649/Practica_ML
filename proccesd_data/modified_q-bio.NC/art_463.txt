 method neuronal source identification multi-sensor microelectrodes extracellular action potential recording significantly improve quality vivo record neuronal signal microelectrodes also instrumental localization neuronal signal source however exist neuron localization method mostly utilize vivo true neuron location remain unknown therefore method could experimentally validate article present experimental validation method capable estimate location intensity electrical signal source four-sensor microelectrode tetrode immerse saline solution use record stimulus pattern multiple intensity level generate stimulating electrode location tetrode vary respect stimulator location intensity stimulator estimate use multiple signal classification music algorithm result quantify comparison true value localization result accuracy precision micron micron respectively imply music resolve individual neuronal source similarly source intensity estimation indicate approach track change signal amplitude time together result suggest music use characterize neuronal signal source vivo
