 passenger 's active head tilt decrease severity carsickness effect head tilt severity motion sickness lateral acceleration environment objective investigate effect passenger head-tilt strategy severity carsickness lateral acceleration situation automobile background well know driver generally less susceptible carsickness passenger however also know driver tilt head toward curve center negotiate curve whereas passenger 's head move opposite direction therefore hypothesize head-tilt strategy effect reduce severity carsickness method passenger car drive quasi-oval track pylon slalom participant sat navigator seat experiment terminate either participant felt initial symptom motion sickness car finish lap natural head-tilt condition participant instruct sit naturally relax oppose lateral acceleration intentionally active head-tilt condition participant ask tilt head centrifugal acceleration thus imitate driver 's head tilt result number lap achieve active condition significantly great natural condition addition subjective rating motion sickness symptom active condition significantly low natural condition conclusion suggest active head tilt centrifugal acceleration reduce severity motion sickness application potential application study include development methodology reduce carsickness
