 convolutional neural network extra-classical receptive field convolutional neural network cnns great success many real-world application also use model visual processing brain however network quite brittle small change input image dramatically change network 's output prediction contrast know biology network largely rely feedforward connection ignore influence recurrent connection also focus supervise rather unsupervised learning address issue combine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation specialize unsupervised learning rule learn lateral connection neuron within convolutional neural network connection show optimally integrate information surround generate extra-classical receptive field neuron new propose model cnnex model optimal lateral connection robust noise achieve good performance noisy version mnist cifar- datasets resistance noise improve combine model additional regularization technique dropout weight decay although image statistic mnist cifar- differ greatly unsupervised learning rule generalize datasets result demonstrate potential usefulness combine supervise unsupervised learning technique suggest integration lateral connection convolutional neural network important area future research
