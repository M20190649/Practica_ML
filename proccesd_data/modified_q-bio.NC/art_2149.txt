 state sample dependence hopfield network inference fully connect hopfield network infer base observed magnetization pairwise correlation present system glassy phase low temperature high memory load find inference error sensitive form state sampling single state sample compute magnetization correlation inference error almost indistinguishable irrespective sampled state however error greatly reduce data collect state transition result hold different disorder sample account previously observe large fluctuation inference error low temperature
