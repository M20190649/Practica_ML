 subthreshold signal encoding coupled fitzhugh-nagumo neuron despite intensive research mechanism underlie neuron encode external input remain poorly understood recent work focus response single neuron weak subthreshold periodic signal simulate fitzhugh-nagumo stochastic model use symbolic method analyze firing activity neuron preferred infrequent spike pattern define relative timing spike detect whose probability encode information signal individual neuron isolation neuronal population responsible emergence complex behavior relevant question whether cod mechanism robust neuron isolate study second neuron perceive subthreshold signal affect detection encoding signal do first neuron simulation two coupled fitzhugh-nagumo neuron show coding mechanism indeed robust neuron perceive signal fire spike train symbolic pattern whose probability depend feature signal moreover show second neuron facilitate detection signal lower fire threshold first neuron turn decrease internal noise level need fire spike encode signal also show probability symbolic pattern achieve maximum minimum value period external signal close half mean firing period neuron
