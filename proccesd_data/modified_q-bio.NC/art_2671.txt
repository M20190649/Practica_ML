 noise-induced synchronization bidirectionally couple type-i neuron present study noise-induced order synchronous firing system bidirectionally couple generic type-i neuron find transition unsynchronized completely synchronized state occur beyond critical value noise strength clear functional dependence neuronal coupling strength input value inhibitory-excitatory ie synaptic coupling approach partially synchronized state show vary qualitatively depend whether input less critical value find introduction noise cause delay bifurcation firing pattern excitatory neuron ie coupling
