 stimulus-dependent suppression chaos recurrent neural network neuronal activity arises interaction ongoing fire generate spontaneously neural circuit response drive external stimulus use mean-field analysis ask neural network intrinsically generate chaotic pattern activity remain sensitive extrinsic input find input drive network response also actively suppress ongoing activity ultimately lead phase transition chaos completely eliminate critical input intensity phase transition non-monotonic function stimulus frequency reveal resonant frequency input effective suppress chaos even though power spectrum spontaneous activity peak zero fall exponentially prediction analysis variance neural response strongly suppress frequency match range many sensory system operate
