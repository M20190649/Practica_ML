 retinal adaptation invariance change higher-order stimulus statistic adaptation retina think optimize encoding natural light signal sequence spike send brain however adaptation also entail computational cost adaptive code intrinsically ambiguous output symbol trivially map back stimulus without knowledge adaptive state encode neuron thus important learn statistical change input invoke adaptive response ask reason potential limit adaptation measure ganglion cell response tiger salamander retina control change second contrast third skew fourth kurtosis moment light intensity distribution spatially uniform temporally independent stimulus skew kurtosis stimulus choose cover range observe natural scene quantify adaptation ganglion cell study two-dimensional linear-nonlinear model capture well retinal encoding property across stimulus find retinal ganglion cell adapt contrast exhibit remarkably invariant behavior change higher-order statistic finally theoretically analyze optimal coding ln-type model show neural code maintain high information rate without dynamic adaptation despite change stimulus skew kurtosis
