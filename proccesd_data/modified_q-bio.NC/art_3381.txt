 exact combinatorial inference brain image permutation test know exact test procedure statistic however often exact practice approximate method since small fraction every possible permutation generate even small sample size often require generate ten thousand permutation serious computational bottleneck paper propose novel combinatorial inference procedure enumerate possible permutation combinatorially without resampling propose method validate standard permutation test simulation study ground truth method apply twin dti study determine genetic contribution minimum spanning tree structural brain connectivity
