 long-term memory stabilize noise-induced rehearsal cortical network maintain memory decade despite short lifetime synaptic strength neural network store long-lasting memory unstable synapsis study effect random noise stability memory store synapsis attractor neural network model include ongoing spike timing dependent plasticity stdp show certain class stdp rule lead stabilization memory pattern store network stabilization result rehearsal induce noise show unstructured neural noise pass recurrent network weight carry imprint memory pattern temporal correlation certain condition stdp combine correlation lead reinforcement exist pattern even never explicitly visit thus unstructured neural noise stabilize exist structure synaptic connectivity finding may provide functional reason highly irregular spike display cortical neuron provide justification model system memory consolidation therefore propose irregular neural activity feature help cortical network maintain stable connection
