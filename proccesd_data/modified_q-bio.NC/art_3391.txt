 human peripheral blur optimal object recognition vision sharpest center gaze become progressively blurry periphery widely believe high foveal resolution evolve expense peripheral acuity sample scheme actually optimal object recognition test hypothesis train deep neural network 'foveated image high resolution near object increasingly sparse sample periphery neural network train use blur profile match human eye yield best performance compare shallower steeper blur profile even human categorization accuracy deteriorate steep blur profile thus blurry peripheral vision may evolve optimize object recognition rather merely due wire constraint
