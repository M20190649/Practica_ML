 active subthreshold dendritic conductance shape local field potential main contribution local field potential lfp think stem synaptic input neuron ensue subthreshold dendritic processing role active dendritic conductance shape lfp receive little attention even though ion channel know affect subthreshold neuron dynamic use modeling approach investigate effect subthreshold dendritic conductance lfp use biophysically detail experimentally constrain model cortical pyramidal neuron identify condition subthreshold active conductance major factor shape lfp find particularly hyperpolarization-activated inward current rm h sizable effect cause resonance lfp power spectral density get general qualitative understanding subthreshold active dendritic conductance cellular distribution affect lfp next perform systematic study simplified model find effect lfp pronounced synaptic drive cell asymmetrically distribute i.e. either basal apical active conductance distribute non-uniformly high channel density near synaptic input lfp measure opposite pole cell relative synaptic input summary show subthreshold active conductance strongly reflect lfp signal open possibility lfp use characterize property cellular distribution active conductance
