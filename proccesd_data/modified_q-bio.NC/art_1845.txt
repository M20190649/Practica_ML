 neural mechanism binaural pitch perception via ghost stochastic resonance present physiologically plausible binaural mechanism perception pitch complex sound via ghost stochastic resonance scheme two neuron drive noise different periodic signal frequency f kf f k f k output plus noise apply synaptically third neuron numerical result use morris-lecar neuron model chemical synapsis explicity consider show intermediate noise level enhance response third neuron frequency close f case previously describe ghost resonance case inharmonic combination input frequency shift amount df noise also see enhance response third neuron frequency fr also shift linearly df addition show similar resonance observe function synaptic time constant suggested ghost-resonance-based stochastic mechanism thus arise either peripheral level high level neural processing perception pitch
