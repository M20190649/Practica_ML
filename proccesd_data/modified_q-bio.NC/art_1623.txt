 odor estimation elimination olfactory system use response small number broadly sensitive receptor combinatorially encode vast number odor propose method decode distributed representation main idea receptor respond odor carry information receptor typical receptor bind many odorants response threshold signal absence odorants result easy identify odor rather odor demonstrate biologically realistic number receptor response function odor mixture complexity remarkably simple method elimination turn underdetermined decoding problem overdetermined one allow accurate determination odorants mixture concentration give simple neural network realization algorithm resemble circuit architecture piriform cortex propose experimental test
