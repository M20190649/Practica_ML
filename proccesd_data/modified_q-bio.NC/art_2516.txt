 efficacy high frequency switched-mode stimulation activate purkinje cell paper investigate efficacy high frequency switched-mode neural stimulation instead use constant stimulation amplitude stimulus switch repeatedly high frequency khz duty cycled signal mean tissue model include dynamic property tissue material well axon membrane first show switched-mode stimulation depolarize cell membrane similar way classical constant amplitude stimulation finding subsequently verify use vitro experiment response purkinje cell measure due stimulation signal molecular layer cerebellum mouse purpose stimulator circuit develop able produce monophasic high frequency switched-mode stimulation signal result confirm modeling show switched-mode stimulation able induce similar response purkinje cell classical stimulation use constant current source conclusion open possibility novel stimulation design improve performance stimulator circuitry care take avoid loss system due high operating frequency
