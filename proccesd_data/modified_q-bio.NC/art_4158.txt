 autonomous search diffusive source unknown environment paper present approach olfactory search diffusive emit source tracer e.g aerosol gas environment unknown map randomly place shape obstacle measurement tracer concentration sporadic noisy without directional information search domain discretised model finite two-dimensional lattice link lattice represent traversable path emitted particle searcher miss link lattice indicate blocked path due wall obstacle searcher must simultaneously estimate source parameter map search domain location within map solution formulate sequential bayesian framework implement rao-blackwellised particle filter information-driven motion control numerical result demonstrate concept performance
