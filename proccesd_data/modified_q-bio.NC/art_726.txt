 brain use reliability stimulus information make perceptual decision simple perceptual decision brain identify stimulus base noisy sensory sample stimulus basic statistical consideration state reliability stimulus information i.e. amount noise sample take account decision make however perceptual decision make experiment question whether brain indeed use reliability make decision confront unpredictable change stimulus reliability show even basic drift diffusion model frequently use explain experimental finding perceptual decision making implicitly rely estimate stimulus reliability show variant drift diffusion model allow stimulus-specific reliability consistent neurophysiological finding analysis suggest brain estimate reliability stimulus short time scale hundred millisecond
