 ampa nmda gabaa receptor mediate network burst dynamic cortical culture vitro work study excitatory ampa nmda inhibitory gabaa receptor mediate dynamical change neuronal network neonatal rat cortex vitro extracellular network-wide activity record planar electrode simultaneously different pharmacological condition analyze change overall network activity network-wide burst frequency baseline ampa receptor ampa-r nmda receptor nmda-r driven activity well latter state disinhibited activity additionally spatiotemporal structure pharmacologically modify burst recruitment electrode network burst study result show ampa-r nmda-r receptor clearly distinct role network dynamic ampa-rs great charge initiate network wide burst therefore nmda-rs maintain already initiated activity gabaa receptor gabaa-rs inhibit ampa-r driven network activity strongly nmda-r driven activity burst
