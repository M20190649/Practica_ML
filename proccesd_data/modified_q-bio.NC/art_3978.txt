 neural dynamic parkinsonian brain boundary synchronize nonsynchronized dynamic synchronous oscillatory dynamic frequently observe human brain analyze fine temporal structure phase-locking realistic network model match experimental data parkinsonian patient show experimentally observed intermittent synchrony generate moderately increase couple strength basal ganglia circuit due lack dopamine comparison experimental model data suggest brain activity parkinson 's disease reside large boundary region synchronize nonsynchronized dynamic edge synchrony may allow easy formation transient neuronal assembly
