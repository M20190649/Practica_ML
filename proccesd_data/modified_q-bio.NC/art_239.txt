 neuronal response clamp since first recording make evoked action potential become apparent response individual neuron ongoing physiologically relevant input highly variable variability manifest non-stationary behavior practically every observable neuronal response feature introduce neuronal response clamp closed-loop technique enable full control two important single neuron activity variable response probability stimulus-spike latency technique applicable extended duration several hour effective even background ongoing neuronal network activity response clamp technique powerful tool extend voltage-clamp dynamic-clamp approach neuron 's functional level namely spike behavior
