 frequency phase synchronization two coupled neuron channel noise study frequency phase synchronization two coupled identical nonidentical neuron channel noise occupation number method use model neuron context stochastic hodgkin-huxley model strength channel noise represent ion channel cluster size initiation region neuron show frequency synchronization achieve arbitrary value couple strength long two neuron channel cluster size also show relative phase neuron display profuse dynamic behavior combined action coupling channel noise qualitative quantitative description apply describe transition behavior relevance finding control neural synchronization experimentally discuss
