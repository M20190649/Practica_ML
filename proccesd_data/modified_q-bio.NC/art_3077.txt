 theoretical connection noisy leaky integrate-and-fire escape rate model non-autonomous case one important challenge mathematical neuroscience properly illustrate stochastic nature neuron among different approach noisy leaky integrate-and-fire escape rate model probably popular two model usually choose express different noise action neural cell paper investigate link two formalism case neuron subject time dependent input aim introduce new general stochastic framework shall prove general framework entail two already exist one result theoretical implication since offer general view upon two stochastic process mostly use neuroscience upon way link explain observed statistical similarity
