 impact triplet correlation neural population code statistical feature spike activity matter stimulus encode neural population vast body work explore firing rate individual cell correlation spike cell pair impact coding little know higher-order correlation describe simultaneous firing triplet large ensemble cell impact encode stimulus information take first step toward close gap vary triplet correlation small cell neural population keep single cell pairwise statistic fix typically report value value triplet correlation estimate performance neural population two-stimulus discrimination task identify predominant way triplet correlation strongly enhance coding triplet correlation differ two stimulus skew response distribution two stimulus apart separate make easy distinguish coding benefit occur stimulus elicit similar triplet correlation result indicate higher-order correlation could strong effect population coding finally calculate many sample necessary accurately measure spike correlation type provide estimate necessary recording time experiment
