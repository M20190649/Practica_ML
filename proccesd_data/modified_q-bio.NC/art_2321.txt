 input nonlinearities shape beyond-pairwise correlation improve information transmission neural population recent recording neural population show beyond-pairwise higher-order correlation hoc little understanding hoc arise network interaction impact encoded information show input nonlinearities imply hoc spin-glass-type statistical model discuss one model parameterized pairwise- higher-order interaction reveal condition beyond-pairwise interaction increase mutual information give stimulus type population response jointly gaussian stimulus cod performance improve shape output hoc neural firing rate constrain low stimulus skewed probability distribution like natural image luminance performance improves firing rate work suggest surprising connection nonlinear integration neural input stimulus statistic normative theory population coding moreover suggest inclusion beyond-pairwise interaction could improve performance boltzmann machine machine learning signal processing application
