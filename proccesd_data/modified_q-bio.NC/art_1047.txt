 novel method link neural connectivity behavioral fluctuation behavior-regressed connectivity background experimental session behavioral performance fluctuates yet neuroimaging analysis functional connectivity derive single connectivity pattern conventional connectivity approach assume since underlie behavior task remain constant connectivity pattern also constant new method introduce novel method behavior-regressed connectivity brc directly examine behavioral fluctuation within experimental session capture relationship change functional connectivity method employ weighted phase lag index wpli apply window trial weight function use two datasets brc result compare conventional connectivity result two time window one second stimulus onset identify predictive relationship one second onset capture task-dependent relationship result task replicate expected result conventional connectivity analysis extend understanding brain-behavior relationship use brc analysis demonstrate subject-specific connectivity pattern correspond positive negative relationship behavior comparison exist method conventional connectivity analyse assume consistent relationship behavior functional connectivity brc method examines performance variability within experimental session understand dynamic connectivity transient behavior conclusion brc approach examine connectivity covaries behavior complement knowledge underlying neural activity derive conventional connectivity analysis within framework brc may implement purpose understanding performance variability within participant
