 super-resolution use sparse representation learned dictionary reconstruction brain structure use electron microscopy central problem neuroscience reconstruct neuronal circuit synapse level due wide range scale brain architecture reconstruction require image high-resolution high-throughput exist electron microscopy em technique posse require resolution lateral plane either high-throughput high depth resolution exploit recent advance unsupervised learning signal processing obtain high depth-resolution em image computationally without sacrifice throughput first show brain tissue represent sparse linear combination localized basis function learn use high-resolution datasets develop compressive sensing-inspired technique reconstruct brain tissue typically tomographic view section enable trace neuronal process hence high throughput reconstruction neural circuit level individual synapsis
