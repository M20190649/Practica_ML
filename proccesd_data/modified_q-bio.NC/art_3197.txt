 balance excitation inhibition determines f power spectrum neuronal network f -like decay observe power spectrum electro-physiological signal along scale-free statistic so-called neuronal avalanche constitute evidence criticality neuronal system recent vitro study show avalanche dynamic criticality corresponds specific balance excitation inhibition thus suggest basic feature critical state neuronal network particular lack inhibition significantly alter temporal structure spontaneous avalanche activity lead anomalous abundance large avalanche study relationship network inhibition scaling exponent beta power spectral density psd avalanche activity neuronal network model inspire self-organized criticality soc find scaling exponent depend percentage inhibitory synapsis tend value beta percentage specifically beta close namely brownian noise purely excitatory network decrease towards value interval percentage inhibitory synapsis range agreement experimental finding result indicate level inhibition affect frequency spectrum rest brain activity suggest analysis psd scale behavior possible tool study pathological condition
