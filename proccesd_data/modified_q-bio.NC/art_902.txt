 functional connectomics data probabilistic graphical model neuronal network c. elegans propose data-driven approach represent neuronal network dynamic probabilistic graphical model pgm approach learn pgm structure employ dimension reduction network response dynamic evoke stimulus apply neuron separately outcome model capture stimuli propagate network thus represent functional dependency neuron i.e. functional connectome benefit use pgm functional connectome posterior inference do efficiently circumvent complexity direct inference response pathway dynamic neuronal network particular posterior inference reveal relation know stimulus downstream neuron allow query stimulus associate downstream neuron validation example approach apply methodology model caenorhabiditis elegans nervous system structure dynamic well-studied dynamical model collect time series network response use singular value decomposition obtain low-dimensional projection time series data extract dominant pattern data matrix get pairwise dependency information create graphical model full somatic nervous system pgm enable u obtain verify underlying neuronal pathway dominant know behavioral scenario detect possible pathway novel scenario
