 transmission information active network shannon 's capacity theorem main concept behind theory communication say amount information contain signal small channel capacity physical medium communication transmit arbitrarily small probability error theorem usually applicable ideal channel communication information transmit alter passive characteristic channel basically try reproduce source information active channel network form element dynamical system neuron chaotic periodic oscillator unclear theorem applicable active channel adapt input signal alter capacity shed light matter show among result calculate information capacity active channel communication show channel capacity depend whether active channel self-excitable contrary current belief desynchronization provide environment large amount information transmit channel self-excitable interesting case self-excitable active channel network electrically connect hindmarsh-rose chaotic neuron
