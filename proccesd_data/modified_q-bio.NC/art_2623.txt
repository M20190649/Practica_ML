 existence travel wave neural model g. b. ermentrout j. b. mcleod publish landmark study travel wave front differential-integral equation model neural network since number author extend model add additional equation recovery variable thus allow possibility travel pulse type solution recent paper g. faye give perhaps first rigorous proof existence stability travel pulse solution model excitatory weight function j use work allow system reduce set four coupled ode specific firing rate function parameter consider method geometric singular perturbation employ together blow-ups paper keep j extend faye 's work obtain fast slow wave remove faye 's hypothesis wave pass knee also consider general set function use standard ode method
