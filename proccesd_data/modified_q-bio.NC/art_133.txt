 effect hebbian learn dynamic structure random network inhibitory excitatory neuron aim present paper study effect hebbian learning random recurrent neural network biological connectivity i.e sparse connection separate population excitatory inhibitory neuron furthermore consider neuron dynamic may occur short time scale synaptic plasticity consider possibility learn rule passive forgetting show application hebbian learn lead drastic change network dynamic structure particular learning rule contract norm weight matrix yield rapid decay dynamic complexity entropy word network rewire hebbian learn new synaptic structure emerge learn basis correlation progressively build neuron also observe within emerge structure strong synapsis organize small-world network second effect decay weight matrix spectral radius consist rapid contraction spectral radius jacobian matrix drive system edge chaos '' sensitivity input pattern maximal take together scenario remarkably predict theoretical argument derive dynamical system graph theory
