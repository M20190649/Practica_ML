 probabilistic synapsis learn especially rapid learning critical survival however learn hard large number synaptic weight must set base noisy often ambiguous sensory information high-noise regime keep track probability distribution weight point estimate optimal strategy hypothesize synapsis take optimal strategy store mean weight also store degree uncertainty essence put error bar weight use uncertainty adjust learning rate high uncertainty result high learning rate also make second independent hypothesis synapsis communicate uncertainty link variability uncertainty lead variability concretely value synaptic weight give time sample probability distribution two hypothesis cast synaptic plasticity problem bayesian inference thus provide normative view learning consistent known learning rule offer explanation large variability size post-synaptic potential make several falsifiable experimental prediction
