 reveal network connectivity dynamic present method infer network connectivity collective dynamic network synchronize phase oscillator study long-term stationary response temporally constant driving give driving condition measure phase difference collective frequency reveals information oscillator interconnect sufficiently many repetition different driving condition yield entire network connectivity measure dynamic sparsely connect network obtain good prediction actual connectivity even formally under-determined problem
