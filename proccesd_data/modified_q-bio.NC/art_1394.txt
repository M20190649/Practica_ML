 cochlear detection double-slip motion cello bow double-slip motion cello sound investigate experimentally bowing machine analyze use finite-difference time domain fdtd cochlear model double-slip sound investigate sawtooth motion normal bowing basically present within period bow hair tear string within period result blurred sound additional intermediate slip appear around middle period drift temporally around sound progress double-slip perfectly middle one period sound regular sawtooth motion two periodicity present around double fundamental periodicity make sound arbitrary analyze sound wavelet-transform expected double-peak two periodicity around second partial find analyze tone cochlear fdtd model include transfer mechanical energy spike doubling even complex behaviour perfectly represent interspike interval isi two adjacent spike cochlear spike representation fit perfectly amplitude peak detection algorithm track precise time point double-slip within fundamental period therefore ear able detect double-slip motion right transition basilar membrane motion electrical spike
