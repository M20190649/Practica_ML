 predict category attribute visual search target use deep gaze pool predict target visual search eye fixation gaze data challenge problem many application human-computer interaction contrast previous work focus individual instance search target propose first approach predict category attribute search target base gaze data however state art model categorical recognition general require large amount training data prohibitive gaze data address challenge propose novel gaze pool layer integrate gaze information cnn-based architecture attention mechanism incorporate spatial temporal aspect human gaze behavior show approach effective even gaze pool layer add already trained cnn thus eliminate need expensive joint data collection visual gaze data propose experimental setup data set demonstrate effectiveness method search target prediction base gaze behavior study integrate temporal spatial gaze information effectively indicate direction future research gaze-based prediction mental state
