 statistical physic pairwise probability model statistical model describe probability distribution state biological system commonly use dimensional reduction among model pairwise model attractive part fit use reasonable amount data knowledge mean correlation pair element system sufficient surprisingly use pairwise model study neural data focus many study recent year paper describe tool statistical physic employ study use pairwise model build previous work subject study relation different method fit model evaluate quality particular use data simulated cortical network study quality various approximate method infer parameter pairwise model depend time bin choose bin data also study effect size time bin model quality use simulate data show use fine time bin increase quality pairwise model offer new way derive expression report previous work assess quality pairwise model
