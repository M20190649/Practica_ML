 novel phase portrait understand neuronal excitability fifty year ago fitzugh introduce phase portrait become famous twofold reason capture physiological way qualitative behavior hodgkin-huxley model reveal power simple dynamical model unfold complex firing pattern date spite enormous progress qualitative quantitative neural modeling phase portrait remain core picture neuronal excitability yet major difference neurophysiology recognition prominent role calcium channel fire mechanism show include extra current hodgkin-huxley dynamic lead revision fitzugh-nagumo phase portrait affect fundamental way reduced modeling neural excitability revisited model considerably enlarge model power original one particular capture essential electrophysiological signature otherwise require non-physiological alteration considerable complexication classical model basic illustration new model show highlight core dynamical mechanism calcium conductance control two distinct fire mode thalamocortical neuron
