 connectomic constraint computation feedforward network spike neuron several effort currently underway decipher connectome part thereof variety organism ascertain detailed physiological property neuron connectomes however scope project therefore unclear extent knowledge connectome alone advance mechanistic understanding computation occur neural circuit especially high-level function say circuit unknown consider question wiring diagram neuron imposes constraint neural circuit compute assume detailed information physiological response property neuron call constraint -- arise virtue connectome -- connectomic constraint computation feedforward network equip neuron obey deterministic spiking neuron model satisfy small number property ask know architecture network rule computation could matter response property neuron may show result form certain class network architecture hand also prove limited set property assume model neuron fundamental limit constraint impose network structure thus theory suggest connectomic constraint might restrict computational ability certain class network architecture may require elaborate information property neuron network discern result class network
