 complexity without chaos plasticity within random recurrent network generate robust timing motor control widely accept complex dynamic characteristic recurrent neural circuit contributes fundamental manner brain function progress slow understand exploit computational power recurrent dynamic two main reason nonlinear recurrent network often exhibit chaotic behavior known learning rule work robust fashion recurrent network address problem demonstrate random recurrent network rrn initially exhibit chaotic dynamic tune supervised learning rule generate locally stable neural pattern activity complex robust noise outcome novel neural network regime exhibit transiently stable chaotic trajectory show recurrent learning rule dramatically increase ability rrns generate complex spatiotemporal motor pattern account recent experimental data show decrease neural variability response stimulus onset
