 predict non-linear dynamic stable local learning recurrent spike neural network brain need predict body react motor command open question network spike neuron learn reproduce non-linear body dynamic cause motor command use local online stable learning rule present supervised learning scheme feedforward recurrent connection network heterogeneous spike neuron error output feed back fix random connection negative gain cause network follow desired dynamic online local rule change weight rule feedback-based online local learning weight follow local sense weight change depend presynaptic activity error signal project onto postsynaptic neuron provide example learn linear non-linear chaotic dynamic well dynamic two-link arm use lyapunov method reasonable assumption approximation show follow learning stable uniformly error go zero asymptotically
