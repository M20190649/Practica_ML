 bursty persistent property large-scale brain network reveal point-based method dynamic functional connectivity paper present novel versatile method study dynamic resting-state fmri brain connectivity high temporal sensitivity whereas existing method often rely divide time-series large segment data i.e call slide window technique point-based method pbm propose provide estimate brain connectivity level individual sample time-points achieved increase temporal sensitivity together temporal graph network theory allow u study functional integration well within resting-state network result show functional integration two resting-state network predominately occur burst activity intermittent period less connectivity whereas functional connectivity within resting-state network characterize tonic periodic connectivity pattern moreover point-based approach allow u estimate persistency brain connectivity i.e duration intrinsic trace memory resting-state connectivity pattern described point-based method dynamic resting-state functional connectivity allow detailed expanded view temporal dynamic resting-state connectivity provide novel insight neuronal information processing integrate human brain level large-scale network
