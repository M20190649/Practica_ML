 dendritic cortical microcircuit approximate backpropagation algorithm deep learning see remarkable development last year many inspire neuroscience however main learning mechanism behind advance error backpropagation appear odds neurobiology introduce multilayer neuronal network model simplify dendritic compartment error-driven synaptic plasticity adapt network towards global desire output contrast previous work model require separate phase synaptic learning drive local dendritic prediction error continuously time error originate apical dendrite occur due mismatch predictive input lateral interneurons activity actual top-down feedback use simple dendritic compartment different cell-types model represent error normal activity within pyramidal neuron demonstrate learning capability model regression classification task show analytically approximate error backpropagation algorithm moreover framework consistent recent observation learn brain area architecture cortical microcircuit overall introduce novel view learn dendritic cortical circuit brain may solve long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem
