 mean-field dynamic random neural network noise consider network randomly couple rate-based neuron influence external internal noise derive second-order stochastic mean-field model network dynamic use analyze stability bifurcation thermodynamic limit well study fluctuation due finite-size effect demonstrate two type noise substantially different impact network dynamic source noise give rise stochastic fluctuation case finite-size network external noise affect stationary activity level network thermodynamic limit.we compare theoretical prediction direct simulation result show agree large enough network size parameter domain sufficiently away bifurcation
