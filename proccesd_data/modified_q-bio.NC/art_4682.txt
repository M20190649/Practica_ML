 decode epileptogenesis reduced state space describe recent result multidisciplinary effort design biomarker actively continuously decode progressive change neuronal organization lead epilepsy process know epileptogenesis use animal model acquire epilepsy wechronically record hippocampal evoke potential elicit auditory stimulus use set reduced coordinate algorithm identify universal smooth low-dimensional configuration auditory evoke potential correspond distinct stage epileptogenesis use hidden markov model learn dynamic evoked potential evolve along smooth low-dimensional subset provide experimental evidence biomarker able exploit subtle change evoked potential reliably decode stage epileptogenesis predict whether animal eventually recover injury develop spontaneous seizure
