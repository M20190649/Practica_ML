 new fmri data analysis method use cross validation negative bold response may deactivation interneurons although functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri widely use study brain function blood oxygenation level dependent bold effect incompletely understood particularly negative bold response nbrs controversial paper present new fmri data analysis method accurate typical conventional method author conduct experiment simple repetition analyze data new method result strongly suggest deactivation nbrs detect new method deactivation interneurons deactivation ratio obtain new method approximately equal deactivation ratio interneurons obtain study interneurons de activation detect new method largely different detect conventional method new method accurate conventional method therefore de activation detect new method may correct de activation detect conventional method may incorrect large portion deactivation inhibitory interneurons also consider activation therefore right-tailed t-test usually perform conventional method detect whole activation right-tailed t-test detect activation excitatory neuron neglect deactivation inhibitory interneurons lot fmri study far conventional method re-examine new method many result obtain far modify
