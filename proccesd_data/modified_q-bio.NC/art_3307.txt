 effective connectivity single trial fmri data sample biologically plausible model estimation causal network architecture brain fundamental understand cognitive information process however access dynamic process underlie cognition limit indirect measurement hidden neuronal activity instance fmri data thus estimate network structure underlying process challenge article embed adaptive importance sampler call adaptive path integral smoother apis expectation-maximization algorithm obtain point estimate causal connectivity demonstrate synthetic data procedure find correct network structure also direction effective connection random initialization connectivity matrix addition -- motivate contradictory claim literature -- examine effect neuronal timescale sensitivity bold signal change connectivity maximum likelihood solution connectivity conclude two warning first connectivity estimate assumption slow dynamic extremely bias data generate fast neuronal process second fast time scale less sensitive bold signal change incoming connection node hence connectivity estimation use realistic neural dynamic timescale require extremely high-quality data seem infeasible many practical data set
