 receptor array optimize natural odor statistic natural odor typically consist many molecule different concentration unclear numerous odorant molecule possible mixture discriminate relatively olfactory receptor use information-theoretic model show receptor array optimal task achieve two possibly conflict goal receptor respond half odor ii response different receptor uncorrelated average odor present natural statistic use design principle predict statistic affinity receptor odorant molecule broad class odor statistic also show optimal receptor array tune either resolve concentration well distinguish mixture reliably finally use result predict property experimentally measure receptor array work thus use well understand natural olfaction also suggest way improve artificial sensor array
