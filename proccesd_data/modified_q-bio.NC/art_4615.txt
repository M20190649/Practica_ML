 social-sparsity brain decoder faster spatial sparsity spatially-sparse predictor good model brain decoding give accurate prediction weight map interpretable focus small number region however state art base total variation graph-net computationally costly introduce sparsity local neighborhood voxel social-sparsity structured shrinkage operator find brain image classification problem social-sparsity performs almost well total-variation model good graph-net fraction computational cost also clearly outlines predictive region give detail model algorithm
