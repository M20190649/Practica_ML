 robustness functional network criticality structural defect robustness dynamical property neuronal network structural damage central problem computational experimental neuroscience research show cortical network healthy brain work near critical state moreover functional neuronal network often scale-free small-world property work study robustness simple functional network criticality affect structural defect particular consider ising model critical temperature investigate functional network change increase degree structural defect show scale-free small-world property functional network criticality robust large degree structural lesion system remain percolation limit although ising model conceptual description two-state neuron research reveal fundamental robustness property functional network derive classical statistical mechanic model
