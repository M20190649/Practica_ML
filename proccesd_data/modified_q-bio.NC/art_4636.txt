 dopamine modulation prefrontal delay activity-reverberatory activity sharpness tune curve recent electrophysiological experiment show dopamine modulation pyramidal cell prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency adaptation enhances nmda transmission use four model multicompartmental integrate fire examine effect modulation sustained delay activity reverberatory network find modulation may enable robust network bistability yield selective reverberation among cell code particular item location show tune curve cell sharpen signal-to-noise ratio increase postulate modulation affect tuning memory field yield efficient distribute dynamic representation
