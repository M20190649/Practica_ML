 improve hodgkin huxley-type model action potential squid extend crude goldman-hodgkin-katz electrodiffusion model resting-state membrane potential perfused axon squid reformulate hodgkin-huxley hh phenomenological quantitative model create model simple quantitative base fundamentally electrodiffusion principle dynamical system like hh behave -dimensional resonator exhibit subthreshold oscillation speed propagate action potential degree celsius good agreement hh experimental value degree celsius unlike hh counterpart predict spike train prolonged constant-current stimulation agreement recent experiment resonator model predict rebound spike follow prolonged hyperpolarizing stimulation observe degree celsius hh predict temperature quantitative model spike promote brief m hyperpolarization also predict room temperature electrodiffusion model much low temperature ca degree celsius hh model spiking giant axon induce directly brief hyperpolarizing stimulation room temperature appear investigate experimentally either stationary membrane action potential propagating counterpart
