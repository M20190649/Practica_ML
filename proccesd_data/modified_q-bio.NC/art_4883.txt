 information brain represent continuous discrete form question continuous-versus-discrete information representation brain fundamental yet unresolved physiological question historically analysis assume continuous representation without consider alternative possibility discrete representation work explore plausibility representation answer question communication engineering perspective draw well-established shannon 's communication theory posit information brain represent discrete form use computer simulation show information communicate reliably neuron use continuous representation due presence noise neural information discrete form addition design human behavioral experiment probability estimation analyze data use novel discrete quantize model probability discrete model probability two distinct probability say treat indifferently find data participant good fit discrete model continuous one furthermore re-analyzed data publish human behavioral study intertemporal choice use novel discrete quantize model intertemporal choice model two distinct time delay say day day treat indifferently find corroborate result show data participant good fit discrete model continuous one summary result report support discrete hypothesis information representation brain signify major demarcation current understanding brain 's physiology
