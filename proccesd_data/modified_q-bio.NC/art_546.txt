 stochastic synchrony could work cerebellar purkinje cell simple spike synchrony purkinje cell project common neuron deep cerebellar nucleus emerge important factor encoding output information cerebellar cortex stochastic synchronization viable mechanism synchrony could generate receive scarce attention perhaps presence feedforward inhibition input purkinje cell make insight difficult paper present method account feedforward inhibition usual mathematical approach stochastic synchronization apply three concept input correlation heterogeneity prc shape introduce facilitate intuitive understanding different factor affect synchronization purkinje cell follow discussion stochastic synchrony could play role cerebellar response different assumption
