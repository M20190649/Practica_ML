 coactivated clique base multisource overlap brain subnetwork extraction subnetwork extraction use community detection method commonly use study brain 's modular structure recent study indicate certain brain region know interact multiple subnetworks however existing method mainly non-overlapping subnetwork extraction paper present approach overlap brain subnetwork extraction use clique define co-activated node group perform multiple task propose multisource subnetwork extraction approach base co-activated clique use task co-activation task connectivity strength information clique identification automatically detect clique different size neuroscientific justification share subnetwork membership derive fusion rest task data among node within clique overlap subnetwork extraction real data compare commonly used overlap community detection technique show approach improve subnetwork extraction term group-level subject-wise reproducibility also show multisource approach identify subnetwork overlap within brain region match well hub define use functional anatomical information enable u study interaction subnetworks hubs play role information flow across different subnetworks demonstrate assignment interact individual node use approach correspond posterior probability derive independently multimodal random walker base approach
