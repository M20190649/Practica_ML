 random projection random manifold interest data often concentrate low dimensional smooth manifold inside high dimensional ambient space random projection simple powerful tool dimensionality reduction data previous work study bound many projection need accurately preserve geometry manifold give intrinsic dimensionality volume curvature however work employ definition volume curvature inherently difficult compute therefore theory easily test numerical simulation understand tightness proven bound instead study typical distortion arise random projection ensemble smooth gaussian random manifold find explicitly computable approximate theoretical bound number projection require accurately preserve geometry manifold bound approximate violate probability exponentially small ambient dimension therefore hold high probability case practical interest moreover unlike previous work test theoretical bound numerical experiment actual geometric distortion typically occur random projection random smooth manifold find bound tight previous result several order magnitude
