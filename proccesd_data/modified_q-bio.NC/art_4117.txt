 encode binary neural code network threshold-linear neuron network neuron brain encode prefer pattern neural activity via synaptic connection despite receive considerable attention precise relationship network connectivity encode pattern still poorly understood consider problem network threshold-linear neuron whose computational function learn store set binary pattern e.g. neural code permitted set network introduce simple encoding rule selectively turn synapsis neuron co-appear one pattern rule use synapsis binary sense two state also heterogeneous weight draw underlie synaptic strength matrix s. main result precisely describe stored pattern result encoding rule -- include unintended spurious state -- give explicit characterization dependence s. particular find binary pattern successfully store network excitatory connection neuron geometrically balance -- i.e. satisfy set geometric constraint furthermore find certain type neural code natural context network mean full code accurately learn highly undersampled set pattern interestingly many commonly observed neural code cortical hippocampal area natural sense application construct network encode hippocampal place field code nearly exactly follow presentation small fraction pattern obtain result prove new theorem use classical idea convex distance geometry cayley-menger determinant reveal novel connection area mathematics cod property neural network
