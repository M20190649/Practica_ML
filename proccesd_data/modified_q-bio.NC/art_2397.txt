 solve hodgkin-huxley equation use compact difference scheme -tapering dendrite dendritic processing consider important pre-processing signal come cell dendrite involve propagation backpropagation signal cylindrical dendrite signal move either direction similar however dendrite taper case picture get complex ion channel distribution along dendrite also non-uniform equation solve use chebyshev pseudo-spectral method look non-uniform dendritic voltage gate channel cylindrical taper dendrite back-propagating signal signal accentuate case taper dendrite assume hodgkin-huxley formulation ion channel solve equation compact finite-difference scheme scheme give spectral-like spatial resolution easy solve spectral method show scheme able reproduce result obtain spectral method compact difference scheme widely use study turbulence airflow however use first time laboratory solve equation involve transmission signal brain
