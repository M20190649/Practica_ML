 first-spike base visual categorization use reward-modulated stdp reinforcement learn rl recently regain popularity major achievement beat european game go champion first time show rl use efficiently train spike neural network snn perform object recognition natural image without use external classifier use feedforward convolutional snn temporal coding scheme strongly activated neuron fire first less activated one fire later high layer neuron assign object category assume stimulus category category first neuron fire assumption correct neuron reward i.e spike-timing-dependent plasticity stdp apply reinforce neuron 's selectivity otherwise anti-stdp apply encourage neuron learn something else demonstrate various image datasets caltech eth- norb reward modulate stdp r-stdp approach extract particularly discriminative visual feature whereas classic unsupervised stdp extract feature consistently repeat result r-stdp outperform stdp datasets furthermore r-stdp suitable online learning adapt drastic change label permutation finally worth mention feature extraction classification do spike use one spike per neuron thus network hardware friendly energy efficient
