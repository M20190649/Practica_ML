 graph frequency analysis brain signal paper present method analyze functional brain network signal graph spectral perspective notion frequency filter traditionally define signal support regular domain discrete time image grid recently generalize irregular graph domain defines brain graph frequency associate different level spatial smoothness across brain region brain network frequency also enable decomposition brain signal piece correspond smooth rapid variation relate graph frequency principal component analysis network interest denote functional connectivity method utilized analyze brain network signal subject master simple motor skill observe brain signal correspond different graph frequency exhibit different level adaptability throughout learning notice strong association graph spectral property brain network level exposure task perform recognize contributing important frequency signature different task familiarity
