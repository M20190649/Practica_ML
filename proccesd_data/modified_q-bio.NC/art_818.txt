 towards deep learn segregated dendrite deep learning lead significant advance artificial intelligence part adopt strategy motivate neurophysiology however unclear whether deep learning could occur real brain show deep learning algorithm utilize multi-compartment neuron might help u understand brain optimize cost function like neocortical pyramidal neuron neuron model receive sensory information higher-order feedback electrotonically segregated compartment thanks segregation neuron different layer network coordinate synaptic weight update result network learn categorize image good single layer network furthermore show algorithm take advantage multilayer architecture identify useful representation -- -the hallmark deep learning work demonstrate deep learning achieve use segregate dendritic compartment may help explain dendritic morphology neocortical pyramidal neuron
