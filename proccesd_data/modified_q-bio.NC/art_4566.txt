 consciousness computable quantify integrate information use algorithmic information theory article review tononi 's theory consciousness integrated information argue previous formalization integrated information e.g griffith depend information loss since lossy integration would necessitate continuous damage exist memory propose natural frame consciousness lossless integrative process provide formalization idea use algorithmic information theory prove complete lossless integration require noncomputable function result imply unitary consciousness exists model computationally
