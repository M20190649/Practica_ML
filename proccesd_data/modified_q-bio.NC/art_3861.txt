 pairwise maximum entropy model study large biological system ca n't work one critical problem face study biological system build accurate statistical description problem particularly challenging biological system typically contain large number interact element preclude use standard brute force approach recently though several group report may alternate strategy report show reliable statistical model build without knowledge interaction system instead pairwise interaction suffice finding however base analysis small subsystem ask whether observation generalize system realistic size whether pairwise model provide reliable description true biological system result show case reason crossover predictive power pairwise model size subsystem crossover point result predictive power large system size crossover point result predictive power work thus provide general framework determine extent pairwise model use predict behavior whole biological system apply neural data size system study far crossover point
