 cortical criticality unique indication optimize neural computation neural network include brain operate criticality previous approach however use diverse fingerprint criticality leave open question whether refer unique critical point whether could several use recurrent spike neural network model demonstrate avalanche criticality necessarily lie dynamical edge-of-chaos therefore different fingerprint indicate distinct phenomenon yet unclarified relationship
