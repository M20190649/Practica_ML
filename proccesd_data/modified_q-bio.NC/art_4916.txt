 simple reservoir model work memory real value prefrontal cortex know involve many high-level cognitive function particular work memory study extent group randomly connect unit namely echo state network esn store maintain output arbitrary real value streamed input i.e act sustained working memory unit furthermore explore extent architecture take advantage stored value order produce non-linear computation comparison different architecture without feedback without working memory unit show explicit memory improve performance
