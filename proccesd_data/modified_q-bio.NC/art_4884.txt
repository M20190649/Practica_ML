 intracranial error detection via deep learn deep learning technique revolutionize field machine learning recently successfully apply various classification problem noninvasive electroencephalography eeg however method far rarely evaluate use intracranial eeg employ convolutional neural network cnns classify characterize error-related brain response measure intracranial eeg recording decode accuracy cnns significantly high regularized linear discriminant analysis use time-resolved deep decoding possible classify error various region human brain decode error m actual erroneous button press e.g. precentral gyrus moreover deep network perform good shallow network distinguish correct error trial all-channel decoding single recording decode accuracy achieve visualization network learn feature indicate multivariate decoding ensemble channel yield related albeit non-redundant information compare single-channel decoding summary show usefulness deep learning intracranial error decoding mapping spatio-temporal structure human error processing network
