 intrinsic noise induce various resonant peak theoretically describe weak signal may efficiently transmit throughout one frequency range noisy excitable medium kind stochastic multiresonance serve u reinterpret recent experiment neuroscience suggest many system nature might able exhibit several resonance fact observed behavior happen network model result competition change transmitted signal unit vary activation threshold adaptive noise realize model rapid activity-dependent fluctuation connection intensity two condition indeed know characterize heterogeneously networked system excitable unit e.g. set neuron synapsis brain result may find application also design detector device
