 fire rate equation require spike synchrony mechanism correctly describe fast oscillation inhibitory network recurrently couple network inhibitory neuron robustly generate oscillation gamma band nonetheless corresponding wilson-cowan type fire rate equation inhibitory population generate oscillation without explicit time delay show discrepancy due voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent network spike neuron capture standard fire rate equation investigate exact low-dimensional description network heterogeneous canonical type-i inhibitory neuron include sub-threshold dynamic crucial generate synchronous state limit slow synaptic kinetics spike-synchrony mechanism suppress standard wilson-cowan equation formally recover long external input also slow however even limit synchronous spiking elicit input fluctuate time-scale membrane time-constant neuron meanfield equation therefore represent extension standard wilson-cowan equation spike synchrony also correctly describe
