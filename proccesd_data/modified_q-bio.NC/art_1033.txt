 regulation irregular neuronal firing autaptic transmission importance self-feedback autaptic transmission modulate spike-time irregularity still poorly understood use biophysical model incorporate autaptic coupling show self-innervation neuron participates modulation irregular neuronal firing primarily regulate occurrence frequency burst firing particular find excitatory electrical autapses increase occurrence burst firing thus reduce neuronal firing regularity contrast inhibitory autapses suppress burst firing therefore tend improve regularity neuronal firing importantly show finding independent firing property individual neuron observe neuron operate different mode result provide insightful mechanistic understanding different type autapses shape irregular firing single-neuron level highlight functional importance autaptic self-innervation tame modulate neurodynamics
