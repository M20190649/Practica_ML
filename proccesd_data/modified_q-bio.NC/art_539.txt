 learning precise spike time membrane potential dependent synaptic plasticity precise spatio-temporal pattern neuronal action potential underly e.g sensory representation control muscle activity however know synaptic efficacy neuronal network brain adapt reliably generate spike specific point time exist activity-dependent plasticity rule like spike-timing-dependent plasticity agnostic goal learn spike time hand exist formal supervise learn algorithms perform temporally precise comparison project activity target know biologically plausible implementation comparison propose simple local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism derive requirement balanced membrane potential since relevant signal synaptic change postsynaptic voltage rather spike time call plasticity rule membrane potential dependent plasticity mpdp combine plasticity mechanism spike after-hyperpolarization cause sensitivity synaptic change pre- postsynaptic spike time reproduce hebbian spike time dependent plasticity inhibitory synapsis find experiment addition sensitivity mpdp time course voltage generate spike allow mpdp distinguish weak spurious strong teacher spike therefore provide neuronal basis comparison actual target activity spatio-temporal input spike pattern conceptually simple plasticity rule achieve surprisingly high storage capacity spike association sensitivity mpdp subthreshold membrane potential training allow robust memory retrieval learn even presence activity corrupt noise
