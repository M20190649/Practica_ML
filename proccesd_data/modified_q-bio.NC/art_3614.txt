 learn solve credit assignment problem backpropagation drive today 's artificial neural network anns however despite extensive research remain unclear brain implement algorithm among neuroscientist reinforcement learn rl algorithm often see realistic alternative neuron randomly introduce change use unspecific feedback signal observe effect cost thus approximate gradient however convergence rate learning scale poorly number involved neuron e.g n propose hybrid learning approach neuron use rl-type strategy learn approximate gradient backpropagation would provide -- way learn learn provide proof approach converge true gradient certain class network feed-forward recurrent network empirically show approach learn approximate gradient match performance gradient-based learning learn learn provide biologically plausible mechanism achieve good performance without need precise pre-specified learning rule
