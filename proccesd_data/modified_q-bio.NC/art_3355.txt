 spatially localize atlas network tile enable whole brain segmentation limit data whole brain segmentation structural magnetic resonance imaging mri essential non-invasive investigation neuroanatomy historically multi-atlas segmentation ma regard de facto standard method whole brain segmentation recently deep neural network approach apply whole brain segmentation learn random patch slice yet previous effort make detailed whole brain segmentation use network due following challenge fitting entire whole brain volume network restrict current gpu memory large number target label e.g. label limited number train volume e.g. scan paper propose spatially localize atlas network tile slant method distribute multiple independent fully convolutional network cover overlapped sub-spaces standard atlas space strategy simplify whole brain learn task localize sub-tasks enable comb canonical registration label fusion technique deep learning address second challenge auxiliary label initially unlabeled scan create ma pre-training empirical validation state-of-the-art ma method achieve mean dice value propose method achieve three validation cohort moreover computational time reduce hour use ma minute use propose method source code available online http github.com masilab slantbrainseg
