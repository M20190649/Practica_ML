 gradient hyperalignment multi-subject fmri data alignment multi-subject fmri data analysis interesting challenge problem human brain decoding study inherent anatomical functional variability across subject make necessary anatomical functional alignment classification analysis besides come big data time complexity become problem ignore paper propose gradient hyperalignment gradient-ha gradient-based functional alignment method suitable multi-subject fmri datasets large amount sample voxels advantage gradient-ha solve independence high dimension problem use independent component analysis ica stochastic gradient ascent sga validation use multi-classification task big data demonstrate gradient-ha method less time complexity good comparable performance compare state-of-the-art functional alignment method
