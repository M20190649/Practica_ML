 bend slab neural tissue comparative developmental neuroanatomy one encounter question regard deformation neural tissue stress motivation note observation barbas et al cortical fold gyrus layer neural tissue show relative thickening thinning upper deep layer general material property slab neural tissue know even know would probably lead difficult problem elasticity theory simple argument present show bend elastic slab produce relative thickening layer inside bend argument base incompressibility material therefore fairly robust
