 early salient region selection drive rapid visual categorization current dominant visual processing paradigm human machine research feedforward layer hierarchy neural-like processing element within paradigm visual saliency see many specific role namely early selection early selection think enable fast visual performance limit processing relevant candidate portion image though strategy indeed lead improve processing time efficiency machine algorithm least one set critical test idea never perform respect role early selection human vision would best current saliency model perform stimulus use experimentalists first provide evidence visual processing paradigm would algorithm really provide correct candidate sub-images enable fast categorization image report new series test question whose result suggest quite unlikely early selection process role human rapid visual categorization
