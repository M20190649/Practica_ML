 sparse bayesian learning eeg source localization purpose localize source electrical activity electroencephalographic eeg data gain considerable attention last year paper propose innovative source localization method eeg base sparse bayesian learning sbl method well specify sparsity profile ensure efficient source localization propose approach considers group electrical current dipole inside human brain sbl use solve localization problem addition imposed constraint electric current dipole associate brain activity isotropic result numerical experiment conduct realistic head model obtain segmentation mri image head include four major component namely scalp skull cerebrospinal fluid csf brain appropriate relative conductivity value result demonstrate isotropy constraint significantly improve performance sbl noiseless environment propose method find accurately accuracy locate simultaneously active source whereas sbl without isotropy constraint accuracy find simultaneously active source conclusion compare state-of-the-art algorithm propose method potentially consistent specify sparsity profile human brain activity able produce good source localization eeg
