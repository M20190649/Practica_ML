 choice metric gradient-based theory brain function idea brain function minimize certain cost pervade theoretical neuroscience since cost function predict brain find minimum additional assumption optimization method need make predict dynamic physiological quantity context steep descent also call gradient descent often suggest algorithmic principle optimization potentially implement brain practice researcher often consider vector partial derivative gradient however definition gradient notion steep direction depend choice metric since choice metric involve large number degree freedom predictive power model base gradient descent must call question unless strong constraint choice metric provide didactic review mathematics gradient descent illustrate common pitfall use gradient descent principle brain function example literature propose way forward constrain metric
