 cortical thickness functional network module cortical lobe study aim investigate topological organization cortical thickness functional network cortical lobe first demonstrate modular organization network cortical surface frontal temporal parietal occipital division secondly map overlap edge cortical thickness functional network positive negative correlation finally show overlap positive edge map onto within-lobe cortical interaction negative onto between-lobes interaction
