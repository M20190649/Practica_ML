 reverse engineering neural network many partial recording much neuroscience aim reverse engineering brain record small number neuron time currently know reverse engineering brain require u simultaneously record neuron multiple recording small subset suffice make even important development novel technique allow record select subset neuron e.g use optical technique get question analyze neural network train mnist dataset use partial recording characterize dependency quality reverse engineering number simultaneously record neuron find reverse engineering nonlinear neural network meaningfully possible sufficiently large number neuron simultaneously record number considerably small number neuron moreover record many time small random subset neuron yield surprisingly good performance application neuroscience suggests approximate function actual neural system need record much large number neuron kind scale analysis perform arguably use calibrate approach dramatically scale size record data set neuroscience
