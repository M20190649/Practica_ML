 identification temporal transition functional state use recurrent neural network functional mri dynamic functional connectivity analysis provide valuable information understand brain functional activity underlie different cognitive process besides slide window base approach variety method develop automatically split entire functional mri scan segment detect change point functional signal facilitate good characterization temporally dynamic functional connectivity pattern however method base certain assumption functional signal gaussian distribution necessarily suitable fmri data study develop deep learning base framework adaptively detect temporally dynamic functional state transition data-driven way without explicit modeling assumption leverage recent advance recurrent neural network rnns sequence modeling particularly solve problem anomaly detection framework assumption functional profile one single time point could reliably predict base preceding profile within stable functional state large prediction error would occur around change point functional state evaluate propose method use task resting-state fmri data obtain human connectome project experimental result demonstrate propose change point detection method could effectively identify change point different task event split resting-state fmri segment distinct functional connectivity pattern
