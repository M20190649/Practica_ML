 minimal perceptrons memorize complex pattern feedforward neural network investigate understand learning memory well apply numerous practical problem pattern classification rule thumb complex task require large network however design optimal network architecture specific task still unsolved fundamental problem study consider three-layered neural network memorize binary pattern develop new complexity measure binary pattern estimate minimal network size memorize function complexity formulate minimal network size regular random complex pattern particular minimal size complex pattern neither ordered disordered predict measure hamming distance know ordered pattern prediction agree simulation base back-propagation algorithm
