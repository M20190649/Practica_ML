 predict spatiotemporal diversity seizure propagation termination human focal epilepsy recent study show seizure spread terminate across brain area via rich diversity spatiotemporal pattern particular location seizure onset area usually in-variant across seizure patient source travel hz spike-and-wave discharge swds seizure either move slow propagating ictal wavefront remain stationary seizure onset area addition although focal seizure terminate quasi-synchronously across brain area evolve distinct ictal cluster terminate asynchronously provide unifying perspective observed diversity spatiotemporal dynamic seizure spread termination introduce epileptor neural field model two mechanism play essential role first slow ictal wavefront propagate front excitable neural medium faster swds propagation result coupled-oscillator dynamic second multiple time scale interact seizure spread allow low-voltage fast-activity hz hamper seizure spread swd propagation affect way seizure terminate dynamic together variation short long-range connectivity strength play central role seizure spread maintenance termination demonstrate epileptor field model incorporate mechanism predict previously report diversity seizure spread pattern furthermore confirm prediction synchronous asynchronous clustered seizure termination human seizure record via stereotactic eeg new insight seizure spatiotemporal dynamic may also contribute development new closed-loop neuromodulation therapy focal epilepsy
