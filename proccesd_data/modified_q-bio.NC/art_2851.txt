 decoding neural data use cohomological feature extraction introduce novel data-driven approach discover decode feature neural code come large population neural recording minimal assumption use cohomological feature extraction apply approach neural recording mouse move freely box find circular feature observe decoded value correspond well head direction mouse thus capture head direction cell decode head direction neural population activity without process behaviour mouse interestingly decoded value convey information neural activity tracked head direction difference spatial organization finally note residual population activity head direction account retain low-dimensional structure correlate speed mouse
