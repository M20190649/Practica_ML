 deep neural network reveal gradient complexity neural representation across brain 's ventral visual pathway converge evidence suggest mammalian ventral visual pathway encodes increasingly complex stimulus feature downstream area use deep convolutional neural network quantitatively demonstrate indeed explicit gradient feature complexity ventral pathway human brain approach also allow stimulus feature increase complexity map across human brain provide automated approach probe representation map across cortical sheet finally show deep convolutional neural network allow decoding representation human brain previously unattainable degree accuracy provide sensitive window human brain
