 integrate flexible normalization mid-level representation deep convolutional neural network deep convolutional neural network cnns become increasingly popular model predict neural response visual cortex however contextual effect prevalent neural processing perception explicitly handle current cnns include use neural prediction primary visual cortex neural response modulate stimulus spatially surround classical receptive field rich way effect model divisive normalization approach include flexible model spatial normalization recruit degree response center surround location deem statistically dependent propose flexible normalization model apply mid-level representation deep cnns tractable way study contextual normalization mechanism mid-level cortical area approach capture non-trivial spatial dependency among mid-level feature cnns present texture visual stimulus arise tile high order feature geometrically expect propose approach make prediction spatial normalization might recruit mid-level cortical area also expect approach useful part cnn toolkit therefore go beyond restrictive fixed form normalization
