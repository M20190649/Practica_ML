 use branch predictor monitor brain activity key problem neuroprostheses brain monitoring interface need extreme energy efficiency one way lower energy use low power mode avail- able processor embed device present technique predict neuronal activity interest likely occur processor run nominal operating frequency time place low power mode otherwise achieve discover branch predictor also predict brain activity perform brain surgery awake anesthetized mouse evaluate several branch predictor find perceptron branch predictor predict cerebellar activity accuracy high consequently co-opt branch predictor dictate transition low power normal operating mode save much processor energy
