 generalize cable formalism calculate magnetic field single neuron neuronal population neuron generate magnetic field record macroscopic technique magneto-encephalography theory account genesis neuronal magnetic field involve dendritic cable structure homogeneous resistive extracellular medium generalize model consider dendritic cable extracellular medium arbitrarily complex electric property method base multi-scale mean-field theory neuron consider interaction mean extracellular medium characterize specific impedance first show expect generalize cable equation standard cable generate magnetic field mostly depend axial current cable moderate contribution extracellular current less expect also show nature extracellular intracellular medium influence axial current thus also influence neuronal magnetic field illustrate property numerical simulation suggest experiment test finding
