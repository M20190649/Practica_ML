 synchronization oscillator time-shifted common input share upstream dynamical process frequently source common input various physical biological system however due finite signal transmission speed difference distance source time shift otherwise common input unavoidable since common input source correlation element multi-unit dynamical system regardless whether element directly connect one another importance understand impact synchronization canonical model representative variety different dynamical system study limit-cycle oscillator drive stochastic time-shifted common input show oscillator couple time shift stochastic common input simply shift distribution phase difference rather distribution actually change result best synchronization therefore achieve precise intermediate value time shift due resonance-like effect probable phase difference determine deterministic dynamic
