 dynamic balance excitation inhibition human monkey neocortex balance excitation inhibition fundamental feature vivo network activity important computation however presence neocortex high mammal well establish investigate dynamic excitation inhibition use dense multielectrode recording human monkey find state wake-sleep cycle excitatory inhibitory ensemble well balance co-fluctuate slight instantaneous deviation perfect balance mostly slow-wave sleep remarkably correlate fluctuation see many different temporal scale similarity computational feature network model self-generated balanced state suggest balanced activity essentially generate recurrent activity local network due external input finally find balance break seizure temporal correlation excitatory inhibitory population disrupt result show balanced activity feature normal brain activity break balance could important factor define pathological state
