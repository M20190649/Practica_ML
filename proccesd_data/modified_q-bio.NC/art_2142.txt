 short-term memory effect auditory biofeedback isometric force control differential effect function transition trial aim present study investigate memory effect force accuracy variability constant isometric force different force level use auditory biofeedback two type transition trial use biofeedback-no biofeedback transition trial biofeedback-biofeedback transition trial auditory biofeedback produce low- high-pitched sound participant produce isometric force lower high require respectively achieve goal participant ask produce maintain two different isometric force pm n pm s. constant error standard deviation isometric force calculate accuracy variability isometric force vary accord transition trial drift force appear biofeedback condition result suggest degradation information force output biofeedback condition provide leaky memory buffer mainly dependent sense effort drift remain constant whatever transition use memory buffer seem independent short-term memory process
