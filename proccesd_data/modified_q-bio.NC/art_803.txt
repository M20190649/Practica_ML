 differential activation pattern brain region lead opposite emotional state human study averaged activation brain region relate human behavior extensively investigate approach lead finding positive negative facial preference represent different brain region however use multi-voxel pattern induction method find different pattern neural activation within cingulate cortex cc play role represent opposite emotional state present study neutrally-preferred face present activation pattern cc correspond higher low preference repeatedly induce pattern induction method result previously neutrally-preferred face become less preferred conclude different activation pattern cc rather average activation different area represent causally determines positive negative facial preference new approach may reveal importance activation pattern within brain region many cognitive function
