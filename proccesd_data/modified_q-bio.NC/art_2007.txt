 maximum memory capacity neural network short-term depression facilitation work study analytically employ monte carlo simulation influence competition several activity-dependent synaptic process short-term synaptic facilitation depression maximum memory storage capacity neural network contrast case synaptic depression drastically reduce capacity network store retrieve static activity pattern synaptic facilitation enhance storage capacity different context particular find optimal value relevant synaptic parameter neurotransmitter release probability characteristic facilitation time constant storage capacity maximal similar one obtain static synapsis without activity-dependent process conclude depress synapsis certain level facilitation allow recover good retrieval property network static synapsis maintain nonlinear characteristic dynamic synapsis convenient information processing coding
