 grid cell show field-to-field variability explain aperiodic response inhibitory interneurons research network mechanism cod property grid cell assume fire rate grid cell field furthermore propose network model predict spatial regularity firing inhibitory interneurons inconsistent experimental data paper analyze response grid cell record rat free navigation first show strong variation mean firing rate field individual grid cell thus show data inconsistent theoretical model predict similar peak magnitude build two population excitatory-inhibitory network model sparse spatially selective input excitatory cell presume arise e.g salient external stimulus hippocampus combination lead variability firing field amplitude grid cell show combine appropriate connectivity excitatory inhibitory neuron variability firing field amplitude grid cell result inhibitory neuron exhibit regular spatial firing consistent experimental data finally show even spatial position field maintain variation firing rate field grid cell enough cause remapping hippocampal cell
