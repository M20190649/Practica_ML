 bifurcation spike neural network recently spike neural network snns receive much attention rich biological significance power process spatial temporal information however exist snns static due fixed eigenvalue spike generation function mean neuron fire spike fixed frequency receive constant input signal thereby static snns limit scalability paper clarify bifurcation relationship dynamic eigenvalue great influence neuron excitation frequency propose bifurcation spike neural network bsnn develop dynamic snn different traditional static snns bsnn take bifurcation system time-varying eigenvalue basic building block thus powerful flexibility able handle data complex nonlinear structure experiment wide-range task conduct include delayed-memory xor task four image recognition datasets ucr archive result show performance bsnn superior exist static snn model
