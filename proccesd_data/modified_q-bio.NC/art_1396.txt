 homeostatic plasticity emergence functional network whole-brain model criticality understand relationship large-scale structural functional brain network remain crucial issue modern neuroscience recently grow interest investigate role homeostatic plasticity mechanism across different spatiotemporal scale regulate network activity brain functioning wide range environmental condition brain state e.g. learning development age neurological disease present study investigate inclusion homeostatic plasticity stochastic whole-brain model implement normalization incoming node 's excitatory input affect macroscopic activity rest formation functional network importantly address structure-function relationship group individual-based level work show normalization node 's excitatory input improve correspondence simulated neural pattern model various brain functional data indeed find best match achieve model control parameter critical value normalization minimize variability critical point neuronal activity pattern among subject therefore result suggest inclusion homeostatic principle lead realistic brain activity consistent hallmark criticality theoretical framework open new perspective personalized brain modeling potential application investigate deviation criticality due structural lesion e.g stroke brain disorder
