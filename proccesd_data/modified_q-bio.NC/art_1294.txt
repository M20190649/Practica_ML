 build dynamical network model neural spike data application poisson likelihood research show information transmit biological neuron encode instant successive action potential firing rate addition in-vivo operation neuron make measurement difficult thus continuous data collection restrict due reason classical mean square estimation technique frequently use neural network training difficult apply situation point process related likelihood method may beneficial study present one apply certain method use stimulus-response data obtain neural process mathematical modeling neuron study theoretical nature support simulation addition compare similar study perform network model
