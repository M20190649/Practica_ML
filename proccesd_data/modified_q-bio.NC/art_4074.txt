 echo correlated neural system correlation employ modern physic explain microscopic macroscopic phenomenon like fractional quantum hall effect mott insulator state high temperature superconductors ultracold atom simultaneously probed neuron intact brain reveal correlation activity important measure study information processing brain also influence macroscopic signal neural activity like electro encephalogram eeg network spike neuron differ physical system interaction element direct time delay mediate short pulse neuron receive event thousand neuron even stationary state network describe equilibrium statistical mechanic develop quantitative theory pairwise correlation finite sized random network spike neuron derive explicit analytic expression population average cross correlation function theory explain intuitive mean field description fails echo single action potential cause apparent lag inhibition respect excitation size network scale maintain dynamical state finally derive new criterion emergence collective oscillation spectrum time-evolution propagator
