 metabolic cost organize principle cooperative learning paper investigate neuron use metabolic cost facilitate learning population level although decision-making individual neuron extensively study question regard neuron behave cooperate effectively remain largely unaddressed assumption capture basic feature cortical neuron show constrain reward maximization metabolic cost aligns information content action expect reward thus metabolic cost provide mechanism whereby neuron encode expect reward output aside reduce energy expenditure impose tight metabolic constraint also increase accuracy empirical estimate reward increase robustness distributed learning finally present two implementation metabolically constrain learning confirm theoretical finding result suggest metabolic cost may organize principle underlie neural code may also provide useful guide design analysis cooperate population
