 spike statistic stochastic homoclinic neuron model bistable region neuron typically show two distinct dynamical regime rest state correspond stable fixpoint often observe low average input high input commonly result tonic spiking correspond stable limit cycle neuron however show additional intermediate bistable regime coexistence resting-state fixpoint limit-cycle spiking article bistable neuron spike onset saddle-homoclinic orbit bifurcation investigate bistable region noise switch rest spiking thus increase variability spike train compare neuron one stable attractor consequence spike-time coding effectively increase output entropy neuronal ensemble spike statistic derive homoclinic conductance-based neuron model switch rest spiking mainly determine along downstroke action potential dynamical feature lacking common neuron model reset dynamic nonetheless similar derivation apply quadratic integrate-and-fire model derive interspike interval distribution show unimodal warrant future use meanfield approach network bistable neuron
