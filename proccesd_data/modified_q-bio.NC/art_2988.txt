 tractable method describe complex coupling neuron population rate neuron within population strongly correlate simply capture correlation still matter debate recent study show activity cell influence population rate define summed activity neuron population however explicit tractable model interaction still lack build probabilistic model population activity reproduce fire rate cell distribution population rate linear coupling model tractable mean parameter learn second standard computer even large population recording infer model population neuron salamander retina population single-cell firing rate depend unexpected way population rate particular cell preferred population rate likely fire complex dependency could explain linear coupling cell population rate design general still tractable model could fully account non-linear dependency thus provide simple computationally tractable way learn model reproduce dependence neuron population rate
