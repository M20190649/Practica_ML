 neuronal synchrony complex-valued deep network deep learning recently lead great success task image recognition e.g krizhevsky et al. however deep network still outmatch power versatility brain perhaps part due rich neuronal computation available cortical circuit challenge identify neuronal mechanism relevant find suitable abstraction model show aspect spike timing long hypothesize play crucial role cortical information processing could incorporate deep network build rich versatile representation introduce neural network formulation base complex-valued neuronal unit biologically meaningful also amenable variety deep learning framework unit attribute firing rate phase latter indicating property spike timing show formulation qualitatively capture several aspect think relate neuronal synchrony include gating information processing dynamic binding distributed object representation focus latter demonstrate potential approach several simple experiment thus neuronal synchrony could flexible mechanism fulfill multiple functional role deep network
