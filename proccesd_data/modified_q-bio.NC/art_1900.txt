 capacitance fluctuation cause channel noise reduction stochastic hodgkin-huxley system voltage-dependent ion channel determine electric property axonal cell membrane allow passage ion cell membrane also contribute additional charging cell membrane result so-called capacitance loading switching channel gate open closed configuration intrinsically relate movement gate charge within cell membrane beginning action potential transient gate current opposite direction current sodium ion membrane therefore excitability expect become reduced due influence gating current stochastic hodgkin-huxley like model take account channel noise -- i.e fluctuation number open ion channel -- capacitance fluctuation result dynamic gate charge investigate spike dynamic membrane patch variable size analyze statistic spontaneous spiking main result find gating current yield drastic reduction spontaneous spiking rate sufficiently large ion channel cluster consequently demonstrate prominent mechanism channel noise reduction
