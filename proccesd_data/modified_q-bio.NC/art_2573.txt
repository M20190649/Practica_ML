 two-population model mtl neuron vast majority almost silent recording human medial temporal lobe find many neuron respond picture related stimulus one particular person present propose concept cell respond single concept however direct experimental test concept cell idea appear impossible would need measurement response cell enormous number stimulus propose new statistical method analysis data give powerful way analyze close data concept-cell idea exploit large number sampled neuron give sensitivity situation average response sparsity much less one response number presented stimulus show conventional model single sparsity postulate neuron give extremely poor fit data contrast model two dramatically different population give excellent fit data hippocampus entorhinal cortex hippocampus one population cell sparsity much large fraction respond stimulus result extreme bias reported responsive neuron compare typical neuron finally show allow fact report identified unit correspond multiple neuron find conclusion neural level quantitatively change strengthen even strong difference two population
