 guide synchrony random network sparse random network contain structure consider diluted feed-forward network modeling cortical circuit show feed-forward structure strongly pronounce compare embed random network enable reliable signal transmission propagate localize sub-network synchrony assume prominence however experimentally observe local cortical circuit show nonlinear dendritic interaction discover recent single neuron experiment naturally enable guide synchrony propagation already random recurrent neural network exhibit mildly enhance biologically plausible sub-structures
