 topological brain network distance exist brain network distance often base matrix norm element-wise difference exist matrix norm may fail capture underlying topological difference matrix norm sensitive outlier major disadvantage element-wise distance calculation could severely affect even small number extreme edge weight thus necessary develop network distance recognize topology paper provide survey bottleneck gromov-hausdorff gh kolmogorov-smirnov k distance adapt brain network compare matrix-norm base network distance bottleneck gh-distances often use persistent homology however rarely utilize measure similarity brain network ks-distance recently introduce measure similarity network across different filtration value performance analysis conduct use random network simulation ground truth use twin imaging study provide biological ground truth demonstrate k distance ability determine heritability
