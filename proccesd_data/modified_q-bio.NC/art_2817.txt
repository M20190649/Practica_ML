 blind nonnegative source separation use biological neural network blind source separation i.e extraction independent source mixture important problem artificial natural signal processing address special case problem source mixing matrix know nonnegative example due physical nature source search solution problem implement use biologically plausible neural network specifically consider online set dataset stream neural network novelty approach formulate blind nonnegative source separation similarity matching problem derive neural network similarity match objective importantly synaptic weight network update accord biologically plausible local learning rule
