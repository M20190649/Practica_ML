 retinal oscillation carry visual information cortex thalamic relay cell fire action potential transmit information retina cortex amount information spike train encode usually estimate precision spike timing respect stimulus sensory input however one factor influence neural activity example intrinsic dynamic oscillation network neuron also modulate fire pattern ask retinal oscillation might help convey information neuron downstream specifically make whole-cell recording relay cell reveal retinal input epsps thalamic output spike analyzed event information theory result show thalamic spike train operate two multiplexed channel one channel occupy low frequency band hz encode average firing rate respect stimulus carry information local change image time operate gamma frequency band hz encode spike time relative retinal oscillation oscillation involve extensive area retina likely second channel transmit information global feature visual scene time second channel convey even information first
