 pitch perception complex sound nonlinearity revisit ability auditory system perceive fundamental frequency sound even frequency remove stimulus interesting phenomenon relate pitch complex sound capability know residue '' virtual pitch '' perception first report last century pioneering work seebeck residue perception allow one listen music small transistor radio general poor sometimes negligible response low frequency first attempt due helmholtz explain residue nonlinear effect ear consider originate difference combination tone however later experiment show residue coincide difference combination tone result fact dichotically present signal also elicit residue perception lead nonlinear theory gradually abandon favour central processor model paper use recent result theory nonlinear dynamical system show physical frequency produce generic nonlinear oscillator act upon two independent periodic excitation reproduce great precision experimental data residue without resort kind central processing mechanism
