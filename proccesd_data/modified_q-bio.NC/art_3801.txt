 growth-driven percolation dynamic community formation neuronal system quintessential property neuronal system intensive pattern selective synaptic connection current work describe physics-based approach neuronal shape modeling synthesis consideration simulation neuronal development formation neuronal community start image real neuron geometrical measurement obtain use construct probabilistic model subsequently sample order produce morphologically realistic neuronal cell cell progressively grow monitor connection along time analyse term percolation concept however unlike traditional percolation critical point verify along growth stage density cell remain constant throughout neuronal growth dynamic show simulation grow beta cell tend reach percolation sooner alpha counterpart diameter also percolation become abrupt high density cell markedly sharp beta cell
