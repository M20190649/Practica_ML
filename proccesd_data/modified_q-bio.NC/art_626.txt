 note choice detect probability presence choice bias recently present analytical relationship choice probability noise correlation read-out weight classical feedforward decision-making framework haefner et al derivation assume behavioral report distribute evenly two possible choice assumption often violate empirical data especially compute so-called grand cps combine data across stimulus condition extend analytical result situation subject show clear bias towards one choice e.g non-zero signal condition importantly also extend result discrimination task detection task detect probability much empirical data available find cps dps depend monotonously fraction p choice assign likely option cps dp small p equal increase p increase i.e data deviate ideal zero-signal unbiased scenario deviation small result suggest empirical test feedforward framework b way correct choice probability detect probability measurement combine different stimulus condition increase signal noise
