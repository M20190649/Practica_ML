 generic decoding see imagined object use hierarchical visual feature object recognition key function human machine vision recent study achieve fmri decoding see imagined content prediction limit train example present decoding approach arbitrary object use machine vision principle object category represent set feature render invariant hierarchical processing show visual feature include convolutional neural network predict fmri pattern great accuracy achieve low high-level feature low higher-level visual area respectively predict feature use identify see imagined object category extend beyond decoder training set computed feature numerous object image furthermore decoding imagined object reveals progressive recruitment high lower visual representation result demonstrate homology human machine vision utility brain-based information retrieval
