 active dendrite enhance neuronal dynamic range since first experimental evidence active conductance dendrite neuron show exhibit dendritic excitability expression variety voltage-gated ion channel however despite experimental theoretical effort undertake last decade role excitability kind dendritic computation remain elusive show owe general property excitable medium average output model active dendritic tree highly non-linear function afferent rate attain extremely large dynamic range db moreover model yield double-sigmoid response function experimentally observe retinal ganglion cell claim enhancement dynamic range primary functional role active dendritic conductance predict neuron large dendritic tree large dynamic range block active conductance lead decrease dynamic range
