 inference topology nature synapsis flow information neuronal network characterisation neuronal connectivity one important matter neuroscience work show recently propose informational quantity causal mutual information employ appropriate methodology use correctly infer direction underlying physical synapsis also identify excitatory inhibitory nature consider easy handle measure bivariate time-series success approach relies surprising property find neuronal network non-adjacent neuron understand positive mutual information however exchange information capable cause effect zero transfer entropy remarkably inhibitory connection responsible enhance synchronisation transfer information excitatory connection know enhance entropy network also demonstrate methodology use correctly infer directionality synapsis even presence dynamic observational gaussian noise also successful provide effective directionality inter modular connectivity mean field measure
