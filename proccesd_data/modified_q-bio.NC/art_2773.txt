 analytical modelling temperature effect synapsis previously report temperature may significantly influence neural dynamic different level brain modelling due fact create model computational neuroscience would like make scalable wide-range various brain temperature however currently lack experimental data absence analytical model describe temperature influence synapsis possible include temperature effect multi-neuron modelling level paper propose first step deal problem new analytical model ampa-type synaptic conductance able include temperature effect low-frequency stimulation construct basis markov model description ampa receptor kinetics simplification motivate experimentally monte carlo simulation synaptic transmission model may use efficient accurate implementation temperature effect ampa receptor conductance large scale neural network simulation fact open wide-range new possibility research influence temperature brain functioning
