 filter high frequency noise eeg data use method maximum entropy propose maximum entropy base approach smooth noise data also noise amplify second order derivative calculation data especially electroencephalography eeg study approach include two step apply method generate family filter minimize noise variance apply filter data selects preferred one within family examine performance filter frequency noise variance analysis compare well know filter develop eeg study result show filter outperform others although demonstrate filter design especially second order derivative eeg data study still shed informatic approach systematically design filter specific purpose
