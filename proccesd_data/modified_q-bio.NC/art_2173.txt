 assessment synchrony multiple neural spike train use loglinear point process model neural spike train sequence brief jump voltage across cell membrane one motivating application development point process methodology early work require assumption stationarity contemporary experiment often use time-varying stimulus produce time-varying neural response recently many statistical method develop nonstationary neural point process data also much interest identify synchrony mean event across two neuron nearly simultaneous time scale recording natural statistical approach discretize time use short time bin introduce loglinear model dependency among neuron previous use loglinear model technology assume stationarity introduce succinct yet powerful class time-varying loglinear model allow individual-neuron effect main effect involve time-varying intensity b also allow individual-neuron effect involve autocovariation effect history effect due past spiking c assume excess synchrony effect interaction effect depend history assume effect vary smoothly across time
