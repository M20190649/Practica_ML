 self-organized neural comparator learn algorithm need generally possibility compare several stream information neural learning architecture hence need unit comparator able compare several input encode either internal external information like instance prediction sensory reading without possibility compare value prediction actual sensory input reward evaluation supervise learn would possible comparators usually implement explicitly necessary comparison commonly perform directly compare one-to-one respective activity imply characteristic two input stream like size encoding must provide time design system however plausible biological comparators emerge self-organizing genetically encode principle allow system adapt change input organism propose unsupervised neural circuitry function input comparison emerge via self-organization interaction system respective input without external influence supervision propose neural comparator adapts unsupervised accord correlation present input stream system consist multilayer feed-forward neural network follow local output minimization anti-hebbian rule adaptation synaptic weight local output minimization allow circuit autonomously acquire capability compare neural activity receive different neural population may differ size population neural encoding use comparator able compare object never encounter sensory input stream evaluate measure similarity even differently encode
