 constraint-free natural image reconstruction fmri signal base convolutional neural network recent year research decode brain activity base functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri make remarkable achievement however constraint-free natural image reconstruction brain activity still challenge exist method simplify problem use semantic prior information reconstruct simple image letter digitals without semantic prior information present novel method reconstruct nature image fmri signal human visual cortex base computation model convolutional neural network cnn firstly extract unit output viewed natural image layer pre-trained cnn cnn feature secondly transform image reconstruction fmri signal problem cnn feature visualization train sparse linear regression map fmri pattern cnn feature iteratively optimization find matched image whose cnn unit feature become similar predict brain activity finally achieve promising result challenge constraint-free natural image reconstruction use semantic prior information stimulus train decode model category image constraint training set could reconstruct theoretically find reconstructed image resemble natural stimulus especially position shape experimental result suggest hierarchical visual feature effectively express visual perception process human brain
