 correlation increase fire rate central question neuroscience understand noisy firing pattern use transmit information neural spiking noisy spike pattern often quantified via pairwise correlation probability two cell spike coincidentally beyond baseline firing rate one observation frequently make experiment correlation increase systematically fire rate theoretical study determine stimulus-dependent correlation increase fire rate beneficial effect information coding however still incomplete understanding circuit mechanism produce correlation-firing rate relationship study relationship pairwise correlation fire rate recurrently couple excitatory-inhibitory spike network conductance-based synapsis find strong excitatory coupling positive relationship emerge pairwise correlation fire rate explain finding use linear response theory predict full correlation matrix decompose correlation term graph motif use decomposition explain covariation correlation firing rate -- relationship previously explain feedforward network drive correlated input -- emerge recurrent network others furthermore correlation covary fire rate relationship reflect low-rank structure correlation matrix
