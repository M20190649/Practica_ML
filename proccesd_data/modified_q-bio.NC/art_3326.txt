 study effect deep brain stimulation medication dynamic stn-lfp signal human behavior analysis paper present result recent work study effect deep brain stimulation db medication dynamic brain local field potential lfp signal use behavior analysis patient parkinson disease pd db technique use alleviate severe symptom pd pharmacotherapy effective behavior recognition lfp signal record subthalamic nucleus stn application develop closed-loop db system stimulation pulse adaptively generate accord subject perform behavior exist study behavior recognition use stn-lfps base db paper discover performance accuracy automated behavior recognition lfp signal affect different paradigm stimulation first study notion beta power suppression lfp signal different scenario stimulation medication afterward explore accuracy support vector machine predict human action button press reach use spectrogram stn-lfp signal experiment record lfp signal three subject confirm beta power suppress significantly patient take medication p-value stimulation p-value result also show classify different behavior reasonable accuracy even high-amplitude stimulation apply
