 dynamic network centrality summarize learn human brain study functional activity human brain use functional magnetic resonance imaging recently develop tool network science data arise performance simple behavioural motor learn task unsupervised clustering subject respect similarity network activity measure three day practice produce significant evidence learn sense subject typically move cluster subject whose dynamic similar time progress however high dimensionality time-dependent nature data make difficult explain brain region drive distinction use network centrality measure respect arrow time express data extremely compact form characterize aggregate activity brain region experiment use single coefficient reproduce information learn discover use full data set compact summary allows key brain region contribute centrality visualize interpret thereby provide proof principle use recently propose dynamic centrality measure temporal network data neuroscience
