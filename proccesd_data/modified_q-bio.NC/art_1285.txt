 siminet novel method quantify brain network similarity quantify similarity two network critical many application number algorithm propose compute graph similarity mainly base property node edge interestingly algorithm ignore physical location node key factor context brain network involve spatially define functional area paper present novel algorithm call siminet measure similarity two graph whose node define priori within coordinate system siminet provide quantified index range account node edge spatiality feature complex graph simulate evaluate performance siminet compare eight state-of-art method result show siminet able detect weak spatial variation compare graph addition compute similarity use node edge siminet also apply real brain network obtain visual recognition task algorithm show high performance detect spatial variation brain network obtain naming task two category visual stimulus animal tool perspective work good understanding object categorization human brain
