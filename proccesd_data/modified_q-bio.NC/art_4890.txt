 deep learning approach attention mechanism automatic sleep stage classification automatic sleep staging challenging problem state-of-the-art algorithm yet reach satisfactory performance use instead manual scoring sleep technician much research do find good feature representation extract useful information correctly classify epoch correct sleep stage many useful feature discover amount feature grow extent feature reduction step necessary order avoid curse dimensionality one reason need large feature set many feature good discriminate one sleep stage less informative stage paper explore second feature representation large set pre-defined feature learn use auto-encoder selective attention current sleep stage training batch selective attention allow model learn feature representation focus relevant input without perform dimensionality reduction input data performance propose algorithm evaluate large data set polysomnography psg night recording patient sleep-disordered breathing performance auto-encoder selective attention compare regular auto-encoder previous work use deep belief network dbn
