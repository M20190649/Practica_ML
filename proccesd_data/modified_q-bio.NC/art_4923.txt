 homeostatic plasticity external input shape neural network dynamic vitro vivo spiking activity clearly differ whereas network vitro develop strong burst separate period little spiking activity vivo cortical network show continuous activity puzzle consider network presumably share similar single-neuron dynamic plasticity rule propose define difference vitro vivo dynamic strength external input vitro network virtually isolated whereas vivo every brain area receive continuous input analyze model spike neuron input strength mediate spike rate homeostasis determine characteristic dynamical state detail analytical numerical result various network topology show consistently increase input homeostatic plasticity generate distinct dynamic state burst close-to-critical reverberate irregular state imply dynamic state neural network fix readily adapt input strength indeed result match experimental spike recording vitro vivo vitro bursting behavior consistent state generate low network input whereas vivo activity suggest order recorded spike input-driven result reverberate dynamic importantly predict one abolish ubiquitous burst vitro preparation instead impose dynamic comparable vivo activity expose system weak long-term stimulation thereby open new path establish vivo-like assay vitro basic well neurological study
