 effective efficient roi-wise visual encode use end-to-end cnn regression model selective optimization recently visual encode base functional magnetic resonance image fmri realize many achievement rapid development deep network computation visual encode model aim predict brain activity response present image stimulus currently visual encoding accomplish mainly firstly extract image feature convolutional neural network cnn model pre-trained computer vision task secondly train linear regression model map specific layer cnn feature voxel namely voxel-wise encoding however two-step manner model essentially hard determine kind well feature well linearly match beforehand unknown fmri data little understanding human visual representation analogize computer vision mostly related human vision propose end-to-end convolution regression model etecrm region interest roi -wise manner accomplish effective efficient visual encoding end-to-end manner introduce make model automatically learn good match feature improve encode performance roi-wise manner use improve encoding efficiency many voxels addition design selective optimization include self-adapting weight learning weighted correlation loss noise regularization avoid interfering ineffective voxels roi-wise encoding experiment demonstrate propose model obtain well predict accuracy two-step manner encode model comparative analysis imply end-to-end manner large volume fmri data may drive future development visual encoding
