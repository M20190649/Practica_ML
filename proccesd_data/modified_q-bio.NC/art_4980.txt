 statistical mechanic low-rank tensor decomposition often large high dimensional datasets collect across multiple modality organize high order tensor low-rank tensor decomposition arise powerful widely use tool discover simple low dimensional structure underlie data however currently lack theoretical understanding algorithmic behavior low-rank tensor decomposition derive bayesian approximate message pass amp algorithm recover arbitrarily shape low-rank tensor bury within noise employ dynamic mean field theory precisely characterize performance theory reveal existence phase transition easy hard impossible inference regime display excellent match simulation moreover reveal several qualitative surprise compare behavior symmetric cubic tensor decomposition finally compare amp algorithm commonly used algorithm alternate least square al demonstrate amp significantly outperforms al presence noise
