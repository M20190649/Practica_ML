 hybrid model large neural network description aim present paper efficiently describe membrane potential dynamic neural population form specie high density difference specific brain area propose hybrid model whose main ingredient conductance-based model ode system continuous counterpart pde system obtain limit process number neuron confine bounded region brain send infinity specifically discrete model cell low-density population individually describe set time-dependent variable whereas continuum model high-density population describe whole small set continuous variable depend space time communication among population translate interaction among discrete continuous model essence hybrid model present approach validate reconstruct ensemble activity granular layer network cerebellum lead computational cost reduction hybrid model reproduce interesting dynamic local microcircuit synchronization travel wave center-surround time-windowing
