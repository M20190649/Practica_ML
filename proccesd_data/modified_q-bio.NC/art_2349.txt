 dynamic large cooperative pulsed-coupled network study deterministic dynamic network n compose non identical mutually pulse-coupled cell assume weight asymmetric positive cooperative interaction among cell arbitrarily large value m. consider two case network 's graph complete graph existence large core i.e large complete subgraph first prove system periodically eventually synchronize natural spiking period p cell mutually structurally identical similar synchronization complete p second prove amount information h n generates process equal log p. therefore n completely synchronize information null finally prove n protect cell risk death
