 simulation large scale neural network evaluation application understand complexity biological neural network like human brain one scientific challenge century organization brain describe different level range small neural network entire brain region exist method description functionally effective connectivity base analysis relation activity different neural unit detect correlation information flow crucial step understand neural disorder like alzheimers disease causative factor evaluate estimation method necessary refer neural network known connectivity typically unknown natural biological neural network therefore network simulation also silico available work silico simulation large scale neural network establish influence different topology generate pattern neuronal signal investigate goal develop standard evaluation method neurocomputational algorithm realistic large scale model enable benchmarking comparability different study
