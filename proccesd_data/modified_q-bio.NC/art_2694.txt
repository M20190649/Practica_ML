 spectrum density large sparse random matrix associate neural network eigendecomposition couple matrix large biological network central study dynamic network neural network matrix reflect topology network conform dale 's law state neuron excitatory inhibitory output connection i.e. coefficient one column couple matrix must sign eigenspectrum density determine dense matrix j ij several population consider however expression derive assumption dense connectivity whereas neural circuit sparse connection follow mean-field approach order come exact self-consistent expression spectrum density limit sparse matrix symmetric neural network matrix furthermore introduce approximation allow good numerical evaluation density finally study phenomenology localization property eigenvectors
