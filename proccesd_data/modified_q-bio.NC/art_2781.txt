 characterize variability nonlinear recurrent neuronal network note develop semi-analytical technique obtain full correlational structure stochastic network nonlinear neuron describe rate variable assumption pair membrane potential jointly gaussian -- tend large network -- obtain deterministic equation temporal evolution mean firing rate noise covariance matrix solve straightforwardly give network connectivity also obtain spike count statistic fano factor pairwise correlation assume doubly-stochastic action potential firing importantly theory require fluctuation small work several biologically motivate convex single-neuron nonlinearities
