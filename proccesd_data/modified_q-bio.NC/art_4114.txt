 geometric structure fmri searchlight-based information map information mapping popular application multivoxel pattern analysis mvpa fmri information map construct use called searchlight method spherical multivoxel neighborhood every voxel i.e. searchlight brain evaluate presence task-relevant response pattern despite widespread use information map present several challenge interpretation one challenge infer size shape multivoxel pattern signature information map address issue formally examine geometric basis mapping relationship base geometric consideration show small pattern i.e. small spatial extent produce large signature information map compare large pattern independent size searchlight radius furthermore show number informative searchlight brain increase function searchlight radius even complete absence multivariate response pattern property unrelated statistical capability pattern-analysis algorithm use obligatory geometric property arise use searchlight procedure
