 uncover functional brain signature via random matrix theory brain organize modular way serve multiple functionality multiplicity require positive e.g excitatory phase-coherent negative e.g inhibitory phase-opposing interaction take place across brain module unfortunately method detect module time series either neglect convert positive measured negative correlation may leave significant part sign-dependent functional structure undetected present novel method base random matrix theory identification sign-dependent module brain method filter joint effect local unit-specific noise global system-wide dependency empirically obfuscate structure method guarantee identify optimally contrast functional signature i.e partition module positively correlate internally negatively correlate across method purely data-driven use arbitrary threshold network projection output statistically significant structure measurement neuronal gene expression biological clock mouse method systematically uncovers two otherwise undetectable negatively correlated module whose relative size mutual interaction strength find depend photoperiod neuron alternate two module define candidate region functional plasticity circadian modulation
