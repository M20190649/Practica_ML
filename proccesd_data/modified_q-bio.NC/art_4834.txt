 alleviate catastrophic forget use context-dependent gating synaptic stabilization human animal learn new task without forget old one however train artificial neural network anns new task typically cause forget previously learn task phenomenon result catastrophic forgetting train ann disrupt connection weight important solve previous task degrade task performance several recent study propose method stabilize connection weight anns deem important solve task help alleviate catastrophic forgetting draw inspiration algorithm believe implement vivo propose complementary method add context-dependent gating signal sparse mostly non-overlapping pattern unit active one task method easy implement require little computational overhead allow anns maintain high performance across large number sequentially present task combine weight stabilization work provide another example neuroscience-inspired algorithm benefit ann design capability
