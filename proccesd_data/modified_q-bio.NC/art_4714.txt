 frequency-based brain network multiplex framework full multilayer description explore study dynamical interaction brain region use functional multilayer network whose layer represent different frequency band brain operate specifically investigate consequence consider brain multilayer network brain region interact different frequency band instead multiplex network interaction different frequency band allow within brain region study second small eigenvalue combinatorial supra-laplacian matrix multilayer network detail thereby show heterogeneity interlayer edge especially fraction miss edge crucially modify spectral property multilayer network illustrate result synthetic network model real data set obtain rest state magnetoencephalography work demonstrate important issue construction frequency-based multilayer brain network
