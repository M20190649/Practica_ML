 double inverse stochastic resonance dynamic synapsis investigate behavior model neuron receive biophysically-realistic noisy post-synaptic current base uncorrelated spike activity large number afferent show static synapsis noise give rise inverse stochastic resonance isr function presynaptic firing rate compare case dynamic synapsis feature short-term synaptic plasticity show interval presynaptic firing rate isr exists extend diminish consider short-term depression facilitation interestingly find double inverse stochastic resonance disr two distinct well center different presynaptic firing rate appear
