 simple analysis sparse sign-consistent jl allen-zhu gelashvili micali shavit construct sparse sign-consistent johnson lindenstrauss distribution prove distribution yield essentially optimal dimension correct choice sparsity however analysis upper bound dimension sparsity require complicated combinatorial graph-based argument similar kane nelson 's analysis sparse jl present simple combinatorics-free analysis sparse sign-consistent jl yield dimension sparsity upper bound original analysis proof also yield dimension sparsity tradeoff previously know previous proof area analysis base apply markov 's inequality p th moment error term express quadratic form rademacher variable interestingly show unlike previous work area traditionally use hanson-wright bound strong enough yield desired result indeed although hanson-wright bound know optimal gaussian degree- chaos already show suboptimal rademachers surprisingly able show simple moment bound quadratic form rademachers sufficiently tight achieve desired result give ubiquity moment tail bound theoretical computer science likely broad interest
