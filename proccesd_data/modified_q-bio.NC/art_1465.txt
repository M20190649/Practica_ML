 predict task subject difference functional connectivity bold variability previous research find functional connectivity fc accurately predict identity subject perform task type task perform replicate result use large dataset collect osu center cognitive behavioral brain imaging also introduce novel perspective task subject identity prediction bold variability bv conceptually bv region-specific measure base variance within brain region bv simple compute interpret visualize show fc bv predictive task subject even across scan session separate multiple year subject difference rather task difference account majority change bv fc similar result fc show bv reduce cognitive task relative rest
