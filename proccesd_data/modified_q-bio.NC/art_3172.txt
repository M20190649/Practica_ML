 multiscale granger causality analysis trous wavelet transform since interaction neural system occur across multiple temporal scale likely information flow exhibit multiscale structure thus require multiscale generalization classical temporal precedence causality analysis like granger 's approach however computation multiscale measure information dynamic complicate theoretical practical issue filtering undersampling overcome problem propose wavelet-based approach multiscale granger causality gc analysis characterize following property candidate driver variable wavelet transformed ii decomposition perform use trous wavelet transform cubic b-spline filter measure gc give scale include wavelet coefficient driver time series scale regression model target validate method apply publicly available scalp eeg signal find condition closed eye rest characterize enhanced gc among channel slow scale w.r.t eye open condition whilst standard granger causality significantly different two condition
