 stimulus-dependent maximum entropy model neural population code neural population encode information stimulus collective fashion joint activity pattern spike silence full account mapping stimulus neural activity give conditional probability distribution neural codewords give sensory input able infer model distribution large-scale neural recording introduce stimulus-dependent maximum entropy sdme model -- -a minimal extension canonical linear-nonlinear model single neuron pairwise-coupled neural population model able capture single-cell response property well correlation neural spike due share stimulus due effective neuron-to-neuron connection show population retinal ganglion cell salamander retina respond temporal white-noise stimulus dependency cell play important encoding role result sdme model give accurate account single cell response particular outperforms uncoupled model reproduce distribution codewords emit response stimulus show sdme model conjunction static maximum entropy model population vocabulary use estimate information-theoretic quantity like surprise information transmission neural population
