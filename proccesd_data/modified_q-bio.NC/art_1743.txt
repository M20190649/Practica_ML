 interictal intracranial eeg predict surgical success importance space time predict post-operative seizure freedom use functional correlation network derive interictal intracranial eeg show success however important challenge consider electrode physically closer naturally tend correlated cause spatial bias implantation location number electrode differ patient make cross-subject comparison difficult functional correlation network vary time currently assume static study address three substantial challenge use intracranial eeg data patient intractable focal epilepsy patient additionally underwent preoperative mr imaging intra-operative ct post-operative mri allow accurate localisation electrode delineation removed tissue show normalise spatial proximity nearby electrode improve prediction post-surgery seizure outcome moreover patient extensive electrode coverage likely outcome predict correctly roc-auc p necessarily likely good outcome finally prediction robust regardless time segment future study account spatial proximity electrode functional network construction improve prediction post-surgical seizure outcome great coverage remove spar tissue allow prediction high accuracy
