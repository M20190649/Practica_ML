 neural ring algebraic tool analyze intrinsic structure neural code neuron brain represent external stimulus via neural code code often arise stereotype stimulus-response map associate neuron convex receptive field important problem confront brain infer property represented stimulus space without knowledge receptive field use intrinsic structure neural code brain address question important determine stimulus space feature principle extract neural code motivate u define neural ring related neural ideal algebraic object encode full combinatorial data neural code main finding object express canonical form directly translate minimal description receptive field structure intrinsic code also find connection stanley-reisner ring use idea similar theory monomial ideal obtain algorithm compute primary decomposition pseudo-monomial ideal allow u algorithmically extract canonical form associate neural code provide groundwork infer stimulus space feature neural activity alone
