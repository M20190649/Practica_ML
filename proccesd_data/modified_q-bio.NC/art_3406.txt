 nonequilibrium-potential approach competition neural population energy landscape useful aid understanding dynamical system valuable tool analysis broad class rate model neural network derive global lyapunov function provide energy landscape without symmetry constraint newly obtain nonequilibrium potential nep predicts high accuracy outcome dynamic globally stable case study common feature model class bistability -- implication work memory slow neural oscillation -- population burst also relevant neuroscience instead limit cycle find nonexistence prove resort bendixson -- dulac theorem least nep remain positive also generic singular limit model hopefully nep help understand average neural network dynamic formal standpoint also help description large heterogeneous neural network
