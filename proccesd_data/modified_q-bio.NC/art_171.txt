 burst firing neural code insect auditory system various class neuron alternate high-frequency discharge silent interval phenomenon call burst firing analyze burst activity insect system grasshopper auditory receptor neuron record vivo several distinct stimulus type experimental data show burst probability burst characteristic strongly influence temporal modulation acoustic stimulus tendency burst hence determine cell-intrinsic process also interaction stimulus time course study interaction quantitatively observe burst contain certain number spike occur shortly stimulus deflection specific intensity duration finding suggest sparse neural code information stimulus represent number spike per burst irrespective detailed interspike-interval structure within burst compact representation interpret firing-rate code information-theoretical analysis reveals number spike per burst reliably convey information amplitude duration sound transient whereas time occurrence reflect burst onset time investigated neuron encode almost half total transmitted information burst activity
