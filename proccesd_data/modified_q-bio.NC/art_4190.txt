 high-dimensional cluster analysis masked em algorithm cluster analysis face two problem high dimension first curse dimensionality lead overfitting poor generalization performance second sheer time take conventional algorithm process large amount high-dimensional data many application small subset feature provide information cluster membership one data point however informative feature subset may data point introduce masked em algorithm fit mixture gaussians model case show algorithm performs close optimally simulated gaussian data application spike sort high channel-count neuronal recording
