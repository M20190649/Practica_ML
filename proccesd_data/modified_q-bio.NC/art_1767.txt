 associative recall non-randomly diluted neuronal network potential associative recall diluted neuronal network investigate respect several biologically relevant configuration specifically position cell along input space spatial distribution connection first put asymmetric hopfield model onto scale-free barabasi-albert network geometrical diluted architecture map l-bit input pattern n -neurons network r n l adopt r consider distribution connection cell along one-dimensional input space follow normal distribution center cell sense cell close increase probability interconnect model also explicitly consider placement neuronal cell along input space way denser region space tend become denser therefore implement special case barabasi-albert connecting scheme obtained result indicate case consider stimulus noise network performance increase spatial uniformity cell distribution
