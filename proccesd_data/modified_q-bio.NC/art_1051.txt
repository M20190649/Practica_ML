 increase robustness pairwise method effective connectivity magnetic resonance imaging use fractional moment series bold signal distribution estimate causal interaction brain functional magnetic resonance image fmri data remain challenging task multiple study demonstrate current approach determine direction connectivity perform poorly even apply synthetic fmri datasets recent advance field include method pairwise inference involve create sparse connectome first step use classifier order determine directionality connection every pair node second step work introduce advance second step procedure build classifier base fractional moment bold distribution combine cumulants classifier train datasets generate dynamic causal model dcm generative model directionality infer base upon statistical dependency two node time series e.g assign causal link time series low variance time series high variance approach outperform performs well method effective connectivity apply benchmark datasets crucially also resilient confound effect differential noise level across different area connectome
