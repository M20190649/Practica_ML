 non markovian noise mediate anamolous diffusion within ion channel quite clear wide range experiment gate phenomenon ion channel inherently stochastic discuss use bd simulation recent paper memory effect ion transport negligible unless barrier height high brief report like state use differential stochastic method dsm 's markovian property exponential dwell time indeed give rise high barrier turn indicate memory effect need ignore thus construct generalized langevin equation contain combination non markovian different time scale markovian process develop algorithm describe scheme event see oscillatory function behaviour exponential decay obtain markovian limit two distinct time scale correspond process diffusion drift may obtain preliminary simulation result propose result need much inspection worthwhile reproduce use md simulation important idea like propose paper rise time scale memory effect may inherently relate differential behaviour shear viscosity cytoplasm extracellular matrix
