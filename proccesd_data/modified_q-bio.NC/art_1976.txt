 constraint satisfaction problem neural network statistical physic perspective new field research rapidly expand crossroad statistical physic information theory combinatorial optimization particular use cut edge statistical physic concept method allow one solve large constraint satisfaction problem like random satisfiability color error correction several aspect development relevant understanding functional complexity neural network one hand message passing procedure use new algorithm base local exchange information succeed solve hard computational problem hand crucial inference problem neurobiology like generate multi-electrode recording naturally translate hard constraint satisfaction problem paper give non-technical introduction field emphasize main idea work message passing strategy possible relevance neural network model also introduce new message passing algorithm infer interaction variable correlation data could useful analysis multi-electrode record data
