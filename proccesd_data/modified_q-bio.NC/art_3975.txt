 collective oscillation excitable element order parameter bistability role stochasticity study effect probabilistic refractory period collective behavior coupled discrete-time excitable cell sirs-like cellular automaton use mean-field analysis simulation show synchronized phase stable collective oscillation exist even non-deterministic refractory period moreover increase coupling strength lead reentrant transition synchronized phase lose stability intermediate regime also observe bistability consequently hysteresis synchronized phase active incoherent phase without oscillation onset oscillation appear mean-field equation neimark-sacker bifurcation nature i.e super- subcritical determine first lyapunov coefficient allow u determine border oscillating bistable region mean-field prediction thus obtain agree quantitatively simulation complete graph random graph qualitatively predict overall structure phase diagram latter obtain simulation define order parameter q suit detect collective oscillation excitable element briefly review commonly use order parameter show via data collapse q satisfy expected finite size scaling relation
