 information base centralization locomotion animal robot movement biology often achieve distributed control coupled subcomponents e.g muscle limb coupling could range weak local i.e decentralize strong global i.e centralize develop model-free measure centralization compare information share control signal global local state second measure call co-information quantify net redundant information control signal share state first validate measure simulation coupled oscillator show successfully reconstruct shift low high couple strength measure centralization freely run cockroach surprisingly extensor muscle activity middle leg informative movement leg combine movement particular leg cockroach centralization successfully recapitulate specific model strongly couple oscillator network previously use model cockroach leg kinematics segregate stride frequency slow cockroach stride exhibit shared information per stride control output state fast stride indicative information bandwidth limitation however centralization remain consistent two group use robotic model show centralization affect mechanical couple independent neural coupling mechanically coupled bounding gait decentralize become decentralized mechanical coupling decrease internal parameter control remain constant result system span design space centralization co-information use test biological hypothesis advise design robotic control
