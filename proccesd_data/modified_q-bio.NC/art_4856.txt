 complex network framework model cognition unveiling correlation structure connectivity several approach cognition intelligence research rely statistics-based model test namely factor analysis present work exploit emerge dynamical system perspective put focus role network topology underlie relationship cognitive process go couple model distinct cognitive phenomenon yet find condition mathematically equivalent find non-trivial attractor system correspond exact definition well-known network centrality hence stress interplay dynamic underlying network connectivity show two relevant connectivity structure cognitive process know yet regardless network consider always possible recover positive manifold correlation however show different network topology lead different plausible statistical model concern correlation structure range one multiple factor model rich correlation structure
