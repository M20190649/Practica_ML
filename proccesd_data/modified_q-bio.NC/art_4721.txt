 comment biologically inspire protection deep network adversarial attack recent paper suggest deep neural network protect gradient-based adversarial perturbation drive network activation highly saturated regime analyse saturate network show attack fail due numerical limitation gradient computation simple stabilisation gradient estimate enables successful efficient attack thus yet show robustness observe highly saturate network simply due numerical limitation
