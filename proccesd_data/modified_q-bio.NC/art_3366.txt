 discrete structure brain rhythms neuronal activity brain generate synchronous oscillation local field potential lfp traditional analysis lfps base decompose signal simpler component sinusoidal harmonic however common drawback method decomposition primitive usually presume onset may bias understanding signal 's structure introduce alternative approach allow impartial high resolution hands-off decomposition brain wave small number discrete frequency-modulated oscillatory process call oscillons particular demonstrate mouse hippocampal lfp contain single oscillon occupy theta -frequency band couple gamma -oscillons correspond respectively slow fast gamma -waves since oscillons identify empirically may represent actual physical structure synchronous oscillation neuronal ensemble whereas fourier-defined brain wave nothing poorly resolve oscillons
