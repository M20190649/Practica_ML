 spatial real virtual sound stimuli optimization auditory bci paper present result project aim create horizontally distribute surround sound source virtual sound image auditory bci abci stimulus purpose create evoked brain wave response pattern depend attended ignore sound direction propose use modified version vector base amplitude pan vbap approach achieve goal created spatial sound stimulus system novel oddball abci paradigm allow u create multi-command experimental environment encouraging result report paper also present result show modulation sound image depth change also subject response finally also compare propose virtual sound approach traditional one base real sound source generate real loudspeaker direction obtained result confirm hypothesis possibility modulate independently brain response spatial type depth sound source allow development novel multi-command abci
