 stimulus-dependent correlation threshold-crossing spiking neuron consider threshold-crossing spiking process simple model activity within population neuron assume neuron drive common fluctuating input gaussian statistic evaluate cross-correlation spike train pair model neuron different threshold correlation function tend asymmetric time indicate preference neuron low threshold fire one high threshold even input identical relationship result spike statistic model neural activity explore particular compare model integrate-and-fire model membrane voltage reset follow spike qualitative property spike cross correlation emerge threshold-crossing model similar burst event integrate-and-fire model particularly true generalized integrate-and-fire model spike tend occur burst observed example retinal ganglion cell drive rapidly fluctuate visual stimulus threshold cross model thus provide simple analytically tractable description event onset neuron
