 test boundary applicability quantum probabilistic formalism modeling cognition recently mathematical formalism quantum mechanic especially method quantum probability theory start widely use variety application outside physic e.g. cognition psychology well economy finance distinguish model genuine quantum physical model often call quantum-like although often people simply speak e.g. quantum cognition novel application generate number foundational question nowadays speak new science foundation quantum-like modeling first stage science mainly comparison classical quantum model mainly probabilistic setting find statistical data cognitive psychology violate basic constraint pose data classical probability theory kolmogorov particular constraint give formula total probability bell 's type inequality recently another question attract attention spite real success application reason believe quantum probability would cover completely problem e.g. cognition may general probability model explore similar problem attract lot attention foundation quantum physic culminate series experiment check sorkin 's equality triple-slit experiment weihs group note present similar test cognitive experimental setting performance test would either give confirmation adequacy quantum probability model cognitive application rejection conventional quantum model thus note open door series exciting experimental test quantum-like model cognition
