 natural statistic binaural sound binaural sound localization usually consider discrimination task interaural time itd level ild disparity pure frequency channel utilized identify position sound source natural condition binaural circuit expose stimulation sound wave originate multiple often move overlap source therefore statistic binaural cue depend acoustic property spatial configuration environment order process binaural sound efficiently auditory system adapt naturally encounter cue distribution statistic cue encounter naturally dependence physical property auditory scene study perform binaural recording three auditory scene vary spatial property analyze empirical cue distribution scene fit parametric probability density function allow easy comparison different scene high order statistic binaural waveform analyze perform independent component analysis ica study property learned basis function obtain result relate know neuronal mechanism suggest binaural hearing understand term adaptation natural signal statistic
