 adaptation current change threshold gain variability neuronal spike many type neuron exhibit spike rate adaptation mediate intrinsic slow mathrm k -currents effectively inhibit neuronal response adaptation current change relationship in-vivo like fluctuate synaptic input spike rate output spike train statistic however well understood computational study show adaptation current primarily depend subthreshold membrane voltage change neuronal input-output relationship i-o curve subtractively thereby increase response threshold spike-dependent adaptation current alter i-o curve divisively thus reduce response gain type adaptation current naturally increase mean inter-spike interval isi affect isi variability opposite way subthreshold current always cause increase variability spike-triggered current decrease high variability cause fluctuation-dominated input increase low variability average input large effect i-o curve match cause synaptic inhibition network asynchronous irregular activity find subtractive divisive change cause external recurrent inhibition respectively synaptic inhibition however always increase isi variability analytically derive expression i-o curve isi variability demonstrate robustness result furthermore show biophysical parameter slow mathrm k -conductances contribute two different type adaptation current find mathrm ca -activated mathrm k -currents effectively capture simple spike-dependent description muscarine-sensitive mathrm na -activated mathrm k -currents show dominant subthreshold component
