 signal propagation feedforward neuronal network unreliable synapsis paper systematically investigate synfire propagation fire rate propagation feedforward neuronal network couple all-to-all fashion contrast early work reliable synaptic connection consider mainly examine effect unreliable synapsis type neural activity propagation work first study network compose purely excitatory neuron result show successful transmission probability excitatory synaptic strength largely influence propagation two type neural activity good tuning synaptic parameter make consider network support stable signal propagation also find noise significant different impact two type propagation additive gaussian white noise tendency reduce precision synfire activity whereas noise appropriate intensity enhance performance fire rate propagation simulation indicate propagation dynamic consider neuronal network simply determine average amount receive neurotransmitter neuron time instant also largely influence stochastic effect neurotransmitter release second compare result obtain correspond feedforward neuronal network connect reliable synapsis random couple fashion confirm difference observe two different feedforward neuronal network model finally study signal propagation feedforward neuronal network consist excitatory inhibitory neuron demonstrate inhibition also play important role signal propagation consider network
