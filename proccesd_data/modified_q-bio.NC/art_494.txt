 electrocorticogram encoding upper extremity movement trajectory electrocorticogram ecog -based brain computer interface bci potentially control upper extremity prosthesis restore independent function paralyzed individual however current research mostly restrict offline decoding finger arm movement trajectory result modest study seek improve fundamental understanding ecog signal feature underlie upper extremity movement guide good bci design subject undergo ecog electrode implantation perform series elementary upper extremity movement intermittent flexion extension manner find movement velocity dot theta high positive negative correlation instantaneous power ecog high- gamma band hz flexion extension also correlation low idle epoch visual inspection ecog high- gamma band reveal power burst flexion extension event waveform strongly resemble corresponding flexion extension event see dot theta high- gamma burst present elementary movement spatially distribute somatotopic fashion thus conclude high- gamma power ecog strongly encode movement trajectory use input feature future bcis
