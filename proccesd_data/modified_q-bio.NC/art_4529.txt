 hierarchical internal representation spectral feature deep convolutional network train eeg decode recently increase interest research interpretability machine learning model example transform internally represent eeg signal brain-computer interface bci application help understand limit model may improve addition possibly provide insight data schirrmeister et al recently report promising result eeg decode deep convolutional neural network convnets train end-to-end manner causal visualization approach show learn use spectral amplitude change input study investigate convnets represent spectral feature sequence intermediate stage network show high sensitivity eeg phase feature early stage high sensitivity eeg amplitude feature late stage intriguingly observe specialization individual stage network classical eeg frequency band alpha beta high gamma furthermore find first evidence particularly last convolutional layer network learn detect complex oscillatory pattern beyond spectral phase amplitude reminiscent representation complex visual feature late layer convnets computer vision task finding thus provide insight convnets hierarchically represent spectral eeg feature intermediate layer suggest convnets exploit might help good understand compositional structure eeg time series
