 independent neuron represent finite set stimulus dependence mutual information number unit sample study capacity system independent neuron-like unit represent give set stimulus assume neuron provide fixed amount information information provide different neuron random overlap derive analytically dependence mutual information set stimulus neural response number unit sample large set stimulus mutual information rise linearly number neuron later saturates exponentially maximum value
