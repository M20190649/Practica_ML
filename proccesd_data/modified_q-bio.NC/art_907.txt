 multiplicative additive modulation neuronal tuning population activity affect encode information numerous study show neuronal response modulate stimulus property also state local network however little know activity fluctuation neuronal population modulate sensory tuning cell affect encoded information find fluctuation ongoing stimulus-evoked population activity primate visual cortex modulate tuning neuron multiplicative additive manner distribute continuum neuron strong multiplicative effect tend less additive modulation vice versa information encode multiplicatively-modulated neuron increase great population activity additively-modulated neuron decrease effect offset population activity little effect total information result thus suggest intrinsic activity fluctuation may act traffic light determine subset neuron informative
