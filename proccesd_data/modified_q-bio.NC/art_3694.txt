 neural population cod effective temporal classification neural encoding play important role faithfully describe temporally rich pattern whose instance include human speech environmental sound task involve classify spatio-temporal pattern spike neural network snns pattern encode directly influence difficulty task paper compare several exist temporal population cod scheme evaluate speech tidigits sound rwcp datasets show population neural coding encode pattern linearly separable use support vector machine svm note population neural coding effectively project temporal information onto spatial domain thus improve linear separability spatial dimension achieve accuracy tidigits rwcp datasets classify use svm respectively observation suggest effective neural cod scheme greatly simplify classification problem simple linear classifier would suffice datasets classify use tempotron snn-based classifier snn classification result agree svm finding population neural coding help improve classification accuracy hence learning algorithm effective neural encoding important snn design recognize spatio-temporal pattern often neglect powerful abstraction deserve study
