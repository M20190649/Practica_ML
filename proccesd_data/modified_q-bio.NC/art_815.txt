 unifying framework identification motor primitives long-standing hypothesis neuroscience central nervous system accomplishes complex motor behavior combination small number motor primitive many study last couple decade identify motor primitive kinematic kinetic electromyographic level thus support modularity different level organization motor system however study rely heterogeneous definition motor primitive different algorithm identification standard unsupervised learn algorithm principal component analysis independent component analysis non-negative matrix factorization advanced technique involve estimation temporal delay relevant mixture component apply plurality algorithm make difficult compare interpret result obtain across different study moreover different definition motor primitive relate never examine systematically propose comprehensive framework definition different type motor primitive single algorithm identification embed smoothness prior specific constraint underlying generative model algorithm identify many different type motor primitive assess identification performance algorithm simulate data set property primitive corresponding combination parameter know experimental electromyographic kinematic data set collect human subject accomplish goal-oriented rhythmic motor task identification accuracy new algorithm typically equal good accuracy unsupervised learn algorithm use previously identification type primitive
