 hub-activated signal transmission complex network wide range networked system exhibit highly connect node hubs prominent structural element functional role hub collective nonlinear dynamic many network however well understood propose hub neural circuit may activate local signal transmission along sequence specific subnetworks intriguingly contrast previous suggestion functional role hub hub non-hub subnetworks transfer signal core mechanism relies hub non-hubs providing activate feedback may thus induce propagation specific pulse rate signal neuronal communication network
