 make brain-machine interface robust future neural variability major hurdle clinical translation brain-machine interface bmi current decoder train small quantity recent data become ineffective neural recording condition subsequently change test whether decoder could make robust future neural variability train handle variety record condition sample month previously collect data well synthetic training data perturbation develop new multiplicative recurrent neural network bmi decoder successfully learn large variety neural-to- kinematic mapping become robust large train datasets test non-human primate preclinical bmi model decoder robust condition disable state-of-the-art kalman filter base decoder result validate new bmi strategy accumulate data history effectively harness may facilitate reliable daily bmi use reduce decoder retrain downtime
