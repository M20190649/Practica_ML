 quantify information transmit single stimulus shannon mutual information provide measure much information average contain set neural activity set stimulus extensively use study neural cod different brain area apply similar approach investigate single stimulus encode need introduce quantity specific single stimulus quantity define literature four different measure none satisfy intuitive property non-negativity additivity characterize mutual information present detailed analysis different meaning property four definition show measure satisfy least weak additivity condition i.e limit response set allow u use analyse correlated coding illustrate toy-example hippocampal place cell
