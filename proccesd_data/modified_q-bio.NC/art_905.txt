 effect passenger active head tilt opening closure eye motion sickness lateral acceleration environment car study examine effect passenger active head-tilt eyes-open closed condition severity motion sickness lateral acceleration environment car centrifugal head-tilt condition participant intentionally tilt head towards centrifugal force whereas centripetal head-tilt condition participant tilt head centrifugal acceleration eyes-open eyes-closed case investigate head-tilt condition experimental run sickness rating centripetal head-tilt condition significantly low centrifugal head-tilt condition moreover sickness rating eyes-open condition significantly low eyes-closed condition result suggest active head-tilt motion centrifugal acceleration reduce severity motion sickness eyes-open eyes-closed condition also demonstrate eyes-open condition significantly reduce motion sickness even head-tilt strategy use
