 perfect spike detection via time reversal spike neuronal network usually simulate three main simulation scheme classical time-driven event-driven scheme recent hybrid scheme three scheme evolve state neuron series checkpoint equally space first scheme determine neuron-wise spike event latter two time-driven hybrid scheme determine whether membrane potential neuron cross threshold end time interval consecutive checkpoint threshold crossing however occur within interval even test negative spike therefore miss present work derives implement benchmarks method perfect retrospective spike detection method apply neuron model affine linear subthreshold dynamic idea behind method propagate threshold time-inverted dynamic test whether threshold cross neuron state evolve rather vice versa algebraically translate set inequality necessary sufficient threshold crossing test slow imperfect one fast alternative perfect test base bisection root-finding method comparison confirms earlier result imperfect test rarely miss spike less fraction missed spike biologically relevant setting study offer alternative geometric point view neuronal dynamic
