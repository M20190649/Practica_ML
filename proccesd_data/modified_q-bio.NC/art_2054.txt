 maximally informative pairwise interaction network several type biological network recently show accurately describe maximum entropy model pairwise interaction also know ising model present approach find optimal mapping input signal network state allow network convey maximal information input signal draw give distribution mapping also produce set linear equation calculate optimal ising model couple constant well geometric property indicate applicability pairwise ising model show optimal pairwise interaction average zero gaussian uniformly distribute input whereas non-zero input approximate natural environment non-zero network interaction predict increase strength noise response function network node increase approach also suggest way interaction unmeasured part network infer parameter response function measured network node
