 find influential node integration brain network use optimal percolation theory global integration information brain result complex interaction segregated brain network identify influential neuronal population efficiently bind network fundamental problem system neuroscience apply optimal percolation theory pharmacogenetic intervention in-vivo predict subsequently target node essential global integration memory network rodent theory predict integration memory network mediate set low-degree node locate nucleus accumbens result confirm pharmacogenetic inactivation nucleus accumbens eliminate formation memory network inactivation brain area leave network intact thus optimal percolation theory predict essential node brain network could use identify target intervention modulate brain function
