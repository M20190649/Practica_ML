 systematic fluctuation expansion neural network activity equation population rate activity equation foundation common approach model neural network equation provide mean field dynamic firing rate activity neuron within network give connectivity shortcoming equation take account average firing rate leave high order statistic like correlation fire stochastic theory neural network include statistic order recently formulate describe theory yield systematic extension population rate equation introduce equation correlation appropriate coupling term level approximation yield close equation i.e depend upon mean specific correlation interest without ad hoc criterion show example all-to-all connect network system generalized activity equation capture phenomenon miss mean fieldrate equation alone
