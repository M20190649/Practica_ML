 compressive neural representation sparse high-dimensional probability paper show sparse high-dimensional probability distribution could represent neuron exponential compression representation novel application compressive sensing sparse probability distribution rather usual sparse signal compressive measurement correspond expect value nonlinear function probabilistically distributed variable expect value estimate sample quality compressed representation limit quality sampling since compression preserve geometric structure space sparse probability distribution probabilistic computation perform compressed domain interestingly function satisfy requirement compressive sensing implement simple perceptrons use perceptrons simple model feedforward computation neuron result show mean activity relatively small number neuron accurately represent high-dimensional joint distribution implicitly even without account noise correlation comprise novel hypothesis neuron could encode probability brain
