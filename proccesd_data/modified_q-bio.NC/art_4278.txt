 need know state-of-the-art computational model object-vision tour model model object vision great interest computer vision visual neuroscience last decade several model develop extract visual feature image object recognition task inspire hierarchical structure primate visual system others engineer model model vary several aspect model train supervision model train without supervision model e.g feature extractor fully hard-wired need training model come deep hierarchical structure consist several layer others shallow come one two layer processing recently new model develop hand-tuned trained use million image learn extract informative task-related feature survey different model provide reader intuitive well detailed understanding underlying computation model
