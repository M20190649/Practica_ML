 quantitative model presynaptic free calcium dynamic different stimulation protocols presynaptic free calcium dynamic neuron due various stimulation protocol investigate mathematical model model include calcium influx voltage-dependent calcium channel calcium buffering endogenous exogenous buffer well calcium efflux atp-driven plasma membrane calcium pump sodium calcium exchanger want support specific way model start level single protein protein represent characteristic determine single protein experiment consider widely independent neuron type allow application model different class neuron experiment procedure demonstrate single boutons pyramidal neuron rat neocortex corresponding fluorescence measurement koester sakmann j physiol. quantitatively reproduce model enable u reconstruct free calcium dynamic neuron would without fluorescence indicator start fluorescence data discuss different calcium response find high-frequency stimulation accumulation free calcium occur threshold stimulation frequency threshold frequency depend amount fluorescence indicator use experiment
