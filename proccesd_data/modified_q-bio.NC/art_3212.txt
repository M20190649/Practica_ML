 stimulus sensitivity spike neural network model recent paper relate criticality complex system maximal capacity information processing present paper consider high dimensional point process know age-dependent hawkes process use model spike neural network use mean-field approximation response network stimulus compute provide notion stimulus sensitivity appear maximal sensitivity achieve sub-critical regime yet almost critical range biologically relevant parameter
