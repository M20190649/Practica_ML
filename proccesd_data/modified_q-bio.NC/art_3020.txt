 joint statistic strongly correlate neuron via dimensional reduction relative timing action potential neuron record local cortical network often show non-trivial dependence quantify cross-correlation function theoretical model emphasize spike train correlation inevitable consequence two neuron part network share synaptic input non-linear neuron model however explicit correlation function difficult compute analytically perturbative method work weak share input order treat strong correlation suggest alternative non-perturbative method specifically study case two leaky integrate-and-fire neuron strong share input correlation function derive simulate spike train fit theoretical prediction accurately use method compute non-linear correlation transfer well correlation function asymmetric due inhomogeneous intrinsic parameter unequal input
