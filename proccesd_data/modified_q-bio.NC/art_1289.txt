 acetylcholine-modulated plasticity reward-driven navigation computational study neuromodulation play fundamental role acquisition new behaviour experimental finding show whereas acetylcholine bias hippocampal synaptic plasticity towards depression subsequent application dopamine retroactively convert depression potentiation previously demonstrate incorporate sequentially neuromodulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity stdp rule network model navigation yield effective learning change reward location characterize effect cholinergic depression behaviour find acetylcholine allow learn negative outcome influence exploration non-trivial manner highly depend specific model environment task interestingly sequentially neuromodulated stdp also yield flexible learning surpass performance reward-modulated plasticity rule
