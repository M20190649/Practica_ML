 design complex network suggest new perspective research towards understand relation structure dynamic complex network design network e.g modify feature unit interaction exhibit desired dynamic present case study positively answer question analytically network spike neural oscillator first present method find set network define mutual coupling strength exhibit arbitrary give periodic pattern spike invariant solution pattern spike time neuron exactly predefined method general cover network different type neuron excitatory inhibitory coupling interaction delay may heterogeneously distribute arbitrary network connectivity second show design network restriction impose instance predefining detailed network connectivity illustrate applicability method example erd s-r e nyi power-law random network third method use design network optimize network property illustrate idea design network exhibit predefined pattern dynamic time minimize network wiring cost
