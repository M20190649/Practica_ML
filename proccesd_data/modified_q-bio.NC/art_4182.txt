 chaotic balanced state large sparse circuit spike neuron exhibit balanced state highly irregular activity wide range condition occur likewise sparsely connected random network receive excitatory external input recurrent inhibition well network mixed recurrent inhibition excitation analytically investigate irregular dynamic finite network keep track individual spike time identity individual neuron delay purely inhibitory interaction show irregular dynamic chaotic fact stable moreover demonstrate long transient dynamic converges towards periodic orbit every generic periodic orbit dynamical system stable investigate collective irregular dynamic upon increase time scale synaptic response upon iteratively replace inhibitory excitatory interaction whereas small moderate time scale well excitatory interaction dynamic stay stable smooth transition chaos synaptic response become sufficiently slow even purely inhibitory network number excitatory interaction become large result indicate chaotic stable dynamic equally capable generate irregular neuronal activity generally chaos apparently essential generate high irregularity balanced activity suggest mechanism different chaos stochasticity significantly contribute irregular activity cortical circuit
