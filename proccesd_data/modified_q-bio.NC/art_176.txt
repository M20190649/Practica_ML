 dynamical statistical criticality model neural tissue nervous system work delicate balance excitation inhibition must achieve however balance seek global strategy mode remain balanced close instability mode strongly stable present simple model neural tissue balance seek locally neuron follow anti-hebbian behavior sl degree freedom achieve close balance excitation inhibition become critical dynamical sense long timescales mode model oscillate around instability line extremely complex breakout dynamic ensues different mode system oscillate prominence extinction show system develop various anomalous statistical behaviour hence becomes self-organized critical statistical sense
