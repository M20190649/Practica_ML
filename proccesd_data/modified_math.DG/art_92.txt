 semiintegrable almost grassmann structure present paper study locally semiflat also call semiintegrable almost grassmann structure establish necessary sufficient condition almost grassmann structure alpha- beta-semiintegrable condition express term fundamental tensor almost grassmann structure since able prove existence locally semiflat almost grassmann structure general case give many example alpha- beta-semiintegrable structure mostly four-dimensional example find system differential equation family integral submanifolds v alpha v beta distribution delta alpha delta beta plane element associate almost grassmann structure example able integrate system find closed form equation submanifolds v alpha v beta
