 curvature symmetry milnor sphere paper explore geometry topology cohomogeneity one manifold i.e manifold group action whose principal orbit hypersurfaces show principal group action every principal bundle extends cohomogeneity one action consequence prove every vector bundle every sphere bundle complete metric non-negative curvature well know exotic sphere dimension write bundle infinitely many way hence obtain infinitely many non-negatively curved metric exotic sphere consequence infinitely many almost free action i.e isotropy group finite action preserve hopf fibration extend disc also construct infinitely many action exotic -spheres mention
