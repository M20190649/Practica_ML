 vector sheaf associate principal sheaf framework abstract differential geometry show give principal sheaf representation stuctural sheaf n sheaf associative commutative unital algebra r c associate vector sheaf moreover natural assumption compatibility representation maurer-cartan logarithmic differential structural sheaf involve also show connection principal sheaf induce a-connections associated vector sheaf thus recover result classical differential geometry within purely algebro-topological context without smoothness assumption
