 invariant differential pairing paper notion m-th order invariant bilinear differential pairing introduce formal definition give manifold ahs structure various first order pairing construct yield classification first order invariant bilinear differential pairing homogeneous space ahs structure except certain totally degenerate case moreover high order invariant bilinear differential pairing construct homogeneous space lead classification complex projective space non degenerate case degenerate case correspond existence invariant linear differential operator
