 two gauss-bonnet poincar -hopf theorem orbifolds boundary goal work generalize gauss-bonnet poincar e -hopf theorems case orbifolds boundary present two generalization first spirit satake case local data i.e integral curvature case gauss-bonnet theorem index vector field case poincar e -hopf theorem relate satake 's orbifold euler characteristic rational number depend orbifold structure second pair generalization use chen-ruan orbifold cohomology express local data way relate euler characteristic underlying space orbifold case apply orbifolds admit almost-complex structure
