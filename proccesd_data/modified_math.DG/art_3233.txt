 scatter rigidity analytic riemannian manifold possible magnetic field consider compact riemannian manifold boundary endow magnetic field path take particle unit charge mass energy call magnetic geodesic show everything real-analytic topology metric magnetic field uniquely determine scatter relation magnetic geodesic flow measure boundary conjugate point allow minor restriction exchange real-analytic assumption prior result boundary rigidity greatly generalize
