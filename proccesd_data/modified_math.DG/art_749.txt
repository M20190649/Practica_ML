 discrete smooth orthogonal system c infty -approximation discrete conjugate system quadrilateral net planar face discrete orthogonal system define additional property face concircular geometric property allow one consider proper discretization conjugate resp orthogonal coordinate system classical differential geometry develop technique allow u extend know qualitative analogy rigorous convergence result particular prove c infty -convergence discrete conjugate orthogonal coordinate system smooth one also show construct approximate discrete net coordinate system transformation treat equal footing approximation result hold transformation well
