 topology open manifold radial curvature bound model surface finite total curvature example model surface construct surface revolution finite total curvature whose gauss curvature bound surface revolution employ reference surface comparison theorem radial curvature geometry moreover prove complete non-compact riemannian manifold homeomorphic interior compact manifold boundary manifold less curve non-compact model surface revolution total curvature model surface finite less pi hence first result mention may treat much wide class metric complete non-compact riemannian manifold whose sectional curvature bound constant
