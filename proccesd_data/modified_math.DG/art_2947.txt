 extrinsic holonomy lie algebra parallel submanifold investigate parallel submanifolds riemannian symmetric space n special case symmetric submanifold investigate many author well understood observe intrinsic property second fundamental form distinguish full symmetric submanifolds arbitrary full parallel submanifolds n usually call -fullness furthermore every parallel submanifold n consider pullback bundle tn induced connection admit distinguished parallel subbundle osc usually call second osculate bundle complete parallel submanifold n describe corresponding holonomy lie algebra osc mean second fundamental form curvature tensor n origin moreover n simply connect even full symmetric submanifold n calculate holonomy lie algebra tn explicit form
