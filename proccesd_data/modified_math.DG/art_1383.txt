 mass ricci flow paper study change adm mass ale space along ricci flow thus first show ale property preserve ricci flow show mass invariant flow dimension three similar result hold high dimension assumption consequence result following let g ale manifold dimension n g neq ricci flow start g euclidean space uniform limit
