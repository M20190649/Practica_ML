 lie contact structure chain lie contact structure generalize classical lie sphere geometry oriented hyperspheres standard sphere equivalently describe parabolic geometry correspond contact grading orthogonal real lie algebra follow underlying geometric structure interpret several equivalent way particular show give split-quaternionic structure contact distribution compatible levi bracket vein study geometry chain distinguish family curve appear parabolic contact geometry also system chain associate canonical parabolic geometry specific type exception low dimension turn obtain extension parabolic geometry associate lie contact structure latter locally flat case show chain never geodesic affine connection hence particular path geometry chain always non-trivial use appropriately fact conclude path geometry chain allows recover lie contact structure hence particular transformation preserve chain must preserve lie contact structure
