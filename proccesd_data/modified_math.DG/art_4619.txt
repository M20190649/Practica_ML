 pseudo-riemannian geodesic foliation circle investigate assumptions orientable pseudo-riemannian geodesic foliation circle generate -action construct example show contrary riemannian case always true however prove action always exist foliation contain lightlike leaf i.e pseudo-riemannian wadsley 's theorem application show every lorentzian surface whose spacelike timelike geodesic close finitely cover time r follow every lorentzian surface contain non-closed geodesic
