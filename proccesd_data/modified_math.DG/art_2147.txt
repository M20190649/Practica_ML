 jacobi field along harmonic -spheres integrable previous paper show jacobi field along harmonic map -sphere complex projective plane integrable i.e. tangent smooth variation harmonic map paper contrast show non-full harmonic map -sphere -sphere -sphere non-integrable jacobi field particularly surprising case -sphere space harmonic map degree smooth manifold map image totally geodesic -sphere
