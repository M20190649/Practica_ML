 curve flat pluriharmonic map constant curvature immersion pseudo-riemannian space form study two aspect loop group formulation isometric immersion flat normal bundle space form first aspect examine loop group map along different range loop parameter lead various equivalence global isometric immersion problem among different space form pseudo-riemannian space form corollary obtain non-immersibility theorem sphere certain pseudo-riemannian sphere hyperbolic space second aspect pursue clarify relationship loop group formulation isometric immersion space form pluriharmonic map symmetric space show object first class real analytic case extend pluriharmonic map certain symmetric space satisfy extra reality condition along totally real submanifold show construct pluriharmonic map general symmetric space curve flat use generalised dpw method
