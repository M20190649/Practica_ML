 k -minimal submanifolds recall submanifold riemannian manifold say minimal mean curvature zero classical minimal submanifolds critical point volume function paper examine critical point total k -th gauss-bonnet curvature function call k -minimal submanifolds prove characterize vanishing high mean curvature namely k -gauss-bonnet curvature furthermore show several property usual minimal submanifolds naturally generalize k -minimal submanifolds
