 harmonic morphisms solvable lie group paper introduce two new method construct harmonic morphisms solvable lie group first method yield global solution simply connected nilpotent lie group riemannian symmetric space non-compact type rank r ge second method provide u global solution damek-ricci space many non-compact riemannian symmetric space give continuous family -dimensional solvable lie group admit complex value harmonic morphisms even locally
