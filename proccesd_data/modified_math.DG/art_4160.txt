 stability convergence sasaki-ricci flow introduce holomorphic sheaf e sasaki manifold study two new notion stability e along sasaki-ricci flow relate jump number global holomorphic section e infinity first show mabuchi k-energy bound transverse riemann tensor bound c along flow c -infinity closure sasaki structure diffeomorphism group contain sasaki structure strictly global holomorphic section e sasaki-ricci flow converges exponentially fast sasaki-einstein metric secondly show futaki invariant vanishes low positive eigenvalue d-bar laplacian global section e bound away zero uniformly along flow sasaki-ricci flow converges exponentially fast sasaki-einstein metric
