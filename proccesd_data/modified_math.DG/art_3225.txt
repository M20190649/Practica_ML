 coherent tangent bundle gauss-bonnet formula wave front give definition coherent tangent bundle intrinsic formulation wave front application coherent tangent bundle wave front first fundamental form third fundamental form consider induced metric certain homomorphism vector bundle satisfy completely condition reverse role give wave front -manifold two gauss-bonnet formula exchange role fundamental form get two new additional gauss-bonnet formula third fundamental form surprisingly different first fundamental form use four formula get several new result topology geometry wave front
