 boundary regularity uniqueness non-uniqueness ah einstein metric -manifolds paper study several aspect asymptotically hyperbolic einstein metric mostly -manifolds prove boundary regularity infinity metric establish uniqueness natural condition boundary data examination explicit black hole metric show neither uniqueness finiteness hold general ah einstein metric prescribed conformal infinity describe natural condition sufficient ensure finiteness
