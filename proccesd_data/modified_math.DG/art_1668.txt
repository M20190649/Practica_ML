 g sphere -manifold present construction canonical g structure unit sphere tangent bundle give orientable riemannian -manifold m. structure never geometric -flat seem full possibility start study basic property construction structure co-calibrated einstein manifold fibre always associative fact associate -form result linear combination three volume -forms one volume fibre also give new example co-calibrated structure well know space hope contribute knowledge special geometry study -manifolds
