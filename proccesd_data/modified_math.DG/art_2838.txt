 example h -hypersurfaces h n time r geometric application paper describe rotation h -hypersurfaces h n time r use barrier prove existence characterization certain vertical h -graphs give symmetry uniqueness result compact h -hypersurfaces whose boundary one two parallel submanifolds slice also describe example translation h -hypersurfaces h n time r n obtain complete embed translation hypersurface generate compact simple strictly convex curve h frac n- n obtain complete non-entire vertical graph non-mean convex domain bound equidistant hypersurface take infinite boundary value data infinite asymptotic boundary value data
