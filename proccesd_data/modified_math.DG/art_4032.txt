 recovery c infty jet boundary distance funtion compact riemannian manifold boundary want find metric structure knowledge distance boundary point call boundary rigidity problem boundary concave mean locally short path lie entirely boundary able find taylor series metric tensor c infty jet boundary paper give new reconstruction procedure jet non-concave point boundary use localized boundary distance function closely related problem lens rigidity problem ask whether lens data determine metric structure uniquely lens data include information boundary distance function length geodesic location direction geodesic hit boundary give first examples show lens data uniquely determine jet example include two manifold boundary lens data different c jet additional careful work find examples different c jet mean boundary two lens-equivalent manifold different second fundamental form
