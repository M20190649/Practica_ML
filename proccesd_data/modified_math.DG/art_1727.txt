 global theory conformal finsler geometry aim present paper establish global theory conformal change finsler geometry change obtain relationship important geometric object associate l corresponding object associate tilde l widetilde l e sigma x l finsler conformal transformation find explicit global expression relate two associated cartan connection nabla widetilde nabla two associate berwald connection widetilde two associate barthel connection gamma widetilde gamma relationship corresponding curvature tensor also find relation thus obtain lead turn several interesting result among result obtain characterization conformal change characterization homotheties conformal invariant conformal sigma -invariants addition several useful identity find global theory conformal finsler geometry establish within pull-back approach make simultaneous use klein-grifone approach do via certain link find approach show two approach global finsler geometry alternative rather complementary although treatment entirely global local expression obtained result calculate coincide exist classical local result
