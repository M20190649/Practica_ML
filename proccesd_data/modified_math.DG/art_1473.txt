 coassociative -folds conical singularity paper dedicate study deformation coassociative -folds g manifold conical singularity stratify type deformation allow three problem main result problem state moduli space locally homeomorphic kernel smooth map smooth manifold case map question consider projection infinitesimal deformation space onto obstruction space thus obstruction moduli space smooth manifold furthermore calculate low bound expected dimension moduli space finally show weaken condition g structure ambient -manifold generic smoothness result moduli space deformation correspond second third problem
