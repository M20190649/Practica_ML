 simplicial approach derive differential manifold derive differential manifold construct use usual homotopy theory simplicial ring smooth function prove equivalent derive differential manifold finite type construct use homotopy sheaf homotopy ring d.spivak thus preserve classical cobordism ring reduction usual algebraic homotopy potentially lead virtual fundamental class beyond obstruction theory
