 deformation hypersurfaces preserve moebius metric reduction theorem hypersurface without umbilics n dimensional euclidean space know determine moebius metric moebius second fundamental form moebius transformation n paper consider moebius rigidity hypersurfaces deformation hypersurface preserve moebius metric high dimensional case n high multiplicity principal curvature less n- hypersurface moebius rigid deformable hypersurfaces possible deformation also classify completely addition establish reduction theorem characterize classical construction cylinder cone rotational hypersurfaces help find non-trivial deformable example classification wide application future
