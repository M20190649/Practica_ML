 introduction lie group isometric adjoint action generalization main purpose lecture note provide concise introduction lie group lie algebra isometric adjoint action aim mostly advanced undergraduate graduate student addition connection classic theory research area first author explore namely generalization isoparametric submanifolds polar action singular riemannian foliation section s.r.f.s mention first chapter cover basic concept give result adjoint representation close subgroup bi-invariant metric kill form split simple ideal following chapter proper isometric action recall together adjoint action foliation mostly concern weyl group normal slice dynkin diagram special focus give maximal torus root compact lie group explore connection isoparametric submanifolds polar action furthermore last chapter survey recent research result s.r.f.s give revised version detail fiber bundle proper isometric action explore exercise example add also feature new section example singular riemannian foliation construct surgery suspension homomorphism still preliminary version expect improve future would grateful kind suggestion
