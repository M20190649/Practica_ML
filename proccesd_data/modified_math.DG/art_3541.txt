 geometry isoparametric hypersurfaces riemannian manifold previous work study isoparametric function riemannian manifold especially exotic sphere one result say family isoparametric hypersurfaces closed riemannian manifold exist least one minimal isoparametric hypersurface note show minimal isoparametric hypersurface also unique family ambient manifold positive ricci curvature moreover give proof theorem claim q.m.wang without proof assert focal submanifolds isoparametric function complete riemannian manifold minimal study isoparametric hypersurfaces constant principal curvature general riemannian manifold turn case focal submanifolds property standard sphere i.e. shape operator respect normal direction common constant principal curvature necessary condition involve ricci curvature scalar curvature also derive
