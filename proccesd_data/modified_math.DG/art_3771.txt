 harmonic map heat flow rough boundary data let b unit open disk real closed riemannian manifold note first prove uniqueness weak solution harmonic map heat flow h time b whose energy non-increasing time give initial data u h b boundary data gamma u partial b previously uniqueness result obtain rivi e round sphere energy initial data small freire arbitrary close riemannian manifold give u h b gamma u partial b h partial b point uniqueness result boundary regularity assumption need second prove exponential convergence harmonic map heat flow assume energy small time
