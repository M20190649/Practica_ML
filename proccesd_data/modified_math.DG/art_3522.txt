 second variational formula functional int v g dv g note compute second variational formula functional int v g dv g introduce graham-juhl first variational formula obtain chang-fang also prove einstein manifold dimension ge positive scalar curvature strict local maximum within conformal class unless manifold isometric round sphere standard metric multiple constant note g locally conformally flat functional reduces well-studied int sigma g dv g hence result generalize previous result jeff viaclovsky without locally conformally flat restraint
