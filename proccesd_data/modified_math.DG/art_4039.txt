 sasaki-ricci flow compact sasakian manifold positive transverse holomorphic bisectional curvature show perelman 's w-functional generalize sasaki-ricci flow basic first chern class positive prove uniform bound scalar curvature diameter uniform c bound transverse ricci potential along sasaki-ricci flow generalize perelman 's result kahler-ricci flow sasakian setting also show positivity transverse holomorphic bisectional curvature preserve along flow use method result prove bando mok kahler setting particular show sasaki-ricci flow would converge sasaki-ricci soliton initial metric nonnegative transverse holomorphic bisectional curvature
