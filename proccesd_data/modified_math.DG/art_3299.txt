 symmetric space high rank admit differentiable compactifications nonpositively curve symmetric space admit topological compactification namely hadamard compactification rank one space topological compactification endow differentiable structure action isometry group differentiable moreover restriction action boundary lead flat model geometry conformal cr quaternionic cr depending space one ask whether differentiable compactification exists high rank space hopefully lead knew geometry explore paper answer negatively
