 subriemannian geometry sphere mathbb present paper start introduction quaternion define -dimmensional sphere set quaternion length one quaternion group induces mathbb structure noncommutative lie group group compact result obtain case different obtain case heisenberg group noncompact lie group like heisenberg group case introduce nonintegrable distribution sphere metric use two noncommutative left invariant vector field way mathbb become subriemannian manifold know group su isomorphic sphere mathbb represent example subriemannian manifold element matrix main issue study connectivity horizontal curve geodesic manifold paper use lagrangian method study connectivity theorem mathbb horizontal curve minimal arc-length show two point mathbb exist geodesic join two point
