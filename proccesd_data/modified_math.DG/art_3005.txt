 semi-riemannian manifold doubly warped structure investigate manifold obtain quotient doubly warp product show always cover product two suitable leaf allow u prove regularity hypothesis manifold doubly warped product zero measure subset form union leaf also obtain necessary sufficient condition ensure decomposition whole manifold use give sufficient condition geometrical nature finally study uniqueness direct product decomposition non simply connect case
