 remark rigidity case positive energy theorem proof positive energy theorem schoen yau show every asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface lorentzian manifold flat along isometrically imbed give second fundamental form minkowski spacetime graph function r n r particular diffeomorphic r n. short note give alternative proof fact argument generalise asymptotically hyperbolic case work every dimension n need spin structure
