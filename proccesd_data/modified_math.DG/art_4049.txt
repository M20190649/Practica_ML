 classification constant angle hypersurfaces warped product via eikonal function give warped product real line riemannian manifold arbitrary dimension classify hypersurfaces whose tangent space make constant angle vector field tangent real direction show natural setting extend previous result direction make several author moreover constant angle hypersurface graph riemannian manifold show function involve satisfy generalized eikonal equation solve via geometric method final part paper prove minimal constant angle hypersurfaces cylinder minimal submanifolds
