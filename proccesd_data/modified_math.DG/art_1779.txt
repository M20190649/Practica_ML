 gradient estimate positive solution conjugate heat equation ricci flow establish point-wise gradient estimate positive solution conjugate heat equation contrast perelman 's point-wise gradient estimate work mainly fundamental solution rather solution like perelman 's estimate general form gradient estimate require curvature assumption moreover assume low bound ricci curvature also prove localized gradient estimate similar li-yau estimate linear schr odinger heat equation main difference linear case assumption derivative potential scalar curvature need generalization perelman 's w-entropy define ricci flow fix metric case also find new family heat kernel estimate
