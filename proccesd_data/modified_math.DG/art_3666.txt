 gauss map constant mean curvature surface three-dimensional homogeneous space well-known surface -dimensional real space form constancy mean curvature equivalent harmonicity gauss map however true general surface arbitrary -dimensional ambient space paper study problem surface important natural family -dimensional ambient space namely homogeneous space particular obtain full classification constant mean curvature surface whose gauss map satisfy mild condition vertical harmonicity -dimensional homogeneous space
