 surface bounded mean curvature riemannian manifold consider sequence closed orientable surface fixed genus g riemannian manifold uniform upper bound mean curvature area show pass subsequence choose appropriate parametrisations inclusion map converge c map surface genus g also show pass subsequence distance function correspond pullback metric converge pseudo-metric fractal dimension two corollary obtain purely geometric result namely show bound mean curvature area genus surface f subset together bound geometry give upper bound diameter f proof model gromov 's compactness theorem j -holomorphic curve
