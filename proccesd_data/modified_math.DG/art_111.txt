 refine asymptotics constant scalar curvature metric isolated singularity consider asymptotic behaviour positive solution u conformal scalar curvature equation delta u n n- u n n- neighbourhood isolated singularity standard euclidean ball although asymptotic radial symmetry solution prove time ago caffarelli gidas spruck present much simpler geometric derivation fact also discuss refinement show solution asymptotic one deformed radial singular solution finally give application refine asymptotics first compute global pohozaev invariant solution sphere isolated singularity regularity moduli space solution
