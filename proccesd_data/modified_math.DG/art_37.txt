 motion weighted mean curvature affine invariant suppose curve move curvature plane one embed plane r look plane angle circle shrink round point would appear ellipsis shrink elliptical point '' surface energy would appear anisotropic would mobility result paper one use apparent surface energy apparent mobility motion weighted curvature mobility apparent plane motion curvature original plane view angle result apply isotropic case arbitrary surface energy function mobility plane surface -space case surface energy function twice differentiable case motion view distorted lens i.e. diffeomorphisms well result contrast early result state area-preserving affine transformation plane energy mobility also transform motion curvature power rather invariant
