 index formula bundle homomorphism tangent bundle vector bundle rank application previous work author introduce notion coherent tangent bundle useful give treatment singularity smooth map without ambient space two different type gauss-bonnet formula coherent tangent bundle -dimensional manifold prove several application surface theory give let n n ge oriented compact n -manifold without boundary tm n tangent bundle let mathcal e vector bundle rank n n varphi tm n mathcal e orient vector bundle homomorphism paper show one two gauss-bonnet formula generalize index formula bundle homomorphism varphi assumption varphi admit certain kind generic singularity shall give several application hypersurface theory moreover application intrinsic geometry also give characterization class positive semi-definite metric call kossowski metric realize induced metric coherent tangent bundle
