 classification warped product einstein metric paper take perspective introduce case-shu-wei study warped product einstein metric equation ricci curvature base space call equation base -quasi einstein equation also call lambda n -einstein equation paper extend work case-shu-wei early work kim-kim allow base non-empty boundary natural case consider since manifold without boundary often occur warped product manifold boundary case get interesting new canonical example also derive new formula involve curvature analogous gradient ricci soliton application characterize warped product einstein metric base locally conformally flat
