 logarithmic sobolev inequality along ricci flow derive logarithmic sobolev inequality along ricci flow without restriction time depend initial metric via rudimentary geometric data assume certain first eigenvalue positive consequence obtain uniform sobolev inequality along ricci flow without restriction time one application uniform kappa-noncollapsing estimate hold true time also obtain similar result bounded time without assume eigenvalue condition result extend ricci flow surgery
