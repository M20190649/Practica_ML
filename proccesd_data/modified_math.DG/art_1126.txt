 desingularizations calabi-yau -folds conical singularity study calabi-yau -folds conical singularity x model calabi-yau cone v. construct desingularizations obtain -parameter family compact nonsingular calabi-yau -folds limit way choose asymptotically conical calabi-yau -fold model cone v glue x apply homothety y. get -parameter family nearly calabi-yau -folds depend small real variable t. sufficiently small show nearly calabi-yau structure deform genuine calabi-yau structure therefore obtain desingularizations result apply resolve orbifold singularity hence provide quantitative description calabi-yau metric crepant resolution
