 warped product reissner-nordstrom metric study multiply warped product manifold associate reissner-nordstrom metric investigate physical property inside black hole event horizon show different uncharged schwarzschild metric ricci curvature component inside reissner-nordstrom black hole horizon nonvanishing einstein scalar curvature vanishes even interior charge metric introduce perfect fluid inside reissor-nordstrom black hole also show charge play effective role decrease mass-energy density pressure fluid inside black hole
