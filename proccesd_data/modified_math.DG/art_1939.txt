 cyclic rule lagrangian surface complex euclidean space study lagrangian surface complex euclidean space foliate circle straight line former call cyclic come three type one describe mean respectively planar curve legendrian curve -sphere legendrian curve anti de sitter -space also describe ruled lagrangian surface finally characterize cyclic ruled lagrangian surface solution self-similar equation mean curvature flow finally give partial result case hamiltonian stationary cyclic surface
