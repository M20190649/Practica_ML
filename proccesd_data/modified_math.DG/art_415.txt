 minimal surface attain equality chern-osserman inequality previous paper takahasi author generalize theory minimal surface euclidean n-space surface holomorphic gauss map certain class non-compact symmetric space also include theory constant mean curvature one surface hyperbolic -space moreover chern-osserman type inequality surface show though equality condition solve yet author notice equality condition original chern-osserman inequality find literature except case n spite importance paper simple geometric condition minimal surface attain equality chern-osserman inequality give author hope useful reference reader
