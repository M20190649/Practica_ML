 index dirac operator manifold fibered boundary let x compact manifold boundary suppose boundary total space fibration base fibre z. let generalized dirac operator associate phi-metric g x. assumption fully elliptic prove index formula d. proof two step first use result melrose rochon show index unchanged pass certain b-metric h positive real number next write b- i.e aps index formula h phi-index formula follow analyze limit behaviour go zero two term formula interior term study directly whereas adiabatic limit formula eta invariant follow work bismut cheeger
