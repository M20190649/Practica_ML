 lagrangian mean curvature flow entire lipschitz graph consider mean curvature flow entire lagrangian graph lipschitz continuous initial data assume certain bound lipschitz norm initial entire lagrangian graph r n show parabolic equation eqref pma lagrangian potential longtime solution smooth positive time satisfies uniform estimate away time particular mean curvature flow graph immediately become smooth solution exist time second fundamental form decay uniformly graph infty assumption lipschitz norm equivalent assumption underlie lagrangian potential u uniformly convex hessian bound l infty apply result prove bernstein type theorem translate soliton namely entire lagrangian graph smooth translate soliton must flat plane also prove convergence evolve graph additional condition
