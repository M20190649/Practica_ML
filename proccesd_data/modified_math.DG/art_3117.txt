 complete foliation space form hypersurfaces study foliation space form complete hypersurfaces mild condition high order mean curvature particular euclidean space obtain bernstein-type theorem graph whose mean scalar curvature change sign may otherwise nonconstant also establish nonexistence foliation standard sphere whose leaf complete constant scalar curvature thus extend theorem barbosa kenmotsu oshikiri general case em r- minimal foliation euclidean space possibly singular set able invoke theorem ferus give condition nonsigular leaf foliate hyperplanes
