 bifurcation set function definable o-minimal structure let g x smooth i.e c infty differentiable map two smooth manifold analogy case complex polynomial function say typical value g exist open neighbourhood u restriction g g u u c infty trivial fibration typical value g call atypical value g. denote b g bifurcation set g i.e set atypical value g. case complex polynomial function f c n c know b f finite set previously prove bifurcation set real polynomial function also finite aim note show bifurcation set b f smooth definable function f r n r finite
