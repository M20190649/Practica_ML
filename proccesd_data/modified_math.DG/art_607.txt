 almost quaternion-hermitian manifold follow point view gray hervella derive detailed condition characterize one class almost quaternion-hermitian n -manifolds n previously complete basic result a. swann give explicit description tensor contain space covariant derivative fundamental form omega split coderivative omega sl sp n sl sp -components n a. swann also prove information intrinsic torsion nabla omega contain exterior derivative sl omega thus give alternative condition express term sl omega characterize different class almost quaternion-hermitian manifold
