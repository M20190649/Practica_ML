 index constant mean curvature hypersurfaces simon introduce concept index hypersurfaces immerse euclidean sphere n intuitively index measure number independent direction give hypersurface fail minimize area early result regard index focus case minimal hypersurfaces many result establish low bound index recently however mathematician generalize result hypersurfaces constant mean curvature paper consider hypersurfaces constant mean curvature immerse sphere give low bound index new assumption immersed manifold
