 ricci flow k hler-einstein manifold previous paper math.dg develop new technique attack convergence problem k ahler ricci flow one main idea find set new functionals curvature tensor ricci flow gradient like flow functionals successfully find functionals case kaehler manifold k ahler-einstein manifold positive scalar curvature initial metric positive bisectional curvature prove functionals uniform low bound via effective use tian 's inequality consequently prove following theorem let k ahler-einstein manifold positive scalar curvature initial metric nonnegative bisectional curvature positive least one point k ahler ricci flow converge exponentially fast k ahler-einstein metric constant bisectional curvature result hold k ahler-einstein orbifolds
