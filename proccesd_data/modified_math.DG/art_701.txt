 deformation g spin structure manifold consider infinitesmal global deformation g structure -manifolds discover canonical way deform g structure vector field associate metric get twist way vector cross product present system partial differential equation unknown vector field whose solution would yield manifold holonomy g similarly consider analogous construction spin structure -manifolds result carry directly others increase non-linearity spin case
