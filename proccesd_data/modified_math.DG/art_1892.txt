 nonexistence spacelike foliation dominant energy condition lorentzian geometry show many lorentzian manifold dimension admit spacelike codimension-one foliation almost every manifold dimension admit lorentzian metric admits one satisfy dominant energy condition timelike convergence condition two seemingly unrelated statement fact origin also discuss problem topology change general relativity theorem tipler say topology change impossible via spacetime cobordism whose ricci curvature satisfy strict lightlike convergence condition theorem boundary cobordism require spacelike show topology change strict lightlike convergence condition also dominant energy condition possible many case one require instead exist timelike vector field transverse boundary
