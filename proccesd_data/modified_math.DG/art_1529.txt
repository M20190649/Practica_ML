 calabi flow first give precise statement short time existence calabi flow prove stability result metric near constant scalar curvature metric flow csck metric exponentially fast secondly prove compactness theorem space kahler metric give unifrom ricci bound potential bound application prove calabi flow extend ricci curvature stay uniformly bound lastly prove removing-sigularity result weak constant scalar curveture metric punctured ball one main difficulty metric assume smooth outside singular point
