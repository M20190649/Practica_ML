 periodic geodesic geometry compact lorentzian manifold kill vector field study geometry periodic geodesic compact lorentzian manifold kill vector field timelike somewhere use compactness argument subgroup isometry group prove existence one timelike non self-intersecting periodic geodesic kill vector field never vanish least two distinct periodic geodesic special case compact stationary manifold least two periodic timelike geodesic also discuss property topology manifold particular show compact manifold admit lorentzian metric never vanish kill vector field timelike somewhere admit smooth circle action without fixed point
