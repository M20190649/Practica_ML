 geometry genus-one helicoids prove properly embed genus-one minimal surface asymptotic helicoid contain two straight line must intersect helicoid precisely two line particular two line divide surface two connected component lie either side helicoid prove analogous result periodic helicoid-like surface also give simple condition guarantee immersed minimal surface finite genus bounded curvature asymptotic helicoid infinity
