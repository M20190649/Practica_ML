 time-like salkowski anti-salkowski curve minkowski space e salkowski cite salkow one century ago introduce family curve constant curvature non-constant torsion salkowski curve family curve constant torsion non-constant curvature anti-salkowski curve euclidean -space e paper adapt definition curve time-like curve minkowski -space e thereafter introduce explicit parametrization time-like salkowski curve time-like anti-salkowski curve minkowski space e also characterize space curve constant curvature constant torsion whose normal vector make constant angle fixed line
