 harmonic morphisms homogeneous hadamard manifold present new method manufacture complex-valued harmonic morphisms wide class riemannian lie group yield new solution important family homogeneous hadamard manifold also give new method construct left-invariant foliation large class lie group produce harmonic morphisms
