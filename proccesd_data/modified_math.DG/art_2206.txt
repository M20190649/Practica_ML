 isospectral orbifolds different maximal isotropy order construct pair compact riemannian orbifolds isospectral laplace operator function maximal isotropy order singular point one orbifolds high one type example isospectrality arises version famous sunada theorem also imply isospectrality p -forms orbifolds quotient certain compact normal homogeneous space another type example orbifolds quotient euclidean r show isospectral function use dimension formula eigenspaces latter type example orbifolds isospectral -forms along way also give several additional example isospectral orbifolds maximal isotropy group different size interesting property
