 existence uniqueness constant mean curvature sphere sol study classification immersed constant mean curvature cmc sphere homogeneous riemannian -manifold sol i.e. thurston -dimensional geometry problem remain open main result state every h sqrt exist unique left translation immerse cmc h sphere h sol hopf-type theorem moreover sphere h embed therefore unique left translation compact embed cmc h surface sol alexandrov-type theorem uniqueness part result also obtain real number h exist solution isoperimetric problem mean curvature h
