 isoperimetric inequality minimal submanifolds riemannian manifold counterexample high codimension compact riemannian manifold convex boundary b.white prove following alternative either isoperimetric inequality minimal hypersurfaces exist closed minimal hypersurface possibly small singular set natural question similar result true submanifolds high codimension specifically b.white ask non-existence isoperimetric inequality k-varifolds implies existence nonzero stationary integral k-varifold present example show true codimension great two key step construction riemannian metric closed four-dimensional ball b follow property b strictly convex boundary exist complete nonconstant geodesic exist closed geodesic b
