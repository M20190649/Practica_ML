 homogeneous structure rigidity isoparametric submanifolds hilbert space study isoparametric submanifolds rank least two separable hilbert space know homogeneous result heintze liu associate submanifold point x canonical homogeneous structure certain bilinear map tangent space prove homogeneous structure together second fundamental form encode information deduce rigidity result completely determine second fundamental form covariant derivative thereby make submanifolds accessible classification essential step show one-parameter group isometry construct heintze liu prove homogeneity induce smooth hence everywhere define kill field imply continuity homogeneous structure important tool introduction affine root system isoparametric submanifolds
