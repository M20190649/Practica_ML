 dense g-delta set riemannian metric without finite block property pair point x riemannian manifold g say finite blocking property finite set p contain x every geodesic segment x pass point p. show every closed c-infinity manifold dimension least two every pair x x exist dense g-delta set c-infinity riemannian metric x fail finite blocking property every g set
