 asymptotic theorem minimal surface existence result minimal graph h time r paper prove general sharp asymptotic theorem minimal surface h time r consequence prove properly immerse minimal surface whose asymptotic boundary c jordan curve homologous zero asymptotic boundary h time r say partial infty h time r c contain slab two horizontal circle partial infty h time r width equal pi construct minimal vertical graph h time r certain unbounded admissible domain take certain prescribed finite boundary data certain prescribed asymptotic boundary data admissible unbounded domain om h time non necessarily convex non necessarily bound convex arc component boundary properly embed zero one two point asymptotic boundary satisfy geometric condition
