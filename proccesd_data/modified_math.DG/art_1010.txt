 class kaehler einstein structure cotangent bundle use natural lift define cotangent bundle riemannian manifold g order construct almost hermitian structure g j diagonal type obtained almost complex structure j integrable base manifold constant sectional curvature coefficient well derivative involve definition fulfill certain algebraic relation next one obtain condition must fulfil case obtain almost hermitian structure almost kaehlerian combine obtained result get family kaehlerian structure depend two essential parameter next study three condition consider kaehlerian structure einstein one obtained case get g j constant holomorphic curvature
