 -quasi-sasakian manifold present paper carry systematic study -quasi-sasakian manifold particular prove three reeb vector field generate involutive distribution determine canonical totally geodesic riemannian foliation locally leaf foliation turn lie group either orthogonal group abelian one show -quasi-sasakian manifold well-defined rank obtain rank-based classification furthermore prove splitting theorem manifold assume integrability one almost product structure finally show vertical distribution minimum correct energy
