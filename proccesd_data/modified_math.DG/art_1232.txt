 extrinsic geometry unit normal vector field riemannian hyperfoliations consider unit normal vector field local hyperfoliation give riemannian manifold submanifold unit tangent bundle sasaki metric give explicit expression second fundamental form submanifold rather simple condition totally geodesic property case totally umbilic hyperfoliation corresponding example show non-triviality condition -dimensional case give complete description riemannian manifold admit geodesic unit vector field totally geodesic property
