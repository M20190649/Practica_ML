 deform metric foliation result concern geometry manifold endow pair complementary orthogonal distribution plane field time-dependent riemannian metric work begin formulae concern deformation geometric quantity riemannian metric varies conformally along one distribution introduce extrinsic geometric flow depend mean curvature vector field distribution show existence uniquenes convergence solution infty complementary distribution integrable compact leaf apply method problem prescribe mean curvature vector field foliation give example harmonic umbilical foliation double-twisted product metric include codimension-one case
