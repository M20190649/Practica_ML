 distinguish torsion curvature deflection tensor multi-time hamilton geometry aim paper present main geometrical object dual -jet bundle j cal polymomentum phase space de donder-weyl covariant hamiltonian formulation field theory characterize approach multi-time hamilton geometry direction firstly introduce geometrical concept nonlinear connection n dual -jet space j cal start give n -linear connection j cal describe adapted component torsion curvature deflection distinguish tensor attach n -linear connection
