 space k hler metric iv -- low bound k-energy partially confirm old conjecture donaldson exist csck metric give k ahler class degenerated geodesic ray tame bounded ambient geometry unless parallel holomorphic line consist csck metric also prove simple test configuration central fibre csck metric k energy functionals nearby fibre must also uniform low bound underlying k ahler class
