 uniform approximation continuous function smooth function critical point hilbert manifold prove every continuous function separable infinite-dimensional hilbert space x uniformly approximate smooth function critical point kind result regard sort strong approximate version morse-sard theorem consequence main theorem follow every two disjoint close subset x separate one-codimensional smooth manifold level set smooth function critical point fact may view nonlinear analogue geometrical version hahn-banach theorem particular every closed set x uniformly approximate open set whose boundary smooth one-codimensional submanifolds x. finally since every hilbert manifold diffeomorphic open subset hilbert space result still hold one replace hilbert space x smooth manifold model x
