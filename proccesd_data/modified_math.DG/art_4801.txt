 monotonicity formula vanish theorem geometric application use stress energy tensor establish monotonicity formula vector bundle-valued p-forms satisfy conservation law provide base riemannian resp k ahler manifold po real resp complex p-exhaustion function vanish theorem follow immediately monotonicity formula suitable growth condition energy p-forms application establish monotonicity formula ricci form k ahler manifold constant scalar curvature get growth condition derive ricci flatness k ahler manifold particular curvature change sign k ahler manifold isometrically biholomorphic c m. another application deduce monotonicity formula volume minimal submanifolds outer space suitable exhaustion function way recapture classical volume monotonicity formula minimal submanifolds euclidean space also apply vanish theorem bernstein type problem submanifolds euclidean space parallel mean curvature particular may obtain bernstein type result minimal submanifolds especially minimal real k ahler submanifolds weak condition
