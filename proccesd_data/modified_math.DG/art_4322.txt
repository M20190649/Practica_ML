 penrose-type inequality euclidean background riemannian penrose inequality rpi bound adm mass asymptotically flat manifold nonnegative scalar curvature term total area outermost compact minimal surface general form rpi currently know manifold dimension seven present work prove penrose-like inequality valid dimension conformally flat manifold inequality treat area contribution minimal surface favorable way rpi expense use small euclidean area rather intrinsic area give example estimate sharp rpi many minimal surface present require minimal surface outermost also generalize technique allow metric conformal scalar-flat necessarily euclidean background prove penrose-type inequality without assumption sign scalar curvature finally derive new low bound adm mass conformally flat asymptotically flat manifold contain number zero area singularity
