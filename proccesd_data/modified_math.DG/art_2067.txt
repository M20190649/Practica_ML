 half-space theorem embed minimal annulus minimal graph heisenberg group construct one-parameter family properly embed minimal annulus heisenberg group nil endow left-invariant riemannian metric annulus rotationally invariant family give vertical half-space theorem prove complete minimal graph nil entire also sister surface entire minimal graph nil entire constant mean curvature graph h x r conversely give classification entire constant mean curvature graph h x r. finally construct properly embed constant mean curvature annulus h x r
