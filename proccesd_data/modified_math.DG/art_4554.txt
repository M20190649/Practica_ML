 high rank rigidity theorem manifold focal point say riemannian manifold rank least k every geodesic admits least k parallel jacobi field rank rigidity theorem ballmann burns-spatzier later generalize eberlein-heber state complete irreducible simply connected riemannian manifold rank least high rank assumption whose isometry group satisfy condition recurrent vector dense unit tangent bundle sm duality condition symmetric space noncompact type include example high rank admit finite volume quotient adapt method ballmann eberlein-heber prove generalization theorem manifold assume focal point use theorem generalize focal point result ballmann-eberlein stating compact manifold nonpositive curvature rank invariant fundamental group
