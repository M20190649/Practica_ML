 sharp low bound density area-minimizing cone prove density topologically nontrivial area-minimizing hypercone isolated singularity must great square root simon cone show best possible constant one component complement cone nontrivial kth homotopy group prove good bound term k bound also best possible proof use mean curvature flow
