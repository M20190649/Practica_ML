 positively curve -manifolds -symmetry well-known work hsiang kleiner every close orient positively curve -dimensional manifold effective isometric -action homeomorphic cp state topological classification primary goal paper show indeed diffeomorphism classification -dimensional manifold proof diffeomorphism classification also show even strong statement every positively curve simply connect -manifold isometric circle action admit another smooth circle action extend -dimensional torus action equivariantly diffeomorphic linear action cp main strategy analyze possible topological configuration effective circle action simply connect -manifolds use so-called replacement trick pao
