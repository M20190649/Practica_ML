 three-manifolds constant vector curvature connected riemannian manifold constant vector curvature epsilon denote cvc epsilon every tangent vector v tm lie -plane sectional curvature epsilon scale metric always assume epsilon sectional curvature satisfy additional bound sectional curvature less equal epsilon sectional curvature great equal epsilon say epsilon extremal curvature paper study three-manifolds constant vector curvature main result show finite volume cvc epsilon three-manifolds extremal curvature epsilon locally homogenous epsilon admit local product decomposition epsilon application deduce hyperbolic rank-rigidity theorem
