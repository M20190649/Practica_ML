 geodesic equivalence riemannian metric sub-riemannian metric distribution corank present paper devote problem local geodesic equivalence riemannian metric sub-riemannian metric generic corank distribution use pontryagin maximum principle treat riemannian sub-riemannian case unified way obtain algebraic necessary condition geodesic equivalence sub- riemannian metric way first obtain new elementary proof classical levi-civita 's theorem classification riemannian geodesically equivalent metric neighborhood so-called regular stable point w.r.t metric secondly prove sub-riemannian metric contact distribution geodesically equivalent iff constantly proportional describe geodesically equivalent sub-riemannian metric quasi-contact distribution finally make classification pair geodesically equivalent riemannian metric surface proportional isolated point simple case cover levi-civita 's theorem
