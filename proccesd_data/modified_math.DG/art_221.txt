 new homogeneous einstein metric negative ricci curvature construct new homogeneous einstein space negative ricci curvature two way first give method classify construct class rank one einstein solvmanifolds whose derive algebra two-step nilpotent application describe explicit continuous family ten-dimensional einstein manifold two-dimensional parameter space include continuous subfamily manifold negative sectional curvature secondly obtain new example non-symmetric einstein solvmanifolds modify algebraic structure non-compact irreducible symmetric space rank great one preserve constant ricci curvature
