 lecture mean curvature flow high codimensions mean curvature flow hypersurfaces extensively study various different approach many beautiful result however relatively little know mean curvature flow submanifolds high codimensions note start basic material submanifold geometry introduces mean curvature flow general dimension co-dimensions related technique called blow-up analysis also discuss end present global existence convergence result mean curvature flow two-dimensional surface four-dimensional ambient space
