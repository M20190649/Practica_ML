 structure complex homogeneous supermanifolds lie group g closed lie subgroup h subset g well know coset space g h equip structure manifold homogeneous g g -homogeneous manifold isomorphic one kind interesting problem find analogue result case supermanifolds classical setting g real complex lie group g h real respectively complex manifold g real lie supergroup h subset g closed lie subsupergroup natural way consider g h supermanfold furthermore g -homogeneous real supermanifold obtain way see cite kostant goal paper give proof result complex case
