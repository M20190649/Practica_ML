 cmc- trinoids hyperbolic -space metric constant curvature one conical singularity -sphere cmc- trinoids i.e constant mean curvature one immerse surface three regular embed end hyperbolic -space h irreducible generically irreducible one classify however reducible case yet fully treat paper give explicit description cmc- trinoids h include reducible case
