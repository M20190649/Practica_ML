 lattice contact lie group -dimensional contact solvmanifolds paper investigate geometry compact contact manifold uniformize contact lie group i.e. compact manifold quotient lie group g left invariant contact structure uniform lattice subgroup re-examine alexander 's criterion existence lattice solvable lie group apply along well know tool use result prove dimension exactly seven connect simply connect contact lie group uniform lattice solvable issue symplectic boundary explore well also show special affine group uniform lattice
