 uniformization theorem complete noncompact k hler surface positive bisectional curvature paper combine technique ricci flow algebraic geometry prove following generalization classical uniformization theorem riemann surface give complete noncompact complex two dimensional k ahler manifold positive bound holomorphic bisectional curvature suppose geodesic ball euclidean volume growth scalar curvature decay zero infinity average sense biholomorphic c proof also discover interesting gap phenomenon say k ahler manifold automatically quadratic curvature decay infinity average sense
