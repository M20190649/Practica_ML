 differential geometry via harmonic function talk discuss use harmonic function study geometry topology complete manifold previous joint work luen-fai tam discover number infinity complete manifold estimate dimension certain space harmonic function apply complete manifold whose ricci curvature almost non-negative show manifold must finitely many end recent joint work jiaping wang successfully apply general method two class complete manifold first class manifold low bound spectrum lambda whose ricci curvature bound ric ge m- m- lambda second class stable minimal hypersurfaces complete manifold non-negative sectional curvature case prove splitting type theorem also finiteness theorem
