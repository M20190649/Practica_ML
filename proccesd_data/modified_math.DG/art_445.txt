 update harmonic map finite uniton number via zero curvature equation primarily survey development theory harmonic map finite uniton number unitons take place since introduction extended solution uhlenbeck map include harmonic map two-sphere compact lie group symmetric space extend solution equivalent harmonic map advantage extended solution fact solution zero curvature equation closely related complex extend solution complex extend frame fact even advantageous point dorfmeister pedit wu use review exist theory also prove new result concern harmonic map unitary group
