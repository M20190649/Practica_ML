 asymptotic estimate time derivative -entropy riemannian manifold note obtain asymptotic estimate time derivative phi -entropy term low bound bakry-emery gamma curvature case hyperbolic space heisenberg group show time derivative phi -entropy non-increasing also get sharp asymptotic bound time derivative entropy heisenberg group
