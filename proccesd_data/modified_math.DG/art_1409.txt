 flat front hyperbolic -space caustic galvez martinez milan discover weierstrass-type holomorphic representation formula flat surface hyperbolic -space first third fourth author give framework complete flat front singularity h present work broaden notion completeness weak completeness front p-front front p-front completeness implies weak completeness new framework result apply general class flat surface general class contain caustic flat front -- show also flat roitman give holomorphic representation formula -- important class surface generally complete weakly complete furthermore although flat front globally define normal caustic might make flat front locally hence p-fronts use new framework obtain characterization caustic
