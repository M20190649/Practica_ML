 differential geometry monopole modulus space thesis motivate desire understand natural geometry hyperbolic monopole modulus space take two approach firstly develop twistor theory singular hyperbolic monopoles use study geometry charge modulus space introduce new way study modulus space euclidean hyperbolic monopoles apply kodaira 's deformation theory spectral curve obtain new result euclidean hyperbolic case particular prove new cohomology vanish theorem find hyperbolic monopole modulus space appear carry new type geometry whose complexification similar complexification hyperk ahler geometry different reality condition
