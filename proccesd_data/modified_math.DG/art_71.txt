 group symplectic automorphisms c p time c p n let product c p c p n standard integral symplectic form prove inclusion map group symplectic automorphisms diffeomorphism group surjective homotopy group precisely surjective pi j odd j leq max m- n- weak higher-dimensional analogue gromov 's result c p time c p proof use parametrized gromov-witten invariant new way also give information symplectic automorphism group differently weight product symplectic structure
