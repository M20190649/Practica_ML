 constant mean curvature hypersurfaces condense along submanifold give nondegenerate k-dimensional minimal submanifold k codimension great prove existence family constant mean curvature submanifolds mean curvature vary one member family another condense k. particular result prove existence constant mean curvature hypersurfaces nontrivial topology riemannian manifold
