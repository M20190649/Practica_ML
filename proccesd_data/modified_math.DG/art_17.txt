 geodesic conjugacy two-step nilmanifolds two riemannian manifold say c k -conjugate geodesic flow exist c k diffeomorphism unit tangent bundle intertwine geodesic flow obtain number rigidity result geodesic flow compact -step riemannian nilmanifolds generic -step nilmanifolds geodesic flow c rigid special class -step nilmanifolds show geodesic flow c c rigid particular exist continuous family -step nilmanifolds whose laplacians isospectral whose geodesic flow c conjugate
