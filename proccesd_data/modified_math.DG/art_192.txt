 almost rigidity manifold low bound ricci curvature minimal volume growth consider complete noncompact riemannian manifold quadratically decay low ricci curvature bound minimal volume growth first prove rigidity result show end strongly minimal volume growth isometric warp product manifold next consider almost rigid case manifold nonnegative quadratically decay low ricci curvature bound minimal volume growth compact region manifold show asymptotically close warped product gromov-hausdorff topology manifold nonnegative ricci curvature linear volume growth show region asymptotically close isometric product proof involve careful analysis busemann function manifold use recently develop cheeger-colding almost rigidity theory addition show diameter level set busemann function manifold grow sublinearly
