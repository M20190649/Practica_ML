 mean curvature flow surface einstein four-manifolds let sigma compact oriented surface immerse four dimensional k ahler-einstein manifold m. consider evolution sigma direction mean curvature vector prove symplectic preserve along flow flow develop type singularity two parallel k ahler form omega omega '' determine different orientation sigma symplectic respect omega omega '' prove mean curvature flow sigma exists smoothly time positive curvature case flow indeed converge infinity
