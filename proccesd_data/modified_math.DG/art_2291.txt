 poisson structure generalize kahler structure let x compact kahler manifold non-trivial holomorphic poisson structure exist deformation non-trivial generalized kahler structure one pure spinor x. prove every poisson submanifold x generalized kahler submanifold respect deform generalized kahler structure provide non-trivial example generalized kahler submanifolds arise holomorphic poisson submanifolds also obtain unobstructed deformation bi-hermitian structure construct poisson structure
