 calabi flow riemann surface revisit new point view paper observe set functionals metric decrease calabi flow uniform low bound along flow give rise set integral estimate curvature flow use estimate together weak compactness obtain previous paper prove long term existence convergence calabi flow thus give new proof chruscial 's theorem set simple idea global integral estimate concentration compactness implication heat flow problem
