 remark limit case positive mass theorem manifold inner boundary herzlich prove new positive mass theorem riemannian -manifolds n g whose mean curvature boundary allow positivity paper study happen limit case theorem point boundary small positive eigenvalue dirac operator boundary strictly large one-half mean curvature case mass g must strictly positive prove mass bound positive constant c g g geq c g equality g c g hold outside compact set n g conformally flat scalar curvature vanishes constant c g uniquely determine metric g via dirac-harmonic spinor
