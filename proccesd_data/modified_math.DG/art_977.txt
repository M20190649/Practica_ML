 reducibility dupin submanifolds introduce notion weak reduciblity dupin submanifolds arbitrary codimension give complete characterization weakly reducible dupin submanifolds consequence general result broad class euclidean submanifolds main application derive explicit recursive procedure generate holonomic dupin submanifolds term solution completely integrable system linear partial differential equation first order obtain several additional result dupin submanifolds
