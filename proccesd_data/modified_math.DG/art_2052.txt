 homogeneous geodesic homogeneous finsler space paper study homogeneous geodesic homogeneous finsler space first give simple criterion characterize geodesic vector show geodesic lie group relative bi-invariant finsler metric cosets one-parameter subgroup existence infinitely many homogeneous geodesic compact semi-simple lie group establish introduce notion naturally reductive homogeneous finsler space special case study homogeneous geodesic homogeneous randers space finally study curvature property homogeneous geodesic particular prove s-curvature vanishes along homogeneous geodesic
