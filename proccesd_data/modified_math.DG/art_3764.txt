 partial ricci curvature foliation consider problem prescribe partial ricci curvature locally conformally flat manifold n g endow complementary orthogonal distribution provide condition symmetric -tensors simple form define admit metric tilde g conformal g solve partial ricci equation solution give explicitly use solution also give example problem prescribe mixed scalar curvature relate aim find optimally place distribution calculate variation total mixed scalar curvature partial ricci curvature play key role give example concern minimization total energy bending distribution
