 parabolic subgroup semisimple lie group einstein solvmanifolds paper study solvmanifolds construct parabolic subalgebras semisimple lie algebra solvmanifolds naturally homogeneous submanifolds symmetric space noncompact type show ricci curvature solvmanifolds coincide restriction ricci curvature ambient symmetric space consequently solvmanifolds einstein provide large number new example noncompact homogeneous einstein manifold also show solvmanifolds minimal totally geodesic submanifolds symmetric space
