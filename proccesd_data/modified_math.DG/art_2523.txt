 index constant mean curvature surface hyperbolic space show index constant mean curvature surface hyperbolic -space completely determine compact riemann surface secondary gauss map represent bryant 's weierstrass representation give three application observation firstly allow u explicitly compute index catenoid cousin example secondly allow u able apply method similar choe use kill vector field minimal surface euclidean -space case well result low bound index example thirdly allow u give direct proof result carmo silveira constant mean curvature surface hyperbolic -space finite total curvature finite index finally show constant mean curvature surface hyperbolic -space construct via correspondence minimal surface euclidean -space take advantage correspondence find low bound index
