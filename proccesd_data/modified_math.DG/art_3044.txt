 construction hamiltonian-minimal lagrangian submanifolds complex euclidean space describe several family lagrangian submanifolds complex euclidean space h-minimal i.e critical point volume functional restrict hamiltonian variation make use various construction involve planar spherical hyperbolic curve well legendrian submanifolds odd-dimensional unit sphere
