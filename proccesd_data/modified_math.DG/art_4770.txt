 nonnegatively curve homogeneous metric obtain scale fiber submersion consider invariant riemannian metric compact homogeneous space g h intermediate subgroup k g h exists homogeneous space g h total space riemannian submersion study question whether enlarge fiber submersion constant scaling factor retain nonnegative curvature case deformation start normal homogeneous metric classify triple group h k g nonnegative curvature maintain small deformation use criterion prove schwachh ofer tapp obtain complete classification case subgroup h full rank almost complete classification case regular subgroup
