 global decomposition lorentzian manifold generalized robertson-walker space generalize robertson-walker grw space constitute quite important family lorentzian geometry interesting question know whether lorentzian manifold decompose way well know existence suitable vector field guaranties local decomposition manifold paper give condition curvature ensure global decomposition apply several situation local decomposition appear naturally also study uniqueness question obtain de sitter space non trivial complete lorentzian manifold one grw decomposition moreover show friedmann cosmological model admit unique grw decomposition even locally
