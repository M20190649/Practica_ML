 biharmonic holomorphic map conformally kahler geometry give condition lee vector field almost hermitian manifold holomorphic map manifold -symplectic manifold must satisfy fourth-order condition biharmonic hence generalize lichnerowicz theorem harmonic map third-order non-linear condition show greatly simplify l.c.k manifold construction method example give dimension
