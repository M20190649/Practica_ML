 number constant mean curvature isometric immersion surface classical surface theory known example surface admit nontrivial isometric deformation few still non-simply-connected one consider isometric deformability question immersion x r orient non-simply-connected surface constant mean curvature h. prove space isometric immersion constant mean curvature h modulo congruence r either finite circle circle immersion x every cycle vanish force h also vanish torque work generalize rigidity result minimal surface constant mean curvature surface moreover identify close vector-valued -forms whose period give force torque
