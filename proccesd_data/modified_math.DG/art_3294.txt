 geometric interpretation two dimensional poisson kernel application hermann schwarz study complex analysis introduce geometric interpretation poisson kernel shall see geometric interpretation useful develop new approach old classical problem well obtain several new result mostly relate hyperbolic geometry example obtain one radius theorem say two radial eigenfunctions hyperbolic laplacian assume value origin assume common value within interval p length interval depend location eigenvalue complex plane depend distance
