 complex cr-structures compact lie group associate abelian action show samelson wang compact lie group k even dimension admit left-invariant complex structure k odd dimension admit left-invariant cr-structure maximal dimension prove recently charbonnel khalgui also give complete algebraic description structure article present alternative geometric construction type invariant structure compact lie group k semisimple prove left-invariant complex structure cr-structure maximal dimension transverse cr-action r induce holomorphic c l action quasi-projective manifold x naturally associate k. show x admits general abelian action also induce complex cr structure k generically non-invariant
