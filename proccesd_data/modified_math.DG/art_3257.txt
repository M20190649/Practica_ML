 nonnegatively curve fix point homogeneous manifold low dimension let g compact lie group act isometrically compact riemannian manifold nonempty fix point set g say fixed-point homogeneous g act transitively normal sphere component g fixed-point homogeneous manifold positive sectional curvature completely classify classify fixed-point homogeneous riemannian manifold dimension determine nonnegatively curve simply-connected -manifolds admit smooth fixed-point homogeneous circle action give orbit space structure
