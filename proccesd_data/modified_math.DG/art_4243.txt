 osp p q r -equivariant quantization investigate concept equivariant quantization superspace r p q r respect orthosymplectic algebra osp p q r method result vary upon superdimension p q- r. superdimension nonzero manage obtain result similar classical theorem duval lecomte ovsienko prove existence uniqueness equivariant quantization except resonant situation adapt method take account fact casimir operator orthosymplectic algebra supersymmetric tensor always diagonalizable superdimension negative even superdimension zero situation always resonant show existence one-parameter family equivariant quantization symbol degree two
