 space k hler metric ii paper second series deal function space smooth k ahler metric give close complex manifold fixed cohomology class previous result second author cite chen show space path length space geodesically convex sense two point join unique path always length minimize class c already confirm one donaldson 's conjecture completely verify another one partially present paper show first space expect path length space non-positive curvature sense a. d. alexanderov second result relate theory extremal k ahler metric namely gradient flow k energy strictly length decrease path except induce path holomorphic automorphisms result particular implies extremal k ahler metric unique holomorphic transformation provide donaldson 's conjecture regularity geodesic true
