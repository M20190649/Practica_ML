 integral structure h-type lie algebra paper prove every h-type lie algebra possess basis respect structure constant integer existence integral basis implies via mal'cev criterion simply connect h-type lie group contain cocompact lattice since campbell-hausdorff formula simple two-step nilpotent lie group actually avoid invoke mal'cev criterion exhibit lattice explicit way application calculate isoperimetric dimension h-type group
