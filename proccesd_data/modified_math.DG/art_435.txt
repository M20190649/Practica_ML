 jacobi field along harmonic -spheres bf c p integrable show jacobi field along harmonic map -sphere complex projective plane integrable i.e. tangent smooth variation harmonic map provide one known answer problem integrability raise different context geometry analysis imply jacobi field form tangent bundle component manifold harmonic map bf c p thus give nullity harmonic map also bearing behaviour weakly harmonic e -minimizing map -manifold bf c p near singularity structure singular set map manifold bf c p
