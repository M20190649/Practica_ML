 mean curvature flow submanifolds high codimension study mean curvature flow perspective partial differential equation begin gerhard huisken 's pioneering work since time mean curvature flow hypersurfaces lively area study although huisken 's seminal paper twenty-five year old study mean curvature flow submanifolds high codimension recently start receive attention mean curvature flow submanifolds main object investigation thesis indeed central result obtain consider high codimension analogue early hypersurface theorem result huisken 's paper roughly say convex hypersurfaces evolve mean curvature flow round point finite time obtain result ratio length second fundamental form length mean curvature vector bound explicit constant depend dimension codimension submanifold evolve mean curvature flow round point finite time investigate evolution flat curved background explore singular behaviour flow first singular time approach
