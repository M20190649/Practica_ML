 classification approach open manifold least uncountably many diffeomorphism type open manifold hence classification problem extremely difficult proceed follow define several uniform structure proper metric space consider arc component open complete manifold n g defines component hence classification amount two step first count component secondly count element inside component partially do invariant define bordism group relative characteristic number
