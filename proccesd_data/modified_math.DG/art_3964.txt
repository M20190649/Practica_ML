 ricci flow metric completion space kahler metric consider space kahler metric riemannian submanifold space riemannian metric study associated submanifold geometry particular show intrinsic extrinsic distance function equivalent also determine metric completion space kahler metric make contact recent generalization calabi-yau theorem due dinew guedj-zeriahi kolodziej application obtain new analytic stability criterion existence kahler-einstein metric fano manifold term ricci flow distance function also prove kahler-ricci flow converges soon converge metric sense
