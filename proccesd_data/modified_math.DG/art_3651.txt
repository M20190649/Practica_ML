 note hyperbolic flow sub-riemannian structure curvature reduced curvature basic differential invariant pair hamiltonian system lagrange distribution symplectic manifold show negativity reduced curvature imply hyperbolicity compact invariant set hamiltonian flow restrict prescribed energy level consider hamiltonian flow curve least action natural mechanical system sub-riemannian structure symmetry give sufficient condition reduced flow reduction first integral induce symmetry hyperbolic show new example anosov flow
