 integration holomorphic lie algebroids prove holomorphic lie algebroid integrable underlying real lie algebroid integrable thus integrability criterion crainic-fernandes also apply holomorphic context without modification consequence give another proof following theorem holomorphic poisson manifold integrable real imaginary part integrable real poisson manifold
