 diagonalization ricci flow lie group main purpose note prove basis nilpotent lie algebra diagonal left-invariant metric diagonal ricci tensor necessarily produce quite simple set structural constant namely bracket pair element basis must multiple bracket disjoint pair nonzero multiple element application ricci flow left-invariant metric lie group concern diagonalization also give
