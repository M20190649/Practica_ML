 immersion surface spin c -manifolds higgs field define higgs field four-dimensional spin c -manifold smooth section positive half-spinor bundle transverse zero section define positive functional factor intend generalization almost complex structure real four-manifolds may fact treat higgs field without zero specific spin c -structure notion totally real pseudoholomorphic immersion real surface almost complex manifold real dimension four straighforward generalization case spin c -manifold higgs field result consist first show totally real immersion closed orient surface four-dimensional spin c -manifolds higgs field basically property almost-complex case secondly provide description pseudoholomorphic immersion surface four-sphere endowed standard higgs field
