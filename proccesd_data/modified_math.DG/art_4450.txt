 hypersurfaces canonical principal direction give vector field x riemannian manifold hypersurface say canonical principal direction relative x projection x onto tangent space hypersurface give principal direction give different way build hypersurfaces well number useful characterization particular relate transnormal function eikonal equation condition constant mean curvature cmc obtain characterization canonical principal direction surface euclidean space delaunay surface also prove cmc constant angle hypersurfaces product mathbb r time n either totally geodesic cylinder
