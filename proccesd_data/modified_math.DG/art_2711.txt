 complete bound holomorphic curve immerse c arbitrary genus previous paper author construct complete holomorphic immersion unit disk c whose image bound paper shall prove existence complete holomorphic null immersion riemann surface arbitrary genus finite topology whose image bound c construct immersion apply method use f. j. lopez perturb genus zero example change genus analogue construction also give new method construct complete bound minimal immersion resp weakly complete maximal surface arbitrary genus finite topology euclidean -space resp lorentz-minkowski -spacetime
