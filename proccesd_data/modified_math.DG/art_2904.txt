 deformation hyperbolic convex polyhedron -cone-manifolds stoker problem first formulate consists understand extent convex polyhedron determine dihedral angle mean double construction problem intimately relate rigidity issue -dimensional cone-manifolds former paper two rigidity result proven imply infinitesimal version stoker conjecture true hyperbolic euclidean case second article prove local rigidity hold obtain space convex hyperbolic polyhedron give combinatorial type locally parameterized set dihedral angle together similar statement hyperbolic -cone-manifolds
