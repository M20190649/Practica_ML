 isometry group lorentzian manifold finite volume local geometry compact homogeneous lorentz space base work adam stuck well work zeghib classify lie group act isometrically locally effectively lorentzian manifold finite volume case corresponding lie algebra contain direct summand isomorphic two-dimensional special linear algebra twisted heisenberg algebra also describe geometric structure manifold compact use result investigate local geometry compact homogeneous lorentz space whose isometry group non-compact connect component turn reductive investigate isotropy representation curvature holonomy especially obtain ricci-flat compact homogeneous lorentz space flat compact isometry group
