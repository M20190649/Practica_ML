 surface three dimensional contact manifold paper introduce two notion surface contact manifold first one call degree transversality dot measure transversality tangent space surface contact plane second quantity call curvature transversality cot design give comparison principle dot along characteristic curve bound cot particular give estimate length characteristic curve assume cot bound positive constant show surface constant cot exist classify graph heisenberg group vanish cot accomplish show equation graph zero cot decompose two first order pdes one backward invisicid burger equation finally show p-minimal graph equation heisenberg group also decomposition moreover use decomposition write explicit formula solution near regular point
