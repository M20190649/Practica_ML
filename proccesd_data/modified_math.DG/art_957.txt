 isoparametric hypersurfaces four principal curvature let isoparametric hypersurface sphere n four distinct principal curvature u nzner show four principal curvature two distinct multiplicity stolz show pair must either equal multiplicity isoparametric hypersurface fkm-type construct ferus karcher u nzner orthogonal representation clifford algebra paper prove multiplicity satisfy geq isoparametric hypersurface must fkm-type together known result takagi case ozeki takeuchi handle possible pair multiplicity except case classification problem remain open paper improve result pre-existing preprint title case remain open
