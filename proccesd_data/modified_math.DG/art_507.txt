 unification gravitational electromagnetic field paper present theory unify gravitation theory mechanical effect different riemannian theory like gtr moreover build style electomagnetic field theory paper continuation complex variant theory yield required unification gravitation electromagnetism gravitational field describe scalar potential mu take complex value mu obtain unification theory example electric field appear imaginary -vector field acceleration magnetic field appear imaginary -vector angular velocity imaginary part complex mass electric charge particle
