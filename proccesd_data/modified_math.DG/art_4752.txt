 deformation constant mean curvature surface h xr vertical end infinity study constant mean curvature surface h xr admit compactification mean curvature operator show particular family complete entire graph h admits structure infinite dimensional manifold local control behavior infinity graph also appear half-space property deduce uniqueness result infinity deform non degenerate constant mean curvature annulus provide large class non rotational example construct possibly embed annulus without axis i.e two vertical asymptotically rotational non align end
