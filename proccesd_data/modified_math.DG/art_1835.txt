 recover lagrangian use homogeneous variational bicomplex show homogeneous variational bicomplex provide useful formalism describe number property single-integral variational problem introduce subsequence one row bicomplex locally exact respect variational derivative therefore able recover lagrangian set equation give variationally-closed differential form example show recover first-order lagrangian suitable set second-order equation
