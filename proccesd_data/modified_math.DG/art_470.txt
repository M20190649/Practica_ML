 surface prescribed shape operator problem immerse simply connected surface prescribed shape operator discuss classical recent work know aside special degenerate case shape operator realize surface one family principal curve geodesic space realization convex set affine space dimension case maximum dimension realizability achieve classify know two family shape operator one depend essentially three arbitrary function one variable call type article another depend essentially two arbitrary function one variable call type ii article article classification result rederived emphasis explicit computability space solution show operator either type realization immersion compute quadrature moreover explicit normal form compute quadrature together case type solve single linear second order ode one variable even last step avoid type case space realization discuss case along remarkable geometric property several explicit example construct mostly already literature use illustrate various feature problem
