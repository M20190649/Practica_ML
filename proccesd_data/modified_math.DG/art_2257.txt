 pseudo focal point along lorentzian geodesic morse index give lorentzian manifold g geodesic gamma timelike jacobi field mathcal along gamma introduce special class instant along gamma call mathcal -pseudo conjugate focal relatively initial orthogonal submanifold prove mathcal -pseudo conjugate instant form finite set number equal morse index suitable restriction index form give riemannian-like morse index theorem special case theory consider geodesic stationary static lorentzian manifold jacobi field mathcal obtain restriction globally define timelike kill vector field
