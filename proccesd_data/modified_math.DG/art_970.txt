 singular semi-flat calabi-yau metric affine flat manifold coordinate x j convex local potential function f call affine kahler metric f ij dx dx j semi-flat calabi-yau satisfy det f ij recently gross-wilson construct many metric minus singularity degenerate limit calabi-yau metric elliptic k surface construct many metric singular point compute local affine structure near singularity technique involve affine differential geometry solve semilinear pde minus singularity also compute action mirror symmetry resulting surface
