 rigidity amalgamated product negative curvature let gamma fundamental group compact n-dimensional riemannian manifold x sectional curvature bound suppose gamma free product subgroup b amalgamated subgroup c. prove critical exponent delta c c satisfies delta c geq n- equality happen exist embedded compact hypersurface x totally geodesic constant sectional curvature fundamental group c separate x two connected component whose fundamental group b. similar result hold gamma hnn extension generally gamma act simplicial tree without fix point
