 spherical rank rigidity blaschke manifold let complete riemannian manifold whose sectional curvature bound say positive spherical rank along every geodesic one hit conjugate point pi following theorem prove complete simply connected riemannian manifold upper curvature bound positive spherical rank isometric compact rank one symmetric space cross i.e. isometric sphere complex projective space quaternionic projective space cayley plane notion spherical rank analogous notion euclidean rank hyperbolic rank study several people see reference main theorem prove two step first show called blaschke manifold extremal injectivity radius equal diameter prove isometric cross
