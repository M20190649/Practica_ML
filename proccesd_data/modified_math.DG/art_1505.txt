 existence infinitely many close geodesic orbifolds revolution use theory geodesic surface revolution introduce period function use main tool show two-dimensional orbifold revolution homeomorphic must contain infinite number geometrically distinct close geodesic since orbifold revolution regard topological two-sphere metric singularity extend bangert 's theorem existence infinitely many close geodesic smooth riemannian two-sphere addition give example two-sphere cone-manifold revolution possess single closed geodesic thus show bangert 's result hold wider class closed surface cone manifold structure
