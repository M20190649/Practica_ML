 geometry closed g -structure give answer question pose recently r.bryant namely show compact -dimensional manifold equip g -structure closed fundamental form einstein riemannian holonomy induced metric contain g could consider g analogue goldberg conjecture almost kahler geometry result generalize r.l.bryant close g -structures tightly pinch ricci tensor extend another direction prove compact g -manifold closed fundamental form divergence-free weyl tensor g -manifold parallel fundamental form introduce second symmetric ricci-type tensor show einstein condition apply two ricci tensor closed g -structure imply induced metric holonomy group contain g
