 berger type normal holonomy theorem complex submanifolds prove berger type theorem normal holonomy group i.e. holonomy group normal connection full complete complex submanifold complex projective space namely normal holonomy act transitively submanifold complex orbit complex projective space isotropy representation irreducible hermitian symmetric space rank great equal moreover show complete irreducible complex submanifolds complex euclidean space normal holonomy generic i.e. act transitively unit sphere normal space method proof rely heavily singular data appropriate holonomy tube lift submanifold complex euclidean space projective case basic fact complex submanifolds
