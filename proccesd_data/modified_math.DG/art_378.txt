 holomorphic vector field minimal lagrangian submanifolds purpose note establish following theorem let n kahler manifold l compact orient immersed minimal lagrangian submanifold n v holomorphic vector field neighbourhood l n. let div v complex divergence v. integral div v l vice versa let n n kahler-einstein non-zero scalar curvature l n totally real orient embed n-dimensional real-analytic submanifold n s.t divergence holomorphic vector field define neighbourhood l n integrates l. l minimal lagrangian submanifold n
