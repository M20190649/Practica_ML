 spinorial characterization surface -dimensional pseudo-riemannian space form give spinorial characterization isometrically immersed surface arbitrary signature -dimensional pseudo-riemannian space form lorentzian surface generalize recent work first author mathbb r lorentzian space form also characterize immersion riemannian surface space deduce analogous result timelike immersion lorentzian surface space form corresponding signature well spacelike timelike immersion surface signature hence achieve complete spinorial description class pseudo-riemannian immersion
