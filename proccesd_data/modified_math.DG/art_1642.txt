 complete manifold nonnegative curvature operator short note simple application strong result prove recently b ohm wilking give classification closed manifold -nonnegative curvature operator moreover new invariant cone construction b ohm wilking show complete riemannian manifold dimension ge whose curvature operator bound satisfy pinch condition r ge delta r delta must compact provide intrinsic analogue result hamilton convex hypersurfaces
