 riemannian geometric realization ricci tensor generalized algebraic curvature operator examine question geometric realizability algebraic structure arise naturally affine riemannian geometry suppose give algebraic curvature operator r point p manifold suppose give real analytic resp c-k finite k least pseudo-riemannian metric define near p. construct torsion free real analytic resp c-k connection define near p tangent bundle whose curvature operator give operator r p constant scalar curvature show r ricci symmetric choose ricci symmetric r trace free ricci tensor choose trace free ricci tensor r ricci alternate choose ricci alternating
