 weak curvature condition functional inequality give sufficient condition measured length space x admit local global poincare inequality first introduce condition dm x define term transport measure show dm along double condition imply scale-invariant local poincare inequality show x nonnegative n-ricci curvature unique minimize geodesic almost pair point satisfy dm constant n. condition dm preserve measure gromov-hausdorff limit prove sobolev inequality measured length space n-ricci curvature bound k finally prove sharp global inequality
