 universal curvature identity ii show universal curvature identity hold riemannian setting extend naturally pseudo-riemannian setting thus euh-park-sekigawa identity also hold pseudo-riemannian manifold study euler-lagrange equation associate chern-gauss-bonnet formula show riemannian setting give solely term curvature term covariant derivative curvature even pseudo-riemannian setting
