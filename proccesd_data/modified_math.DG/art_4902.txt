 asymptotic expansion complete ricci-flat kahler metric quasi-projective manifold work describe asymptotic behavior complete metric prescribed ricci curvature open kahler manifold compactified addition smooth ample divisor first construct explicit sequence kahler metric special approximate property use metric start point able work asymptotic behavior solution give work tian-yau particular obtain full asymptotic expansion
