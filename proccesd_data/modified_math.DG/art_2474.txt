 cross curvature flow locally homogeneous three-manifolds ii paper study positive cross curvature flow locally homogeneous -manifolds describe long time behavior flow combine early result concern asymptotic behavior negative cross curvature flow describe two side behavior maximal solution cross curvature flow locally homogeneous -manifolds show typically positive cross curvature flow locally homogeneous -manifold produce heisenberg type sub-riemannian geometry
