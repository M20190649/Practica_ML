 frankel conjecture sasaki geometry classify simply connect compact sasaki manifold dimension n positive transverse bisectional curvature particular k ahler cone correspond manifold must bi-holomorphic c n backslash application recover mori-siu-yau theorem frankel conjecture extend certain orbifold version main idea deform sasaki manifold standard round sphere two step fix complex structure k ahler cone first deform metric along sasaki-ricci flow obtain limit sasaki-ricci soliton positive transverse bisectional curvature vary reeb vector field along negative gradient volume functional deform sasaki-ricci soliton sasaki-einstein metric positive transverse bisectional curvature i.e round sphere second deformation possible one treat simultaneously regular irregular sasaki manifold even manifold one start regular quasi-regular i.e k ahler manifold orbifolds
