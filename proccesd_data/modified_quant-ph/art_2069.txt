 robustness decoherence-free subspace quantum computation show recently d.a lidar et al. phys rev lett within framework semigroup markovian master equation decoherence-free df subspace exist stable first order time perturbation result extend non-markovian regime generalize particular show within semigroup non-markovian operator sum representation df subspace stable order time symmetry-breaking perturbation df subspace thus ideal quantum memory application quantum computation however stability result extend beyond first order thus perform robust quantum computation df subspace must supplement quantum error correct code
