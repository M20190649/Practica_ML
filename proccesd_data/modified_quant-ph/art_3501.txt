 arbitrary phase quantum amplitude amplification consider use arbitrary phase quantum amplitude amplification generalization quantum searching prove phase condition amplitude amplification give tan varphi tan phi phi phi phase use success probability give algorithm thus choice phase depend nontrivially nonlinearly success probability utilize condition give method construct quantum algorithm succeed certainty implement arbitrary rotation also conclude phase error order frac sqrt tolerate amplitude amplification
