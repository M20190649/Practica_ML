 phase match quantum search iteration grover 's original quantum search algorithm contain step two hadamard-walsh transformation two amplitude inversion inversion marked state replace arbitrary phase rotation theta inversion prepared state gamma replace rotation phi find phase rotation must satisfy matching condition theta phi approximate formula amplitude marked state arbitrary number iteration also derive give also simple explanation phase matching requirement
