 bell inequality bell state maximally entangled state n qubits first present bell type inequality n qubits assume n qubits independent quantum mechanic violate inequality ratio increase exponentially m. hence experiment n qubits violate inequality set low bound number entangled qubits next propose definition maximally entangled state n qubits purpose study different criterion four criterion find compatible number n qubits determine orthogonal basis consisting maximally entangle state generalize bell state
