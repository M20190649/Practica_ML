 quantum count study extension grover 's quantum search algorithm first generalize grover iteration light concept call amplitude amplification show quadratic speedup obtain quantum search algorithm classical brute force still obtain large family search problem good classical heuristic exist finally main result combine idea grover 's shor 's quantum algorithm perform approximate counting see amplitude estimation process
