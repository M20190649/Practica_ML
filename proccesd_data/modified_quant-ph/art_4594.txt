 security quantum key distribution use d-level system consider two quantum cryptographic scheme rely encode key qudits i.e quantum state d-dimensional hilbert space first cryptosystem use two mutually unbiased base thereby extend bb scheme second exploit available base extend six-state protocol qubits derive information gain potential eavesdropper apply cloning-based individual attack along upper bound error rate ensure unconditional security coherent attack
