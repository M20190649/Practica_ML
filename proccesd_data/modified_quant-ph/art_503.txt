 atomic quantum zeno effect ensemble single system so-called quantum zeno effect essentially consequence projection postulate ideal measurement test effect itano et al perform experiment ensemble atom rapidly repeat level measurement realize mean short laser pulse use dynamical consideration give explanation projection postulate apply good approximation measurement correction ideal measurement determine explicitly use discuss far experiment itano et al consider test quantum zeno effect also analyze new possible experiment single atom stochastic light dark period interpret manifestation quantum zeno effect show measurement point view give quick intuitive understanding experiment type although finer analysis take correction account
