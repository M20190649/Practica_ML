 high-efficiency quantum interrogation measurement via quantum zeno effect phenomenon quantum interrogation allow one optically detect presence absorb object without measuring light interact application quantum zeno effect object inhibit otherwise coherent evolution light probability interrogating photon absorb principle arbitrarily small implement technique demonstrate efficiency exceed theoretical-maximum original interaction-free '' measurement proposal also predict experimentally verify previously unsuspected dependence loss efficiency observe feasibility efficiency demonstrate
