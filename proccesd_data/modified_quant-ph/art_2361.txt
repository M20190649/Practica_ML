 teleportation continuous variable measurement procedure use quantum teleportation analyze viewpoint general theory quantum-mechanical measurement show find teleported state one know identity resolution positive operator-valued measure generate corresponding instrument quantum operation describe system state change cause measurement rather instrument quantum teleportation protocol base measurement associate non-orthogonal identity resolution propose system non-degenerate continuous spectrum
