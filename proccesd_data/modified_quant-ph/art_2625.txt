 pointer state via decoherence quantum measurement consider interaction quantum system spin- macroscopic quantum apparatus harmonic oscillator turn couple bath harmonic oscillator exact solution markovian master equation show reduced density matrix system-apparatus combine decoheres statistical mixture spin eventually correlate pointer state apparatus zero temperature bath pointer state turn coherent state harmonic oscillator arbitrary initial state apparatus high temperature bath pointer state gaussian distribution generalize coherent state case off-diagonal element spin-space decohere time scale go inversely square separation pointer exact result also demonstrate unambiguous way pointer state measurement model emerge independent initial state apparatus
