 quantum recognition eigenvalue structure device thermodynamic property quantum algorithms speed classical counterpart propose problem recognition eigenvalue fixed precision give quantum circuit generate unitary mapping u complex number problem determine eigenvalue u give molecular structure find thermodynamic function like partition function entropy etc gas consist molecule recognition molecular structure find molecular structure give spectrum recognition electronic device give electronic device use black box recognize internal construction consider mainly structure generate sparse spectrum algorithms require time square root logarithm time classical analog first three problem give exponential memory saving say time require distinguish two device give spectrum seventh root time direct classical method recognition eigenvalue sixth root thus microscopic quantum device recognize molecular structure physical property environment faster big classical computer
