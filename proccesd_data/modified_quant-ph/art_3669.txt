 note reversibility quantum jump recently prove quantum jump may reverse unitary process provide initial state restrict condition application process prevent decoherence example quantum computer suggest shall show situation quantum jump reversible supply information initial state additional information know beforehand therefore reversibility type contradict general statement quantum measurement theory measurement reverse consequence coherence state say quantum computer restore destroy dissipative process character measurement
