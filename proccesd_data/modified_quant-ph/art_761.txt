 complementary group technique resolution outer multiplicity problem su n ii recoupling approach solution su supset u reduce wigner coefficient general procedure derivation su supset u reduce wigner coefficient coupling lambda mu time lambda mu downarrow lambda mu eta eta out multiplicity label need decomposition propose base recoupling approach accord complementary group technique give prove non-multiplicity-free reduced wigner coefficient su n unique respect canonical outer multiplicity label transform one set out multiplicity label another transformation matrix element number occurrence corresponding irrep lambda mu decomposition lambda mu time lambda mu downarrow lambda mu thus kind reduced wigner coefficient multiplicity obtain special transformation new feature kind reduced wigner coefficient difference reduced wigner coefficient choice multiplicity label give previously discuss method also apply derivation general su n wigner reduced wigner coefficient multiplicity algebraic expression another kind reduced wigner coefficient so-called reduced auxiliary wigner coefficient su supset u also obtain
