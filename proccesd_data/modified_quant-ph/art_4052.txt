 classical programmability enough quantum circuit universality approximate sense show m.a nielsen i.l chuang impossible build strictly universal programmable quantum gate array could perform unitary operation precisely suggest use probabilistic gate array instead present work show use physical weak condition universality suggest already early work d.deutsch talk simulation arbitrary finite precision possible build universal programmable gate array no-go theorem nielsen chuang new interesting consequence -- controlling program gate array consider pure classical detailed design deterministic quantum gate array universal approximate sense '' consider paper
