 entanglement purification via separable superoperators one fundamental concept quantum information theory entanglement purification transformation partially entangled state smaller-dimensional completely entangled state particular interest protocols entanglement purification epps alternate purely local operation one- two-way classical communication present work consider general simpler class transformation call separable superoperators since every epp separable superoperator bound separable superoperators apply well epps use fact give new upper bound rate epps bell-diagonal state thus capacity bell-diagonal channel
