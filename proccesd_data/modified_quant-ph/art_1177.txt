 fault-tolerant quantum computation discovery quantum error correction greatly improve long-term prospect quantum compute technology encode quantum information protect error arise due uncontrolled interaction environment due imperfect implementation quantum logical operation recovery error work effectively even occasional mistake occur recovery procedure furthermore encode quantum information process without serious propagation error principle arbitrarily long quantum computation perform reliably provide average probability error per gate less certain critical value accuracy threshold may possible incorporate intrinsic fault tolerance design quantum compute hardware perhaps invoke topological aharonov-bohm interaction process quantum information
