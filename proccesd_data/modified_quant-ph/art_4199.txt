 quantum compute globally control exchange-type interaction interaction qubits quantum computer non-diagonal form e.g heisenberg interaction one must able switch order prevent uncontrolled propagation state therefore qc scheme typically demand local control interaction strength pair neighbor qubits demonstrate degree control necessary suffice switch interaction collectively something principle achieve global field rather local manipulation observation may offer significant simplification various solid state optical lattice nmr implementation
