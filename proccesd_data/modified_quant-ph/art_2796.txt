 rate optimal purification procedure purification process decoherence partially reverse use several input system subject noise purity output generally increase number input system decrease number required output system construct optimal quantum operation task discuss asymptotic behaviour number input go infinity rate output system may generate depend crucially type purity requirement one test purity output system one time rate infinite fidelity may make approach time number output go infinity arbitrarily fast hand one also require correlation output decrease rate zero fidelity pure product state go number output per input go zero however fidelity close require optimal purifier achieve positive rate compute
