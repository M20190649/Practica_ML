 decoherence-free subspace multiple-qubit error characterization coherence open quantum system degrade interaction bath decoherence avoid restrict dynamic system special decoherence-free subspace subspace usually construct assumption spatially symmetric system-bath coupling show decoherence-free subspace may appear without spatial symmetry instead consider model system-bath interaction first order multiple-qubit coupling bath present single-qubit system-bath coupling absent derive necessary sufficient condition appearance decoherence-free state model give number example sequel paper show perform universal fault tolerant quantum computation decoherence-free subspace consider paper
