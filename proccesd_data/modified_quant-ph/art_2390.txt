 universal fault-tolerant quantum compute novel universal fault-tolerant basis set gate quantum computation describe set necessary perform quantum computation realistic noisy environment new basis consist two single-qubit gate hadamard sigma z one double-qubit gate controlled-not since set consisting controlled-not hadamard gate universal new basis achieves universality include one additional elementary sense include angle irrational multiple pi single-qubit gate hence potentially simple universal basis one construct also provide alternative proof universality know class universal fault-tolerant basis propose shor kitaev
