 minimal entropy state emerge noisy quantum channel paper consider minimal entropy qubit state transmit two us noisy quantum channel model action completely positive trace-preserving stochastic map provide strong support conjecture minimal entropy additive namely minimum entropy achieve product state transmit explicitly prove tensor product two unital stochastic map qubit state use entanglement involve state emerge minimal entropy decrease entropy minimum achievable use product state give separate argument base geometry image set density matrix stochastic map suggest minimal entropy conjecture hold non-unital well unital map also show maximal norm output state multiplicative product map n -qubit state include least one map unital class unital channel bf c show additivity minimal entropy implies holevo capacity channel additive two input achievable orthogonal state equal shannon capacity imply superadditivity capacity possible non-unital channel
