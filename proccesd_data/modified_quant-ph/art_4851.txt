 entanglement factorization-approximation bi-partite quantum system define finite dimensional hilbert space investigate sense entanglement change interaction imply purpose introduce entanglement operator show represent non-conserved property bi-partite system type interaction general relation exclude existence special initial product state entanglement remain small period time despite interaction case derive approximation full schroedinger equation allow treatment composite system term product state induced error estimate factorization-approximation one subsystem appear effective potential pertinent example jaynes-cummings model reduce semi-classical rotating wave approximation
