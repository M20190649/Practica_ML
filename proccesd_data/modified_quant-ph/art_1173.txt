 quantum classical description measuring apparatus measuring apparatus describe quantum mechanic interact quantum system observation must give classical description result measurement appear objective reality alternatively apparatus may always treat quantum mechanic measure second apparatus dual description article examine whether two different description mutually consistent show dynamical variable use first apparatus represent operator weyl-wigner type example linear coordinate conversion quantum classical terminology affect final result however first apparatus encode measurement different type operator e.g. phase operator two method calculation may give different result
