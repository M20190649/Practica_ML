 characterize mixing measurement quantum mechanic fundamental constraint characterize relationship mixture rho sum p rho quantum state state rho mixed probability p fundamental constraint characterize relationship prior posterior state quantum measurement paper show many surprisingly strong constraint mixing measurement process express simply term eigenvalue quantum state involve constraint capture succinct fashion mean say quantum measurement acquire information system measure considerably simplify proof many result entanglement transformation
