 computation quantum characteristic exponent quantum characteristic exponent may define operational meaning classical lyapunov exponent latter express functional density existence condition support measure property discuss well problem encounter numerical computation quantum exponent although example true quantum chaos may exhibit tame effect quantum mechanic chaos quite apparent computation quantum exponent however even exponent vanish functionals use definition may still provide characterization distinct complexity class quantum behavior
