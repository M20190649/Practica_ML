 correlated error quantum error correction show error generate correlatedly provide quantum bit directly interact couple generally no-qubits-interaction condition assume except case two-qubit gate operation perform particular no-qubits-interaction condition satisfy collective decoherence model thus error correlate collective decoherence consequently say current quantum error correct code correct single-qubit-errors work case include collective decoherence
