 conditional generation error syndrome fault-tolerant error correction paper show fault -- tolerant error correction scheme recently propose divincenzo shor may improve scheme unlike early one also deal single error might occur em gate operation require implementation error correction -- gate hence present improvement towards enable error correction practical possibility involved quantum computation e.g factorization large number
