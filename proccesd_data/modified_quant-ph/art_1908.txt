 quantum teleportation squeezed vacuum state show partial entanglement inherent two mode squeeze vacuum state admits two different teleportation protocol two protocol refer different kind joint measurement may make sender one protocol recently implement quadrature phase approach braunstein kimble phys rev lett bf base recognise two mode squeeze vacuum state also entangle respect photon number difference phase sum show protocol also realise teleportation however limitation arise due fact photon number spectrum bound zero example show give entanglement resource may admit single teleportation protocol question arise optimum protocol general case
