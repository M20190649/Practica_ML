 implement quantum random walk recently several group investigate quantum analogue random walk algorithm line circle find quantum version markedly different feature classical version namely variance line mixing time circle increase quadratically faster quantum version compare classical version propose scheme implement quantum random walk line circle ion trap quantum computer current ion trap technology number step could experimentally implement relatively small however show enhanced feature walk could observe experimentally limit strong decoherence quantum random walk tend classical random walk measure degree walk remain quantum algorithm could serve important benchmarking protocol ion trap quantum computer
