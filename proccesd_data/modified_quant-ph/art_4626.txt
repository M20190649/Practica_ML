 heating decoherence suppression use decouple technique study application decouple technique case damped vibrational mode chain trapped ion use quantum bus linear ion trap quantum computer show vibrational heating could efficiently suppress use appropriate parity kick '' also show vibrational decoherence suppress decoupling procedure even though generally difficult rate parity kick apply increase effective bath temperature
