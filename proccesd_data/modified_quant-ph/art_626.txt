 homodyning universal detection homodyne tomography i. e. homodyning scan local oscillator phase well assess method measure '' quantum state paper show use kind universal detection measure generic field operator however expense additional noise general class field operator measure way present include also operator inaccessible heterodyne detection noise tomographical homodyning compare heterodyning operator measure way turn operator homodyning good heterodyne mean photon number sufficiently small finally robustness method additive phase-insensitive noise analyze show half photon thermal noise would spoil measurement completely
