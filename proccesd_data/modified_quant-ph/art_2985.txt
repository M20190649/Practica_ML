 complete separability fourier representation n-qubit state necessary condition separability easily express computational basis sufficient condition conveniently express spin basis use hadamard matrix define relationship two base emphasize interpretation fourier transform prove general sufficient condition complete separability term spin coefficient give necessary sufficient condition complete separability class generalized werner density application theory give necessary sufficient condition full separability particular set n -qubit state whose density satisfy peres condition
