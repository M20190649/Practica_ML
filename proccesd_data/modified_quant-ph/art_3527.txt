 observables describe quantum reference frame reference frame f describe element g poincare group p connect f give fix frame f f quantum frame define physical object follow law quantum physic parameter g consider quantum observables however observables compatible namely coordinate origin f represent self-adjoint operator difficulty overcome consider positive-operator-valued measure povm p covariant respect left translation group namely covariance system develop construction procedure kind mathematical structure formalism also use discuss quantum observables measure respect quantum reference frame
