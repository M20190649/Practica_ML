 effect time delay adaptive phase measurement possible make measurement phase optical mode use linear optic without introduce extra phase uncertainty extra phase variance quite large heterodyne measurement however possible reduce theoretical limit log n n use adaptive measurement measurement quite sensitive experimental inaccuracy especially time delay inefficient detector show minimum introduce phase variance time delay tau tau n result verify numerically show phase variance introduce approach limit adaptive scheme use best final phase estimate main exception adaptive mark ii scheme simplified feedback extremely sensitive time delay extra phase variance due time delay consider mark case simplify feedback verify tau result obtain wiseman killip rigorous analytic technique numerically
