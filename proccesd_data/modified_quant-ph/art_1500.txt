 entangle mixed state local purification linden massar popescu recently give optimization argument show single two-qubit werner state mixture maximally entangle bell state purify local operation classical communication generalise result give simple explanation particular show purification scheme use local operation classical communication produce pure singlet mixed state two spin- particle generally scheme produce maximally entangled state pair finite-dimensional system generic mixed state also show werner state belong large class state whose fidelity increase scheme
