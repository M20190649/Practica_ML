 decoherence ion trap due laser intensity phase fluctuation consider one source decoherence single trap ion due intensity phase fluctuation excite laser pulse simplicity assume stochastic process involve white noise process enable u give simple master equation description source decoherence master equation average noise sufficient describe result experiment probe oscillation electronic population energy exchange internal electronic motion result good qualitative agreement recent experiment predict decoherence rate depend vibrational quantum number different way depend vibrational excitation sideband use
