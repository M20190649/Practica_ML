 dense antihydrogen production storage envision antimatter propulsion discuss possibility dense antihydrogen could provide path towards mechanism deep space propulsion system concentrate first example bose-einstein condensate bec antihydrogen bose-einstein condensate matter antimatter coherent state analogous photon laser beam individual atom lose independent identity allow many atom store small volume context recent advance produce control becs well make antihydrogen could potentially provide revolutionary path towards efficient storage large quantity antimatter perhaps eventually cluster solid
