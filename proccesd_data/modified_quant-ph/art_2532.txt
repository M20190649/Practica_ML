 two-level atom optical parametric oscillator spectrum transmitted fluorescent field weak driving field limit consider interaction two-level atom inside optical parametric oscillator weak driving field limit essentially atom-cavity system drive occasional pair correlated photon weakly squeeze light find may hole dip spectrum fluorescent transmit light occur even strong-coupling limit find hole vacuum-rabi doublet also spectra sub-natural linewidth may occur effect disappear large driving field unlike spectral narrowing obtain resonance fluorescence squeezed vacuum important squeezing parameter n tend zero system interact one correlate pair photon time show previous explanation spectral narrowing spectral hole incoherent scattering applicable present case propose new explanation attribute anomalous effect quantum interference two-photon scattering system
