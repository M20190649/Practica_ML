 limit control quantum system kinematical bound optimization observables question dynamical realizability paper investigate limit control mixed-state quantum system constraint unitary evolution non-dissipative quantum system impose kinematical bound optimization arbitrary observables summarize previous result kinematical bound show bound dynamically realizable completely controllable system moreover establish improve bound certain partially controllable system finally question dynamical realizability bound arbitary partially controllable system show depend accessible set associate control system unitary group u n result control computation discuss briefly
