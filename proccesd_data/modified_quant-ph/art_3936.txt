 potential multipartide entanglement measure discuss entanglement multiparticle quantum system propose potential measure type entanglement pure state n qubits n-tangle system two qubits n-tangle equal square concurrence system three qubits equal `` residual entanglement '' show n -tangle also equal generalization concurrence square even n use fact prove n-tangle entanglement monotone however n-tangle undefined odd n finally propose measure relate n-tangle mixed state system n qubits find analytical formula measure even n
