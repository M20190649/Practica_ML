 quantum code minimum distance two reasonable expect theory quantum code simplify case code minimum distance thus make sense examine code hope techniques prove effective generalize mind present number result code minimum distance first compute linear programming bound dimension code show bound attain code either even length length next consider question uniqueness show optimal code length unique imply well-known one-qubit-in-five single-error correcting code unique present nonadditive optimal code great even length finally compute full automorphism group important distance code allow u determine full automorphism group gf -linear code
