 photon-photon correlation entanglement doped photonic crystal consider photonic crystal pc dope four-level atom whose intermediate transition couple near-resonantly photonic band-gap edge show two photon couple different atomic transition atom manifest strong phase amplitude correlation one photon induce large phase shift photon trigger absorption thus operate ultrasensitive nonlinear photon-switch feature allow creation entangled two-photon state unique advantage previously consider medium control laser need ii system parameter choose cause full two-photon entanglement via absorption iii number pc combine network
