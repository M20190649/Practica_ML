 quantum reference system reconcile locality quantum mechanic status locality quantum mechanic analyze nonstandard point view assume quantum state relative depend define respect big physical system contain former system subsystem hence big system act reference system show quantum mechanic reformulate accordance new physical assumption important consequence dependence state may comparable i.e. check suitable measurement simultaneously special circumstance fully reflect mathematically theory especially show certain joint probability corresponding combined event play vital role proof bell 's theorem exist conclusion principle locality fully valid quantum mechanic one give instead locality intuitively natural-looking feature realism namely comparability exist state
