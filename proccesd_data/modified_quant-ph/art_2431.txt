 quantum teleportation epr pair three-particle entanglement teleportation epr pair use triplet state horne-greenberger-zeilinger form two receiver consider need three-particle basis joint measurement contrast one qubit teleportation required basis maximally entangle consist state correspond maximally entanglement two particle use outcome measurement receiver recover unknown epr state however one separately teleportation n-particle entanglement discuss
