 new strategy suppress decoherence quantum computation controlable strong interaction qubit 's bath external system i.e bath 's environment allow choose condition decoherence qubit 's state substantially decrease certain limit completely avoid substantially decrease mean correlation involve bath 's state prove negligible correlation qubit 's environment 's state make ineffective comparatively long time interval effectively one may choose condition sufficiently long time interval initial state qubit bath remain unchanged thus remove kind error method successfully employ simplified model solid-state-nuclear quantum computer propose kane
