 remark concern entropy-like quantity q especially quantum system particle picture model pure point spectrum quantum mechanical system entropy-like quantity q define q differ usually define entropy q may increase time isolated system essential condition difference q assumption set bf observables represent measurement proper subset set selfadjoint operator underlying idea make visible case particle system non-trivial scattering model-character reason come fact continuous spectrum replace point-spectra seem evident direct connection exist q sinai-kolmogorov-entropy least model pure point-spectra
