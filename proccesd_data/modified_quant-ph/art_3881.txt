 quantum magic bullet via entanglement two particle entangle respect continuous variable position momentum exhibit variety nonclassical feature first measurement one particle project particle state complex conjugate state first particle i.e. measurement one particle project particle time-reversed state second continuous-variable entanglement use implement quantum magic bullet one particle manage pass scattering potential matter low probability event second particle also pass related scatter potential probability one phenomenon investigate term original epr state experimental realization suggest term entangled photon state
