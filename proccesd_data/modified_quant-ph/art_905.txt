 generalize coherent state unique bell state quantum system lie group symmetries consider quantum system whose dynamical symmetry group semisimple lie group split decay two subsystem symmetry prove state system factorize upon split generalized coherent state since bell 's inequality never violate direct product state system prepare generalized coherent state split quantum correlation create therefore generalized coherent state unique bell state i.e. pure quantum state preserve fundamental classical property satisfy bell 's inequality upon splitting
