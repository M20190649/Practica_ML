 quantum state diffusion measurement second quantization realistic dynamical theory measurement base diffusion quantum state nonunitary whereas quantum field theory generalization unitary problem quantum field theory quantum state diffusion qsd appear already lagrangian formulation qsd classical equation motion liouville 's theorem apply usual field theory formulation problem resolve double number freedom use represent quantum field space quantum field classical configuration space volume need conserve instead usual phase space liouville 's theorem applies creation operator quantized field satisfy qsd equation annihilation operator satisfy conjugate eqation appear formal role
