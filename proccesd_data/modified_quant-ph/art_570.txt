 error correction symmetrization quantum computer error quantum computer two kind sudden perturbation isolated qubits slow random drift qubits latter may reduce eliminate mean symmetrization namely use many replica computer force joint quantum state completely symmetric hand isolated error correct quantum codewords represent logical qubit redundant way several physical qubits one physical qubits perturb example get entangle unknown environment still enough information encode physical qubits restore logical qubit disentangle environment recovery procedure may consist unitary operation without need actually identify error
