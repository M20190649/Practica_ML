 spatially correlate qubit error burst-correcting quantum cod explore design quantum error-correcting code case decoherence event qubits correlate particular consider case spatially contiguous qubits decohere analogous case burst error classical coding theory present several different efficient scheme construct family code example one find one-dimensional quantum code length n correct burst error width b comparison random-error correcting quantum code correct error must length n general show possible build quantum burst-correcting code near optimal dimension example show constant b exist b-burst-correcting quantum code length n dimension k n-log n -o b comparison hamming bound case constant random error yield k n log n
