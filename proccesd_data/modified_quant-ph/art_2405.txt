 quantum cryptography via parametric downconversion use quantum bit qubits cryptography hold promise secure cryptographic quantum key distribution scheme base usually single-photon polarization state unfortunately implemented qubits '' usual weak pulse experiment true two-level system quantum key distribution base imperfect qubits totally insecure presence high realistic loss rate work investigate another potential implementation qubits generate use process parametric downconversion find first two-photon second four-photon order parametric downconversion small parameter implementation quantum key distribution equivalent theoretical version realistic measurement take account quantum key distribution base parametric downconversion suffers also sensitivity extremely high nonrealistic loss choose small parameter process accord loss rate implementation quantum key distribution principle become secure attack study paper however adjust small parameter required level seem impractical weak pulse process hand easily do parametric downconversion process make much promising implementation
