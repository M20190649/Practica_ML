 quantum probability context depend probability study transformation conventional classical probability induce context transition demonstrate transition one complex condition another induces perturbation classical rule addition probabilistic alternative classify perturbation show two class perturbation trigonometric interference b hyperbolic interference particular well know quantum interference probabilistic alternative obtain classical contextual probabilistic framework therefore need apply wave argument consider superposition principle get quantum statistic particular interference could feature experiment purely corpuscular object
