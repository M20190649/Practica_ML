 measurement nondegenerate discrete observables every measurement quantum system cause state change system state measurement system state measurement conditional upon outcome measurement paper determine possible conditional state change cause measurement nondegenerate discrete observables purpose following condition show equivalent measurement nondegenerate discrete observables joint probability distribution outcome successive measurement depend affinely initial state ii apparatus indirect measurement model iii state change describe positive superoperator value measure iv state change describe completely positive superoperator value measure v output state independent input state family output state arbitrarily choose choice apparatus implication measurement problem discuss briefly
