 implementation quantum logic fundamental experimental limit quantum information processing rest ability manipulate quantum superposition coherent unitary transformation reality quantum information processor linear ion trap cavity qed implementation example exists dissipative environment dephasing technical source noise well fundamental source dissipation severely restrict quantum processing capability strength coherent couple need implement quantum logic always independent dissipation limitation dissipative influence present describe need efficient error correction note even long involved quantum computation turn hard realize one perform interesting manipulation entanglement involve gate qubits give example quantum communication also involve manipulation entanglement simpler implement elaborate computation briefly analyse notion capacity quantum communication channel
