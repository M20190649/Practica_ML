 decoherence trapped ion due polarization residual background gas investigate mechanism damp heating trapped ion associate polarization residual background gas induce oscillating ion reason analogy physic surface electron liquid helium demonstrate decay rabi oscillation observe experiment attribute polarization phenomenon investigate measured sensitivity damping rabi oscillation respect vibrational quantum number trapped ion also predict polarization model
