 coherent state quantization constraint system careful reexamination quantization system first- second-class constraint point view coherent-state phase-space path integration reveals several significant distinction conventional treatment significantly emphasize importance use path-integral measure lagrange multiplier ensure quantum system satisfy quantum constraint condition procedure involve delta-functionals classical constraint need gauge fixing first-class constraint need eliminate second-class constraint potentially ambiguous determinant virtue resolve difference canonical path-integral approach several example consider detail
