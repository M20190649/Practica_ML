 linear optic projective measurement alone suffice create large-photon-number path entanglement propose method prepare maximal path entanglement definite photon number n large two use projective measurement contrast previously know scheme method use linear optic specifically exhibit way generate four-photon path-entangled state form use four beam splitter two detector state major interest resource quantum interferometric sensor well optical quantum lithography quantum holography
