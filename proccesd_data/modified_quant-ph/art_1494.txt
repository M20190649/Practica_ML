 quantum analog huffman cod analyze generalization huffman cod quantum case particular notice various difficulty use instantaneous code quantum communication nevertheless storage quantum information succeed construct huffman-coding inspired quantum scheme number computational step encoding decode process n quantum signal make polylogarithmic depth massively parallel implementation quantum gate array compare n computational step require sequential implementation cleve divincenzo well-known quantum noiseless block cod scheme schumacher also show n log n computational step need communication quantum information use another huffman-coding inspire scheme sender must disentangle encode device receiver perform measurement signal
