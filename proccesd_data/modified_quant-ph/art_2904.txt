 separability xn composite quantum system analyze separability property density operator support c otimes c n whose partial transpose positive operator show rank rho equal n separable bound entangle state rank large n. also give separability criterion generic density operator sum rank one partial transpose exceed n. exceed number show one subtract product vector decrease n keep positivity rho partial transpose automatically give u sufficient criterion separability general density operator also prove density operator remain invariant partial transposition respect first system separable
