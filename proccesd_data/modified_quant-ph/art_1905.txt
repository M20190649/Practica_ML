 laser cooling two trapped ion sideband cool beyond lamb-dicke limit study laser cooling two ion trap harmonic potential interact coulomb repulsion sideband cooling lamb-dicke regime show work analogously sideband cooling single ion outside lamb-dicke regime incommensurable frequency two vibrational mode result quasi-continuous energy spectrum significantly alter cooling dynamic cooling time decrease nonlinearly linewidth cooling transition effect trap state may slow cooling considerably reduce show cool ground state possible also outside lamb-dicke regime develop model use quantum monte carlo calculation specific example show rate equation treatment good approximation case
