 open system approach calculate time dependent spectra new method calculate spectrum use cascade open system master equation present method use two state analyzer atom couple system interest whose spectrum radiation read excitation analyzer atom ordinary definition spectrum use two-time average fourier-transforms present method use one-time average method use calculate time dependent well stationary spectrum
