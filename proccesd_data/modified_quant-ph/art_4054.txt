 measurement qubits describe detail theory underpin measurement density matrix pair quantum two-level system qubits '' particular emphasis qubits realize two polarization degree freedom pair entangled photon generate down-conversion experiment however discussion applies general regardless actual physical realization two technique discuss namely tomographic reconstruction density matrix linearly relate set measured quantity maximum likelihood technique require numerical optimization advantage produce density matrix always non-negative definite addition detailed error analysis present allow error quantity derive density matrix entropy entanglement formation estimate example base down-conversion experiment use illustrate result
