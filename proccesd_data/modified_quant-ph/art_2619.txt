 new measure nonclassical distance propose new measure nonclassical distance case gaussian state let u consider two gaussian state one fix run set gaussian classical state maximum value fidelity two state use nonclassical distance fixed state set classical state extent hillery measure measure increase fixed state act gaussian noise map i.e select state becomes closer classical state
