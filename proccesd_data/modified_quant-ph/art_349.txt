 parity bit quantum cryptography n -bit string encode sequence non-orthogonal quantum state parity bit n -bit string describe one two density matrix rho n rho n hilbert space dimension n order derive parity bite receiver must distinguish two density matrix e.g. term optimal mutual information paper find measurement provide optimal mutual information parity bit calculate information prove information decrease exponentially length string case single bit state almost fully overlap believe result useful prove ultimate security quantum crytography presence noise
