 multiparty quantum communication complexity quantum entanglement use achieve direct communication remote party reduce communication need problem let k party hold partial input data fix k-variable function f. communication complexity f minimum number classical bit require broadcast every party know value f input construct function g one-round communication model three party g compute n bit communication party share prior entanglement show without entangled particle one-round communication complexity g n next generalize function function f. show party share prior quantum entanglement communication complexity f exactly k. also show entangled particle provide communication complexity f roughly k log k two result prove first time communication complexity separation well constant number bit
