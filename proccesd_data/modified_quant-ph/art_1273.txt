 spontaneous emission non-dispersive rydberg wave packet non dispersive electronic rydberg wave packet may create atom illuminate microwave field circular polarization discuss spontaneous emission state show elastic incoherent component occur frequency driving field dominate spectrum semiclassical limit contrary earlier prediction calculate frequency single photon emission associate rate harmonic approximation i.e wave packet approximately gaussian shape result agree well exact quantum mechanical calculation validate analytical approach
