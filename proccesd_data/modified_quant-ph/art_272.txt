 multiple particle interference quantum error correction concept multiple particle interference discuss use insight provide classical theory error correct code lead discussion error correction quantum communication channel quantum computer method error correction quantum regime present limitation assess quantum channel recover arbitrary decoherence x qubits k bit quantum information encode use n quantum bit k n great h x n must less h x n imply exponential reduction decoherence polynomial increase computing resource require therefore quantum computation make free error presence physically realistic level decoherence method also allow isolation quantum communication noise evesdropping quantum privacy amplification
