 interfere resonance quantum billiard present method numerically obtain position width wavefunctions resonance state two dimensional billiard connect waveguide rectangular billiard study dynamic three resonance pole lie separate one function increase couple strength waveguide billiard two state become trap width third one continue increase coupling strength behavior resonance pole reflect time delay function study experimentally
