 spatial asymmetry particle pair spin-statistics theorem discuss condition identical particle may yet distinguishable relationship particle permutation exchange show always define permutation-symmetric state vector particle completely indistinguishable exchange equivalent permutation therefore exchange eigenvalue permutation-symmetric state vector always exchange asymmetry arises particle physically distinguishable even though otherwise identical compute transformation arise distinguishing feature reverse fundamental spatial asymmetry relative orientation two vector common frame reference persist even limit vector coincide pair particle asymmetry spin quantization frame render distinguishable even otherwise identical conventional construction distinction properly account particle exchange equivalent reverse relative orientation -- require relative rotation pi spin quantization frame one particle respect thus result conventional exchange phase
