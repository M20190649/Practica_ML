 comprehensive experimental test quantum erasure interferometer path information interference visibility incompatible quantity complete determination path exclude possibility interference render visibility zero however composite object probe state pure certain condition possible trade path information improve conditioned visibility procedure call quantum erasure perform experiment polarization entangle photon pair use partial polarizer could vary degree entanglement object probe could also vary interferometer split ratio thereby vary priori path predictability test quantum erasure number different experimental condition find good agreement experiment theory
