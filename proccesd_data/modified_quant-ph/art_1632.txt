 fast quantum search algorithm bound recast grover 's generalise search algorithm geometric language even state approximately orthogonal provide possible search algorithm base arbitrary unitary transformation speed step still discuss low upper bound transition matrix element unitary operator change time thereby imply quantum search process fast slow remarkable feature quantum computation unlike classical one quantum mechanical uncertainty relation put bound search process also mention problem perturbation issue time-dependent search operation
