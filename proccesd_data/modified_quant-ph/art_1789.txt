 many time interpretation quantum measurement process many time interpretation mti propose stochastic quantum jump reduction concern single object ensemble represent consequence stochastic choice change time therefore single object experience local stochastically chosen time real macroscopic time real classical physic therefore instead indeterminism regard macroscopic time mti proposes determinism regard set stochastically choose local time within axiomatization include composite system single object apparatus environment mti lead recognize amplification process fundamental part measurement process ii nonvalidity schrodinger equation concern whole e make state reduction process unnecessary unphysical iii natural deducibility macroscopic irreversibility iv nonequivalence mti exist measurement theory interpretation thus within mti measurement problem reduce basically onto search quantum effect would allow forthe local stochastic change time
