 unified approach quantum capacity towards quantum noisy cod theorem base unified approach kind quantum capacity show rate quantum information transmission bound maximal attainable rate coherent information moreover show bipartite state one-way distillable entanglement less coherent information one obtain shannon-like formula capacity inequality also imply decrease distillable entanglement due mix process exceed corresponding loss information system
