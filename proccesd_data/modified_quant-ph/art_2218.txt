 effect motion cavity qed consider effect motion cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment single cold atom observe inside cavity many rabi cycle discuss timescales involve problem need good control atomic motion particularly heating due exchange excitation atom cavity order realize nearly unitary dynamic internal atomic state cavity mode require several scheme current interest quantum computing use simple model establish ultimate effect external atomic degree freedom action quantum gate perfomance gate characterize measure base entanglement fidelity motional excitation cause action gate calculate find scheme rely adiabatic passage therefore critically dependent laser pulse area much robust interaction external degree freedom atom quantum gate
