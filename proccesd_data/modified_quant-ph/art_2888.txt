 analysis radiatively stable entanglement system two dipole-interacting three-level atom explore possibility create radiatively stable entangled state two three-level dipole-interacting atom lambda configuration mean laser biharmonic continuous driving pulse propose three scheme generation entangled state involve low state lambda system vulnerable radiative decay two employ coherent dynamic achieve entanglement system whereas third one use optical pumping i.e. essentially incoherent process
