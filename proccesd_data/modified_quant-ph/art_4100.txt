 photon coincidence spectroscopy two-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics show photon coincidence spectroscopy provide unambiguous signature two atom simultaneously interact quantised cavity field mode also show single-atom jaynes-cummings model probe effectively via photon coincidence spectroscopy even deleterious contribution signal two-atom event addition explicitly solve eigenvectors eigenvalue two two-level atom couple quantised cavity mode differ couple strength
