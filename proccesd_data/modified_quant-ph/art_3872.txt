 coherent phenomenon photonic crystal study spontaneous emission absorption dispersion property bf lambda -type atom one transition interact near resonantly double-band photonic crystal assume isotropic dispersion relation near band edge show two distinct coherent phenomenon occur first spontaneous emission spectrum adjacent free space transition obtain dark line zero spectrum second atom become transparent probe laser field couple adjacent free space transition
