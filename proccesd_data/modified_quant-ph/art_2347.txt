 generalize spin- operator eigenvectors recently show interpretation quantum mechanic due lande use derive first principle generalize formula operator eigenvectors spin though give operator component spin give eigenvectors operator x component spin give vector addition present new simple method derive operator x component spin well vector z component give general proof operator square spin unit matrix multiply value square spin
