 schwinger pegg barnett relationship angular cartesian quantum description development original idea due schwinger show possible recover quantum description degree freedom characterize finite number state qtr i.e without classical counterpart usual canonical variable position momentum qtr angle angular momentum relate maybe surprisingly first limit later
