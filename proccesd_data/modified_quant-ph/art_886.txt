 quantum computation decision tree many interesting computational problem reformulate term decision tree natural classical algorithm run random walk tree start root see tree contain node n level root devise quantum mechanical algorithm evolve state initially localize root tree prove classical strategy succeed reach level n time polynomial n quantum algorithm moreover find example tree classical algorithm require time exponential n quantum algorithm succeed polynomial time example far however could also solve polynomial time different classical algorithm
