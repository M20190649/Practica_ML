 compute local invariant qubit system investigate mean describe non-local property quantum system test two quantum system locally equivalent consider quantum system consist several subsystem especially multiple qubits compute invariant polynomial i. e. polynomial function entry density operator invariant local unitary operation example consider system two qubits compute molien series corresponding representation give information number linearly independent invariant furthermore present set polynomial generate invariant least degree finally use invariant check whether two density operator locally equivalent demonstrate
