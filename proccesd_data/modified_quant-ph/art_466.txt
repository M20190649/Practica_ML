 quantum correlation local interaction error correction consider effect local interaction upon quantum mechanically entangled system particular demonstrate non-local correlation increase local operation subsystem use quantum error correction method correlation maintain provide two mathematical proof local general measurement increase correlation also derive general condition quantum error correct code use show local quantum error correction preserve nonlocal feature entangled quantum system also demonstrate result use specific example employ correlated optical cavity interact locally resonant atom way counter example also describe mechanism correlation increase demonstrate need non-local interaction
