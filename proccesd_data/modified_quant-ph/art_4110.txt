 qed derive two-body interaction mapping m-space show previous paper dirac bispinor vary like four-vector quantum electrodynamics qed reproduce form behaviour part paper show qed transformational behaviour also hold alternative space call m-space use four-vector behaviour model two-body interaction show similar physical property usual model predict part paper use m-space show qed reduce two simple rule two-body interaction
