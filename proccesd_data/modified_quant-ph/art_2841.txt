 maxwell equation one-photon quantum equation maxwell equation faraday ampere-maxwell law present three component equation way similar two component neutrino equation however case electric magnetic gauss 's law derive first principle show maxwell equation derive simultaneously first principle similar use derive dirac relativistic electron equation also show equation massless particle derive dirac lead result complex wave function linear combination electric magnetic field locally measurable well understood quantity therefore maxwell equation use guideline proper interpretation quantum theory
