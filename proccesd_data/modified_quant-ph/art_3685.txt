 relativistic aharonov-casher phase spin one aharonov-casher ac phase calculate relativistic wave equation spin one ac phase previously calculate dirac-pauli equation use gauge-like technique cite mk mk spin-one case use kemmer theory dirac-like particle theory calculate phase similar manner however vector formalism proca theory widely know use presence electromagnetic field two theory equivalent may transform one another adapt transformation show kemmer theory result apply proca theory calculate aharonov-casher phase spin-one particle directly proca formalism
