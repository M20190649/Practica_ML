 quantum key distribution string oblivious transfer noisy channel prove unconditional security quantum key distribution qkd protocol noisy channel general attack allow quantum physic use fact previous paper reduce proof unconditionally security qkd protocol proof corresponding quantum string oblivious transfer string-qot protocol would unconditionally secure bob implement top unconditionally secure bit commitment scheme prove lemma extend security proof give yao one bit qot protocol string-qot protocol result reduction mention implies unconditional security qkd protocol despite previous proof unconditionally secure bit commitment scheme impossible
