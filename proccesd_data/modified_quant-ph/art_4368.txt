 necessary sufficient condition optimal decomposition important measure bipartite entanglement entanglement formation define minimum average pure state entanglement decomposition realize give state decomposition achieve minimum call optimal decomposition however entanglement formation much know structure optimal decomposition except special case like state two qubits isotropic state present necessary sufficient condition set pure state finite dimensional bipartite system form optimal decomposition condition well suit treat question whether entanglement formation additive
