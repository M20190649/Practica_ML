 quantum repeater base entanglement purification study use entanglement purification quantum communication long distance distance much long coherence length corresponding noisy quantum channel fidelity transmission usually low standard purification method applicable however possible divide channel short segment purify separately connect method entanglement swapping method much efficient scheme base quantum error correction make explicit use two-way classical communication important question noise introduce imperfect local operation constitute protocol purification entanglement swapping accumulate compound channel keep certain noise level treat problem first study applicability efficiency entanglement purification protocol situation imperfect local operation present scheme allow entanglement purification arbitrary long channel tolerate error per-cent level require polynomial overhead time overhead local resource grow logarithmically length channel
