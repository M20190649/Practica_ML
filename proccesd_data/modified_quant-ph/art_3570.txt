 low-energy relativistic effect nonlocality time-dependent tunneling consider exact time-dependent analytic solution schr odinger equation tunnel one dimension cut wave initial condition obtain soon neq transmitted probability density arbitrary distance rise instantaneously time linear manner use simple model find nonlocal effect time-dependent solution suppress consideration low-energy relativistic effect hence distance x potential probability density rise time x c restore einstein causality imply tunneling time particle never zero
