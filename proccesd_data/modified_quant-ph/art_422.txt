 laser pulse measurement application quantum zeno effect short pulse probe laser use past measure whether two-level atom ground excited state probe pulse couple ground state third auxiliary level atom occurrence absence resonance fluorescence take mean atom find ground excited state respectively paper investigate extent procedure result effective measurement projection postulate apply least approximately discuss detail complication arise additional time development two-level system proper probe pulse extend previous result weak probe pulse general case show one model ideal projection-postulate measurement much well strong weak probe pulse application quantum zeno effect calculate slow-down atomic time development n repeat probe pulse measurement determine correction compare case n ideal measurement
