 stabilization deterministically chaotic system interference quantum measurement ikeda map case propose method effectively stabilize fixed point classical quantum dynamic phase-sensitive chaotic system feedback base feed back select quantum sub-ensemble whose phase amplitude stabilize otherwise chaotic dynamic although method rather general apply realization inherently chaotic ikeda map one suggest realization involve mach-zender interferometer kerr nonlinearity another realization involve trapped ion interact laser field
