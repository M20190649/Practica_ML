 floquet-markov description parametrically drive dissipative harmonic quantum oscillator use parametrically drive harmonic oscillator working example study two different markovian approach quantum dynamic periodically driven system dissipation simpler approach driving enter master equation reduced density operator hamiltonian term improved master equation achieve treat entire driven system within floquet formalism couple reservoir whole different ensue evolution equation compare various representation particularly fokker-planck equation wigner function level approximation evolution equation retain periodicity driving solution floquet form represent eigenfunctions non-unitary propagator single period driving discuss asymptotic state long-time limit well conservative high-temperature limit numerical result obtain within different markov approximation compare exact path-integral solution application improved floquet-markov scheme become increasingly important consider strong driving low temperature
