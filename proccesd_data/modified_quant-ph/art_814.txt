 reliable quantum computer new field quantum error correction develop spectacularly since origin less two year ago encode quantum information protect error arise due uncontrolled interaction environment recovery error work effectively even occasional mistake occur recovery procedure furthermore encode quantum information process without serious propagation error hence arbitrarily long quantum computation perform reliably provide average probability error per quantum gate less certain critical value accuracy threshold quantum computer store qubits probability error per quantum gate order would formidable factoring engine even small less accurate quantum computer would able perform many useful task paper base talk present itp conference quantum coherence decoherence december
