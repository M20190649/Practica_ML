 quantum interference two temporally distinguishable pulse report two-photon interference effect entangled photon pair generate two laser pulse well-separated time single pump pulse case interference effect occur experimental scheme however introduce second pump pulse delay time quantum interference observe visibility interference fringe show dependence delay time two laser pulse result explain term indistinguishability biphoton amplitude originate two temporally separate laser pulse
