 quantum communication atomic ensemble use coherent light protocol quantum communication massive particle atom usually base transmit nonclassical light super-high finesse optical cavity normally need enhance interaction atom photon demonstrate surprising result unknown quantum state teleport one free-space atomic ensemble transmit coherent light non-classical light cavity need scheme greatly simplify experimental implementation
