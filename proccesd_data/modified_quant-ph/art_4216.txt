 quantum walk hypercube recently show one-dimensional quantum walk mix quickly classical random walk suggest quantum monte carlo algorithm outperform classical counterpart study two quantum walk n-dimensional hypercube one discrete time one continuous time case show quantum walk mix pi n step fast n log n step require classical walk continuous-time case probability distribution em exactly uniform time importantly walk expose several subtlety definition mixing time quantum walk even though continuous-time walk n instantaneous mixing time precisely uniform never approach uniform distribution stopping time choose randomly aharonovakv analysis treat interference term different phase carefully necessary walk cycle previous general bound predict exponential rather linear mix time hypercube
