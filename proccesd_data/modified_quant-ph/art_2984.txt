 coherent information analysis quantum channel simple quantum system coherent information concept use analyze variety simple quantum system coherent information calculate information decay two-level atom presence external resonant field information exchange two couple two-level atom information transfer two-level atom another atom photon field coherent information show equal zero full-measurement procedure completely retain original value quantum duplication transmission information one open subsystem another one entire closed system analyze learn quantum information forbidden atomic transition via dipole active transition atom argue coherent information use effectively quantify information channel physical system quantum coherence play important role
