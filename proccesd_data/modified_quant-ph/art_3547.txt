 generalized weyl relation approach time operator connection survival probability time operator operator satisfy canonical commutation relation hamiltonian investigate basis certain algebraic relation pair operator h symmetric h self-adjoint relation equivalent weyl relation case self-adjoint satisfy aharonov-bohm time operator free hamiltonian h one-dimensional free-particle system order see qualitative property operator h satisfy algebraic relation examine particular show standard deviation directly connect survival probability h absolutely continuous hence conclude existence operator imply existence scatter state also show minimum uncertainty state exist example operator h one-dimensional free-particle system demonstrate
