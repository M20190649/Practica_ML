 robustness multi-party entanglement common large-scale entanglement nature first step towards address question study robustness multi-party entanglement local decoherence model partially depolarize channel act independently subsystem surprisingly find n-qubit ghz entanglement stand local depolarization limit n go infinity ghz state robust generic state qubits also study spin-squeezed state limit n go infinity find stand considerable local depolarization
