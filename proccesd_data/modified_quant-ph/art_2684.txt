 optical qubit conditional interferometry suggest method prepare chosen superposition vacuum one-photon state method base conditional double-interferometer feed one-photon state coherent state scheme involve linear optical element avalanche photodetectors therefore realizable current technology realistic description trigger photodetectors employ i.e assume check certain efficiency whether photon present discuss two work regime show output state fidelity arbitrarily close unit may obtain non vanish conditional probability also low quantum efficiency photodetectors
