 limit squeeze degenerate opo develop systematic theory quantum fluctuation driven parametric oscillator opo include region near threshold allow u treat limit impose nonlinearities quantum squeezing noise reduction non-equilibrium quantum phase-transition particular compute squeezing spectrum near threshold calculate optimum value find optimal noise reduction occur different drive field depend ratio damp rate large spectral noise reduction predict occur high-q second-harmonic cavity analytic result agree well stochastic numerical simulation also compare result obtain positive-p representation fully quantum mechanical calculation truncated wigner phase space equation also know semiclassical theory
