 non-maximally entangled state production characterization utilization use spontaneous-downconversion photon source produce true non-maximally entangled state i.e. without need post-selection degree phase entanglement readily tunable characterize standard analysis use coincidence minimum quantum state tomography two-photon state use latter experimentally reconstruct reduced density matrix polarization finally use state measure hardy fraction obtain result sigma local-realistic result
