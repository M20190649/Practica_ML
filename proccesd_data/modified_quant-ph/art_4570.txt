 new laser cooling concept molecular translational motion propose laser cooling concept translational motion molecule require repeat spontaneous emission molecule cooling work repetition three main step velocity selection narrow momentum width deceleration velocity select molecule accumulation decelerated molecule irreversible process namely single spontaneous emission develop cooling model enable analytical description transient population entropy total molecular system center mass degree freedom internal degree freedom simulation show cool process reduce large momentum width final width principle arbitrarily small center mass entropy reduce internal entropy increase cool show translational cooling occur coherent laser interaction entropy change consistency araki-lieb inequality
