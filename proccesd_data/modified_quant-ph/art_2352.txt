 good dynamic versus bad kinematics entanglement need quantum computation consider quantum compute pseudo-pure state framework arise certain implementation quantum compute use nmr analyze quantum computational protocol aim solve exponential classical problem polynomial resource ask whether entanglement pseudo-pure state need achieve aim show large class protocol include shor 's factorization entanglement necessary also show achieve entanglement sufficient noise state sufficiently large exponential resource need even entanglement present
