 experimental proposal achieve superadditive communication capacity binary quantum alphabet demonstrate superadditivity communication capacity binary alphabet consist two nonorthogonal quantum state scheme collective decoding perform two transmission time improve upon previous scheme sasaki et al phys rev superadditivity achieve decoding three transmission time place superadditivity within regime near-term laboratory demonstration propose experimental test base upon alphabet low photon-number coherent state signal decoding do atomic state measurement single atom high-finesse optical cavity
