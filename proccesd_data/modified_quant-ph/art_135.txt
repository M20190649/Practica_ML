 variational resummation divergent series know large-order behavior recently-developed variational perturbation expansion converge exponentially fast positive coupling constant however posse correct left-hand cut complex coupling constant plane imply wrong large-order behavior taylor expansion coefficient correct deficiency present method resumming divergent series proper large-order behavior give set expansion coefficient knowledge large-order behavior considerably improve quality approximation
