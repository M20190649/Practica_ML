 quantum mechanical probability general probabilistic constraint einstein-podolsky-rosen-bohm experiment relativistic causality namely impossibility signal superluminal speed restrict kind correlation occur different part composite physical system establish basic restriction relativistic causality imposes joint probability involve experiment einstein-podolsky-rosen-bohm type quantum mechanic hand place restriction beyond require general consideration like causality consistency illustrate fact consider sum correlation involve chsh inequality within general framework chsh inequality also consider nonlocality theorem derive hardy discuss constraint relativistic causality one hand quantum mechanic hand impose finally derive simple inequality use test quantum mechanic general probabilistic theory
