 connection special relativity charge conservation quantum mechanic examination einstein energy-momentum relationship suggest simple unbound form matter exist four-dimensional euclidean space position momentum velocity vector quantity express euclidean four-vectors magnitude velocity vector constant value speed light see charge may simply manifestation momentum new fourth direction imply charge conservation form momentum conservation constancy speed implies elementary free particle describe manner photon mean wave equation result wave mechanic small assumption simply traditional form quantum mechanic one begin assume wave nature matter show special relativistic result follow simply thus see evidence strong connection relativity quantum mechanic comparison theory present kaluza-klein theory reveal similarity also many significant difference
