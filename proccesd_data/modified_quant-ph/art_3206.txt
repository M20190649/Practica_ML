 derivation standard treatment spin addition probability amplitude recent paper introduce new way treat system compounded angular momentum obtain probability amplitudes measurement system use derive matrix treatment compounded spin however matrix form dimensional space therefore entirely different standard form raise question connection form standard form paper answer question derive standard matrix treatment spin addition discover generalized form theory apply new generalized theory singlet triplet state arise addition spin two system spin obtain new generalize form vector operator case show reduce standard form appropriate limit
