 fundamental relativity providing time distance velocity standard paper present attempt suggest alternative way consider fundamental einstein 's special relativity theory formulation base introduce inertial reference system rigid linking clock free entity define proper time self-contradictory since operation rigid link involves interaction exclude definition free entity way overcome inconsistency propose postulate free entity object particle ideal clock provide ideal internal time standard define intrinsic feature free entity namely proper mass mean de broglie 's periodic phenomenon consider fundamental principle need build special relativity along principle indistinguishability allow define particle 's proper mass ideal accuracy internal distance standard provide pass compton wavelength velocity standard introduce mean hubble 's law propose interpret wave function internal system reference undergoing distortion external interaction include
