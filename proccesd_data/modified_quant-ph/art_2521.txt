 quantum gate clifford algebra clifford algebra use definition spinors use spin- system adequate model quantum bit relation algebra quantum information science physical reason simple mathematical property algebra also justifies application first complex clifford algebra n generator cl n c representation algebra n x n complex matrix include unitary matrix quantum n-gate arbitrary element whole algebra corresponds general form linear complex transformation last property also useful linear operator necessary unitary use description restriction unitary operator subspace second advantage simple algebraic structure cl n express via tenzor product standard build unit similar behavior composite quantum system compact notation n generator also use software modeling simple quantum circuit modern conventional computer
