 information noise photon entanglement use finite resolution measurement possible simultaneously obtain noisy information two non-commuting polarization component single photon method apply pair entangled photon polarization statistic violate bell 's inequality theoretically predict result show non-classical nature entanglement arises negative joint probability non-commuting polarization component negative probability allow disentanglement statistic provide new insight non-classical property quantum information
