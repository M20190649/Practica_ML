 quantum zeno effect light-dark period single atom quantum zeno effect qze predict slow-down time development system rapidly repeat ideal measurement experimentally test ensemble atom use short laser pulse non-selective state measurement consider pulse selective measurement single system probe pulse cause burst fluorescence fluorescence probe pulse strictly ideal measurement qze would predict period fluorescence burst alternate period fluorescence light dark period would become long longer increase frequency measurement non-ideal character measurement take account incorporate laser pulse interaction use determine correction ideal case limit time laser pulse go zero freezing occur instead show convergence familiar macroscopic light dark period continuously drive dehmelt system experiment type feasible single atom ion trap
