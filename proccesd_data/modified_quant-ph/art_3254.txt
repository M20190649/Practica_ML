 coherent state non-linear algebra application quantum optic present general unified approach find coherent state polynomially deform algebra quadratic higgs algebra relevant various multiphoton process quantum optic give general procedure map deform algebra appropriate lie algebra use non compact case obtain annihilation operator coherent state find canonical conjugate operator generalize coherent state perelomov sense also follow construction allow u explicitly construct coherent state associate various quantum optical system
