 sample canonical phase phase-space function discuss possibility sample exponential moment canonical phase s-parametrized phase space function show sampling kernel exist well-behaved whereas kernel diverge origin spite show phase space moment sample predefined accuracy q-function measure double-homodyne scheme perfect detector discuss effect imperfect detection address sample scheme use measurable phase-space function finally discuss problem sample canonical phase distribution
