 casimir effect thermodynamic instability one loop field theory calculation free energy quite often yield violation stability condition associate thermodynamic second law perhaps best known example involve equation state black hole point casimir force two parallel conduct plate also violate thermodynamic stability condition normally associate second law thermodynamics
