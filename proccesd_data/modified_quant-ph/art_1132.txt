 grover 's quantum search algorithm optimal improve tight bound quantum searching boyer et al quant-ph matching bound thus show probability success grovers quantum search algorithm optimal e.g near certain success query oracle pi sqrt n time n size search space also show unfortunately quantum search parallelize good assign different part search space independent quantum computer earlier result leave open possibility efficient parallelization
