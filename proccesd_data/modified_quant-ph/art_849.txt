 ground state laser cool beyond lamb-dicke limit propose laser cool scheme allow cool single atom confine harmonic potential trap ground state scheme assume strong confinement oscillation frequency trap large effective spontaneous decay width restrict lamb-dicke limit i.e size trap ground state large optical wavelength cool scheme may useful context quantum computation ion bose-einstein condensation
