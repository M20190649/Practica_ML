 homodyne detection measure coherent phase state distribution use coherent phase state parameterized phase state distribution single-mode radiation field introduce integral relation phase-parameterized field-strength distribution study integral kernel evaluate problem direct sampling coherent phase state distribution use balanced homodyne detection consider numerical simulation show value smoothing parameter small coherent phase state distribution obtain sufficiently well accuracy decrease value smoothing parameter determination coherent phase state distribution may effort numerical calculation sampling function measurement field-strength distribution require perform drastically increase accuracy
