 nmr quantum logic gate homonuclear spin system nmr system use practical quantum computer number coupled spin need large feasible rely purely heteronuclear spin system implementation quantum logic gate imposes certain constraint motion spin directly involve gate so-called spectator spin must return initial state end sequence result homonuclear spin system appreciable couple every pair spin would seem require refocusing scheme double complexity duration every additional spectator spin fortunately realistic practical case long-range spin-spin coupling neglect simpler refocus scheme devise overall duration sequence remain constant number soft pulse increase linearly number spectator spin idea test experimentally six qubit system six couple proton inosine
