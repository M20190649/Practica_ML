 representation joint measurement quantum mechanic refutation quantum teleportation inconsistency point within quantum mechanic soon successive joint measurement involve entangled state resolution inconsistency lead refutation use entangled state eigenvectors hence concept quantum teleportation base use entangled state -- bell state -- eigenvectors demonstrate irrelevant quantum mechanic
