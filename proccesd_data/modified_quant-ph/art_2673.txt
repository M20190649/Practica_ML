 coherent property tripod system couple via continuum present result study coherence property system involve three discrete state couple two-photon process via common continuum tripod linkage extension standard laser-induced continuum structure lics involve two discrete state two laser show tripod scheme exist two population trap condition case condition easy satisfy single trapping condition two-state lics depend pulse timing various effect observe derive basic property tripod scheme solution coincident pulse behaviour system adiabatic limit delayed pulse condition ionization maximal ionization optimal condition population transfer discrete state via continuum case one discrete state strongly couple continuum population dynamic reduce standard two-state lics problem involve two state modified parameter provide opportunity customize parameter give two-state lics system
