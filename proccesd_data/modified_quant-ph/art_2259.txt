 quantum soliton generation use interferometer first time method realize macroscopic quantum optical soliton present simultaneous photon-number momentum squeezing predict use soliton propagation interferometer extraction soliton pulse closer true quantum soliton coherent counterpart mode-locked laser possible moreover general method reduce photon-number fluctuation shot-noise level non-soliton pulse well anticipate similar reduction particle fluctuation could occur form interfere bosonic field whenever self-interaction nonlinearities exist example interact ultracold atom
