 universal construction unitary transformation quantum computation one- two-body interaction unitary transformation quantum computational network explicitly decompose exact unified form sequence limited number one-qubit quantum gate two-qubit diagonal gate diagonal unitary representation usual computational basis decomposition may simplify greatly help property finite-dimensional multiple-quantum operator algebra space quantum system specific property give quantum algorithm elementary building block quantum computation two-qubit diagonal gate one-qubit gate may construct physically one- two-body interaction two-state quantum system hence could conveniently realize experimentally present work helpful implement generally n-qubit quantum computation feasible two-state quantum system determine conveniently time evolution system course quantum computation
