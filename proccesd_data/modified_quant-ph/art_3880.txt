 new method obtain complex root semiclassical coherent-state propagator formula semiclassical formula coherent-state propagator require determination specific classical path inhabit complex phase-space hamiltonian flux trajectory constrain special boundary condition render determination difficult common method paper present new method base runge-kutta integrator quick easy accurate determination trajectory use nonlinear one dimensional system show semiclassical formula highly accurate compare exact counterpart clarify phase semiclassical approximation correctly retrieve time evolution
