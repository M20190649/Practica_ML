 isolation expulsion divergence quantum field theory divergence arise quantization scalar quantum field model mean lattice-space functional integration may attribute single integration variable fact demonstrate show integrand single integration variable appropriately change perturbation expansion become order-by-order finite divergence free paper conclude brief review current proposal auxiliary nonclassical potential add lattice action relativistic scalar field quantization may automatically render analogous change integrand thus may lead well nontrivial divergence-free result
