 geometric quantum computation nmr experimental realisation basic constituent quantum information processing device namely fault-tolerant quantum logic gate require conditional quantum dynamic one subsystem undergo coherent evolution depend quantum state another subsystem particular subsystem may acquire conditional phase shift consider novel scenario phase geometric rather dynamical origin conditional geometric berry phase depend geometry path execute resilient certain type error offer potential intrinsically fault-tolerant way perform quantum gate nuclear magnetic resonance nmr already use demonstrate simple quantum information processing berry 's phase report nmr experiment implement conditional berry phase thus controlled phase shift gate constitute first elementary geometric quantum computation
