 transverse-mode coupling kerr medium analyze nonlinear transverse mode couple kerr medium place optical cavity influence bistability different kind quantum noise reduction even input beam perfectly match cavity mode nonlinear coupling produce excess noise fluctuation output beam intensity squeeze seem particularly robust respect mode coupling quadrature squeezing sensitive however possible find mode quadrature squeezing affect coupling
