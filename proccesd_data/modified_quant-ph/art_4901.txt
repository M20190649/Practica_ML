 universal continuous-variable quantum computation requirement optical nonlinearity photon counting although universal continuous-variable quantum computation achieve via linear optic include squeezing homodyne detection feed-forward inclusion ideal photon counting measurement overcome obstacle measurement sometimes describe array beam splitter distribute photon across several mode show scheme use implement ideal photon counting measurement necessarily involve nonlinear evolution however requirement nonlinearity move off-line thereby permit universal continuous-variable quantum computation linear optic
