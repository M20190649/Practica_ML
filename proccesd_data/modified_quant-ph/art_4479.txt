 canonical transformation squeeze quantum mechanic paper present approach quantum mechanical canonical transformation main result time dependent quantum canonical transformation always cast form squeeze operator revise main property operator regard lie group property two combine yield another operator class also decompose fragment second part paper show procedure work extremely well time dependent quantum harmonic oscillator issue systematic construction quantum canonical transformation also discuss along line dirac wigner schwinger idea recent work lee main conclusion classical phase space transformation maintain operator formalism construction quantum canonical transformation clearly relate classical generate function classical canonical transformation propose road squeeze operator rather old one attach quantum operator construct guideline exponential classical generating function
