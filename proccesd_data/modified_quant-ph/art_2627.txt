 scheme parallel quantum computation without local control qubits typical quantum compute scheme require transformation gate target specific element qubits many physical system direct targeting difficult achieve alternative encode local gate globally apply transformation demonstrate minimum physical requirement approach one-dimensional array compose two alternate 'types two-state system system need sensitive net state near neighbor i.e number state minus number state additionally show array perform quite general parallel operation broad range physical system interaction suitable highlight two potential implementation
