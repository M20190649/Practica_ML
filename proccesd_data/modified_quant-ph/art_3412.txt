 quantum amplitude amplification estimation consider boolean function chi x partition set x good bad element x good chi x bad otherwise consider also quantum algorithm mathcal rangle sum x x alpha x x rangle quantum superposition element x let denote probability good element produce rangle measure repeat process run measure output use chi check validity result shall expect repeat time average solution find amplitude amplification process allow find good x expected number application inverse proportional sqrt assume algorithm make measurement generalization grover 's search algorithm restrict produce equal superposition member x promise single x exist chi x algorithm work whether value know ahead time case value know find good x number application inverse proportional sqrt even bad case show quadratic speedup also obtain large family search problem good classical heuristic exist finally main result combine idea grover 's shor 's quantum algorithm perform amplitude estimation process allow estimate value apply amplitude estimation problem approximate counting wish estimate number x x chi x obtain optimal quantum algorithm variety setting
