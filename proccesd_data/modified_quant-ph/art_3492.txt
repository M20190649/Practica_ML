 strict detector-efficiency bound n-site clauser-horne inequality analysis detector-efficiency many-site clauser-horne inequality present case perfect visibility show violation presented n-site clauser-horne inequality efficiency great n n- thus two-site two-setting experiment quantum-mechanical prediction violate local realism unless efficiency great secondly n-site experiment quantum-mechanical prediction violate local realism whenever efficiency exceed
