 breakdown flash silicon avalance photodiodes backdoor eavesdropper attack silicon avalanche photodiodes sensitive photodetectors visible near infrared region however use single photon detection geiger mode know emit light control breakdown use detect photoelectron fluorescence light might serious impact experimental application like quantum cryptography single-particle spectroscopy characterize fluorescence behaviour silicon avalanche photodiodes experimentally simple passive quenching configuration discuss implication use quantum cryptography system
