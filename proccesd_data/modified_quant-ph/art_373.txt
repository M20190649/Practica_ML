 exponential decay wavelength dissipative system apply technique develop recent work calculate wavefunction evolution dissipative system ohmic friction show wavelength wavefunction decay exponentially brownian motion width gradually increase interference experiment two parameter become equal brownian motion erase fringe system thus approaches classical limit show wavelength decay observable phenomenon
