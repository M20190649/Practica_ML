 rotation eigenvectors spin easily deduce fact four-component spin state massive particle linear combination pair two-component simultaneous rotation eigenstates simultaneous mean eigenspinors give pair share eigenvalue new work construct reverse give pair simultaneous rotation eigenvectors property pair contain relationship equivalent spin single particle equation thus needed aspect space-time symmetry produce special case general property already present rotation group exercise exploit flexibility rotation group three dimension deduce relativistic quantity four dimension
