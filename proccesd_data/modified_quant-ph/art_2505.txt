 periodic hamiltonian berry 's phase harmonic oscillator time-dependent tau -periodic harmonic oscillator two linearly independent homogeneous solution classical equation motion bound time stable show representation state cyclic multiplicative constant tau -evolution tau -evolution depend model set wave function complete berry 's phase could depend choice representation define tau tau -evolution representation homogeneous solution diverges time go infinity show berry 's phase define representation consider berry 's phase driven harmonic oscillator also consider case berry 's phase define phase give term solution classical equation motion
