 entanglement sharing among qudits consider system consist n d-dimensional quantum particle qudits suppose want optimize entanglement pair one ask following basic question regard sharing entanglement large possible value emax n minimum entanglement two particle system take entanglement formation measure entanglement n system three qubits answer know emax paper consider first system qudits show emax great equal consider system three particle three different value d. result three-particle case suggest dimension increase particle share great fraction entanglement capacity
