 origin noisy state whose teleportation fidelity enhance dissipation recently badziag emph et al cite badziag obtain class noisy state whose teleportation fidelity enhance subject one qubits dissipative interaction environment via amplitude damp channel adc show noisy state result share state phi pm frac sqrt pm across adc also show similar dissipative interaction different bell state give rise noisy entangled state qualitatively different sense noisy entangle state construct bell state phi pm emph make well sometimes subject unaffected qubit dissipative interaction environment importantly noisy state non teleport always make teleport prescription derive general restriction improvement noisy state assume damp parameter different qubits however curious prescription work noisy entangle state generate psi pm frac sqrt pm show apriori knowledge noisy channel might helpful decide bell state need share alice bob emph
