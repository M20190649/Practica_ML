 sub-femtosecond determination transmission delay time dielectric mirror photonic bandgap function angle incidence use two-photon interference technique measure delay single-photon wavepackets transmit multilayer dielectric mirror function photonic bandgap '' medium vary angle incidence able confirm behavior predict group delay stationary phase approximation include variation delay time superluminal subluminal band edge tune towards wavelength photon agreement theory good femtosecond less one quarter optical period except large angle incidence source remain discrepancy yet fully understood
