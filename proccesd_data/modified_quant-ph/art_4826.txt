 path integration quantum computer study path integration quantum computer perform quantum summation assume measure path integration gaussian eigenvalue covariance operator order j -k k wiener measure occur many application k want compute e -approximation path integral whose integrands least lipschitz prove path integration quantum computer tractable path integration quantum computer solve roughly e time faster classical computer use randomization exponentially fast classical computer bad case assurance .the number quantum query square root number function value need classical computer use randomization precisely number quantum query e furthermore low bound obtain minimal number quantum query show bound significantly improve .the number qubits polynomial e furthermore wiener measure degree lipschitz function degree smooth integrands
