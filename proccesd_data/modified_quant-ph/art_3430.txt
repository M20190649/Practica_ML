 macroscopic interference effect resonant cavity investigate possibility interference effect induce macroscopic quantum-mechanical superposition almost othogonal coherent state schroedinger cat state resonant microcavity despite fact single atom use probe cat state average change mean number photon one unit show single atom change system drastically interference initial almost orthogonal macroscopic quantum state radiation field take place dissipation current experimental condition take account find necessarily change intereference effect dramatically
