 observation nonclassical photon statistic due quantum interference nonclassical effect photon anti-bunching observe mixed field narrow band two-photon source coherent field certain condition variety different feature photon statistic find consequence two-photon interference effect dependence relative phase field besides anti-bunching effect find another one feature also nonclassical feature emphasize importance quantum entanglement
