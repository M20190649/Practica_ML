 framework structured quantum search quantum algorithm general combinatorial search use underlying structure search space increase probability find solution present algorithm show coherent quantum system match underlying structure abstract search space analytically simple previous structure search method algorithm evaluate empirically variety search problem show particularly effective search many constraint furthermore algorithm provide simple framework utilize search heuristic also exhibit phase transition search difficulty find sophisticated classical search method indicate effectively use problem structure
