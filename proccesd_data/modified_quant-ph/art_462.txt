 reduce quantum error improve large scale quantum cryptography noise cause severe difficulty implement quantum computing quantum cryptography several scheme suggest reduce problem mainly focus quantum computation motivate quantum cryptography suggest coding use n quantum bit n n encode one quantum bit reduce error exponentially n result suggest possibility distribute secure key long distance maintain quantum state long time also provide new quantum privacy amplification strong adversary
