 quantum correlation local amplitude resolution einstein-podolsky-rosen nonlocality puzzle einstein-podolsky-rosen nonlocality puzzle recognize one important unresolved issue foundational aspect quantum mechanic show problem resolve quantum correlation calculate directly local quantity preserve phase information quantum system assume strict locality probability amplitudes instead local realism outcome calculate amplitude correlation function.then experimentally observed correlation outcome calculate square amplitude correlation function locality amplitude implies measurement one particle collapse companion particle definite state apart resolve epr puzzle approach show physical interpretation apparently nonlocal effect like quantum teleportation entanglement swapping different usually assume bell type measurement change distant state yet correlation correctly reproduce measure complex probability amplitude treat basic local quantity example discuss quantum correlation two-particle maximally entangled state three-particle ghz entangle state
