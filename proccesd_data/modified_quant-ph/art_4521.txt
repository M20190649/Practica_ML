 nonsequential positive-operator-valued measurement entangled mixed state always violate bell inequality present local-hidden-variable model positive-operator-valued measurement lhvpov model class entangled generalized werner state thus demonstrate measurement always violate bell-type inequality also show general state rho obtain rho certainty local quantum operation without classical communication lhvpov model state rho imply existence model rho
