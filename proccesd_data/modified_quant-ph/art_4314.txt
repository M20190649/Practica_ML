 high order quantum decoherence via multi-particle amplitude boson system paper depict high order quantum coherence boson system use multi-particle wave amplitude whose norm square high order correlation function multi-time amplitude show superposition several multi-particle path environment apparatus entangles form generalized which-way measurement many particle system quantum decoherence happen high order case dynamically explicit illustration also give intracavity system two mode interact move mirror
