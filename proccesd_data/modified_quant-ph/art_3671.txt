 large-angle single-order one two-dimensional atomic interferometry creation nanostructures show via explicit analysis well numerical simulation design two large angle interferometer employ two-photon pulse first one use technique adiabatic following dark state produce large splitting angle atomic interferometer capable produce one dimensional grating spacing small nm unlike large angle interferometer technique sensitive error optical pulse area decoherence excited state decay may lead nearly two order magnitude improvement sensitivity device atomic gyroscope already good best laser gyroscope second interferometer use technique raman pulse produce two-dimensional interferometer independent choice grate spacing direction small nm scheme may enable one produce uniform array quantum dot dimension nm side addition may possible generalize process produce arbitrary pattern type resolution
