 quantum statistic atom microstructures paper propose groove-like potential structure observation quantum information processing trapped particle illustration effect quantum statistic beam splitter investigate non-interacting particle regain result know photon experiment find particle interaction destroy perfect bosonic correlation fermion avoid due exclusion principle hence far less sensitive particle interaction boson behavior explain simple analytic consideration predict certain amount universality verify detailed numerical calculation
