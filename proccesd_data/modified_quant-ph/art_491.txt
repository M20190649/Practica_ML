 unitary dynamic quantum codewords quantum codeword redundant representation logical qubit mean several physical qubits construct way one physical qubits perturb example get entangle unknown environment still enough information encode physical qubits restore logical qubit disentangle environment recovery procedure may consist detection error syndrome follow correction error classical case however also perform mean unitary operation without know error syndrome since quantum codewords span restricted subspace complete physical hilbert space unitary operation generate quantum dynamic computational process subject considerable arbitrariness similar gauge freedom quantum field theory quantum codewords thus serve toy model investigate quantization constrained dynamical system
