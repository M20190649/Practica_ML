 local search method quantum computer local search algorithm use neighborhood relation among search state often perform well variety np-hard combinatorial search problem paper show quantum computer also use neighborhood relation example local quantum search evaluate empirically satisfiability sit problem show particularly effective highly constrain instance problem intermediate number constraint somewhat less effective exploit problem structure incremental quantum method spite much small search space use local method
