 quantum cryptography use large alphabet like quantum information theory quantum cryptography traditionally base two level quantum system letter new protocol quantum key distribution base high dimensional system present experimental realization use interferometric setup also propose analyze protocol practical side one find increased key creation rate keep initial laser pulse rate constant analyze case intercept resend eavesdropping strategy increase error rate find compare two dimensional system hence advantage legitimate user detect eavesdropper
