 optimal encryption quantum bit characterize complete set protocol may use securely encrypt n quantum bit use secret random classical bit addition application quantum encryption protocol quantum data security framework allow generalization many classical cryptographic protocol quantum data show encrypted state give information without secret classical data n random classical bit minimum necessary informationally secure quantum encryption moreover quantum operation show surprising structure canonical inner product space quantum encryption protocol generalization classical one time pad concept connection make quantum encryption quantum teleportation allow new proof optimality teleportation
