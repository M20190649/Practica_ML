 quantum approximate privacy paper study privacy secure function evaluation communication complexity focus quantum version model protocol approximate privacy honest player show privacy loss minimum divulged information compute function decrease exponentially use quantum protocol class privately computable function i.e. privacy loss enlarge quantum protocol quantum communication combine small information leakage hand make certain function computable almost privately computable use either quantum communication without leakage classical communication leakage also give example exponential reduction communication complexity function allow privacy loss instead privacy loss
