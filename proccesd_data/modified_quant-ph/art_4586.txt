 discrimination bell state qudits mean linear optic question discrimination bell state two qudits i.e. d-dimensional quantum system mean passive linear optical element conditional measurement discuss qudit suppose represent optical mode contain exactly one photon altogether recent result calsamiglia follow way distinguish bell state two qudits even probability success low one without auxiliary photon ancillary mode follow result carollo palma prove impossible distinguish even one bell state certainty i.e. probability success equal one irrespective many auxiliary photon involve however show auxiliary photon help discriminate bell state qudits high probability success bell-state analyzer base idea linear optic quantum computation achieve probability success arbitrarily close one describe require many auxiliary photon must first combine entangled state
