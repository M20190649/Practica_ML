 local realist theory parametric conversion series article show parametric-down- conversion process type-i type-ii may describe positive wigner density result together description light detector subtract zeropoint radiation indicate possibility completely local realist theory process present article show down-converted field may describe retarded field generate current inside nonlinear crystal thereby achieve theory prediction coincide standard nonlocal theory however intensity convert signal correspond exactly photon pair nonlocal theory example blue- red conversion would find red photon every blue one theory also predict new phenomenon namely parametric conversion vacuum
