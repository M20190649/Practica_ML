 quantum algorithm collision problem note give quantum algorithm find collision arbitrary r-to-one function n r expect evaluation function assume function give black box efficient best possible classical algorithm even allow probabilism also give similar algorithm find claw pair function furthermore exhibit space-time tradeoff technique approach use grover 's quantum search algorithm novel way
