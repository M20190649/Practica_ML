 lie algebra structure nonlinear controllability spin system paper study controllability property lie algebra structure network particle spin immerse electro-magnetic field relate lie algebra structure property graph whose node represent particle edge connect two node interaction two corresponding particle active network different gyromagnetic ratio provide necessary sufficient condition controllability term property mention graph describe lie algebra structure every case system controllability notion include possibility drive evolution operator state equivalent general network possibly equal gyromagnetic ratio give sufficient condition controllability general form interaction among particle assume include ising heisenberg model special case assume heisenberg interaction provide analysis low dimensional case number particle less equal three include necessary sufficient controllability condition well study lie algebra structure also provide example quantum mechanical system controllability state verify controllability evolution operator
