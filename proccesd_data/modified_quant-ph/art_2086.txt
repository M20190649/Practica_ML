 state estimation large ensemble consider problem estimate state large finite number n identical quantum system limit large n problem simplifies particular relevant measure quality estimation mean quadratic error matrix present bound mean quadratic error new quantum version cram 'er-rao inequality new bound express succinct way quantum case one trade information one parameter information another parameter bound hold arbitrary measurement pure state separable measurement mixed state -- striking example non-locality without entanglement mixed pure state cram 'er-rao bound generally derive assumption estimator unbiased also prove additional regularity condition bound also hold biased estimator finally prove unknown state belong dimensional hilbert space quantum cram 'er-rao bound always attain provide explicit measurement strategy attain bound therefore provide complete solution problem estimate efficiently possible unknown state large ensemble qubits pure state qubits mixed state also provide optimal estimation strategy one consider separable measurement
