 monotonicity quantum linear programming bound powerful technique know present bound size quantum code prescribed minimum distance quantum linear programming bound unlike classical linear program bound immediately obvious quantum linear programming constraint satisfiable dimension k constraint satisfy low dimension show quantum linear programming bound indeed monotonic sense give explicitly monotonic reformulation
