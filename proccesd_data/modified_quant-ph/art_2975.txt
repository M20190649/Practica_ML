 field quantization mean single harmonic oscillator new scheme field quantization propose instead associate different frequency different oscillator begin single oscillator exist superposition different frequency idea apply electromagnetic radiation field use standard dirac-type mode-quantization electromagnetic field obtain several standard property coherent state spontaneous stimulated emission oppose standard approach vacuum energy finite remove ad hoc procedure
