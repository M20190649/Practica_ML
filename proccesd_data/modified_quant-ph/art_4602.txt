 quantum limit cold damp optomechanical couple thermal noise mirror reduce cold damping displacement measure high-finesse cavity control radiation pressure modulated light beam establish general quantum limit noise cold damping mechanism show optomechanical system allow reach limit displacement noise arbitrarily reduce narrow frequency band wide-band analysis show thermal fluctuation reduce classical damp whereas quantum zero-point fluctuation leave unchanged limit cold damping due zero-point energy mirror
