 intuitive hamiltonian quantum search present new intuition behind grover 's quantum search algorithm mean hamiltonian give black-box boolean function f map string length n f w exactly one string w l. k. grover describe quantum algorithm find w n time farhi gutmann show w also find amount time let quantum system evolve accord simple hamiltonian depend f. system evolve along path far take grover 's original algorithm however current paper present equally simple hamiltonian match grover 's algorithm step step new hamiltonian similar appearance farhi gutmann important difference provide new intuition grover 's algorithm intuition contrast supplement explanation grover 's algorithm rotation two dimension suggest hamiltonian-based approach quantum algorithm provide useful heuristic discover new quantum algorithm
