 probabilistic quantum logic operation use polarize beam splitter previously show probabilistic quantum logic operation perform use linear optical element additional photon ancilla post-selection base output single-photon detector describe operation several quantum logic operation elementary nature include quantum parity check quantum encoder show combine implement controlled-not cnot gate gate construct use polarize beam splitter completely transmit one state polarization totally reflect orthogonal state polarization allow simple explanation operation also describe polarizing beam splitter implementation cnot gate closely analogous quantum teleportation technique previously suggest gottesman chuang nature p. finally approach interesting feature make practical use quantum-eraser technique
