 cnot operator similar matrix quantum computation present theoretical result base linear algebra theory similar operator obtained theoretical result optimize experimental technique construct quantum computer e.g. reduce number step perform logical cnot xor operation present theoretical technique also generalize operator quantum computation information theory
