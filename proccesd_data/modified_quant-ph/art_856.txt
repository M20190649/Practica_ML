 operational approach quantum state reduction operational approach quantum state reduction state change measured system cause measurement observable conditional upon outcome measurement found without assume projection postulate stage measuring process whereas conventional formula assume probe measurement satisfy projection postulate new formula determine state reduction show state reduction depend probe observable measure particular depend whether probe measurement satisfy projection postulate contrary longstanding attempt show macroscopic nature probe detection provokes state reduction
