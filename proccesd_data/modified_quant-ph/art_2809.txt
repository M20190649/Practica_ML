 qubit entanglement assist optimal entanglement concentration present two method optimal entanglement concentration pure entangle state local action however prior knowledge schmidt coefficient require first method optimally efficient finite ensemble pure entangle state available whereas second method realize single pair optimal concentration probability also propose entanglement assist method optimally efficient even single pair also discuss concentrate entanglement n-partite cat like state
