 general multimode squeeze state complex multimode bogoliubov transformation obtain general form squeeze operator squeeze state include squeezed vacuum state squeeze coherent state squeeze fock state squeeze coherent fock state general multimode boson system decompose squeezed operator disentangle form normal order simplify expression squeezed state also calculate statistical property s furthermore prove non-degenerate bogoliubov transformation matrix decompose three basic matrix check criterion minimum uncertainty state mu find milburn also prove except special case multimode squeeze state mus original creation annihilation operator rotate properly also discuss special case three basic matrix finally give analytical result two-mode system example
