 ladder operator formalism generally deform oscillator algebraic structure quantum state fock space show various kind one-photon quantum state study field quantum optic admit ladder operator formalism generally deform oscillator algebraic structure two-photon case also consider obtain ladder operator formalism two general state define even odd fock space two-photon state may also generally deform oscillator algebraic structure interesting example one-photon two-photon quantum state give
