 notion controllability quantum mechanical system paper define four different notion controllability physical interest multilevel quantum mechanical system notion involve possibility drive evolution operator well state system establish connection among different notion well method verify controllability paper also contain result relation controllability arbitrary small time system vary compact transformation lie group corresponding system associate homogeneous space application prove system two interact spin particle every state transfer obtain arbitrary small time
