 stability property trap bose-fermi gas mixture stability bose-fermi gas trap isotropic potential ultracold temperature strongly influence interaction fermion boson zero temperature stability criterion give paper use variation method result show whether fermion-boson mixture stable depends mainly interaction fermion boson finite temperature however stability relate coupling constant also temperature stability condition finite temperature also derive discuss detail paper
