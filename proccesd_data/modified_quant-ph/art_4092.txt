 interferometric bell-state preparation use femtosecond-pulse-pumped spontaneous parametric down-conversion present theoretical experimental study prepare maximally entangle two-photon polarization state bell state use femtosecond pulse pump spontaneous parametric down-conversion spdc first show inherent distinguishability femtosecond pulse pump type-ii spdc remove use interferometric technique without spectral amplitude post-selection analyze recently introduce bell state preparation scheme use type-i spdc theoretically method offer result however type-i spdc provide experimentally superior method prepare bell state femtosecond pulse pump spdc pulsed source highly entangle photon pair useful quantum communication quantum cryptography quantum teleportation etc
