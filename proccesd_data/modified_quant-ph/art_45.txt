 quantum cryptography base orthogonal state exist quantum cryptosystems use non-orthogonal state carrier information non-orthogonal state clone duplicate eavesdropper result eavesdropping attempt must introduce error transmission therefore detect legal user communication channel orthogonal state use quantum cryptography since faithfully clone without alter transmit data letter present cryptographic scheme base orthogonal state also assure detection eavesdropper
