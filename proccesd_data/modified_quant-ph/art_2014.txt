 optimal manipulation qubits universal gate problem complement classical bit i.e change value bit vice versa accomplish gate complement qubit unknown state however another matter show operation do perfectly define universal-not u-not gate n identically prepared pure input qubits generate output qubits state close possible perfect complement gate realize classical estimation subsequent re-preparation complement estimate state fidelity therefore equal fidelity f n n optimal estimation depend required number output also show additional priori information state input qubit available fidelity quantum gate much good fidelity estimation
