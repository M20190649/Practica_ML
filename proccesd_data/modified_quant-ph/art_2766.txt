 detection device entanglement-based optical state preparation study use detection device entanglement-based state preparation particular consider optical detection device single-photon sensitivity detector single-photon resolution detector detector cascade emphasis performance realistic detector develop extensive theory use device entanglement-based state preparation perform measurement subsystem therefore need precise bound distinguishability measurement fundamentally different e.g. tomography ensemble identical state use determine probability distribution etc end introduce confidence preparation may also use quantify performance detection device entanglement-based preparation give general expression detector cascade arbitrary size detection two photon show contrary general belief cascade give practical advantage detector single-photon resolution entanglement-based state preparation
