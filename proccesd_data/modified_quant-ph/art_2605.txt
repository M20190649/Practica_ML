 quantitative wave-particle duality non-erasing quantum erasure notion wave-particle duality may quantify inequality v k relate interference fringe visibility v path knowledge k. single-photon interferometer polarization use label path investigate relation various situation include pure mixed partially-mixed input state quantum eraser scheme realize recovers interference fringe even which-way information available erase
