 quantum circuit fanout parity count propose definition qac quantum analog classical class ac constant-depth circuit gate arbitrary fan-in qacc q n-ary mod-q gate also allow show possible make cat state n qubits constant depth construct parity mod- gate constant depth therefore circuit class fan qubit n copy constant depth also include qacc addition prove somewhat surprising result parity fanout allow u construct mod-q gate constant depth q qacc qacc since acc p acc q whenever p q mutually prime qacc strictly powerful classical counterpart qac fanout allow
