 sequence unsharp measurement enable real time visualization quantum oscillation normalized state ket psi c ket c ket single two-level system performs oscillation influence resonant driving field assume one realization process available show possible approximately visualize real time evolution system far give c purpose use sequence particular unsharp measurement separate time specify within theory generalized measurement observables represent positive operator value measure povm realization unsharp measurement may obtain couple two-level system meter perform usual projection measurement meter
