 energy ambiguity nonlinear quantum mechanic observe nonlinear quantum mechanic unlike linear theory exist general difference energy functional define within lagrangian formulation appropriate conserved component canonical energy-momentum tensor energy functional define expectation value corresponding nonlinear hamiltonian operator example ambiguity present particularly simple model known modification however point exist class nonlinear modification schr dinger equation difference occur make consistent manner similar linear schr dinger equation find necessary sufficient condition modification homogeneity modified schr dinger equation underlying lagrangian density assume bilinear '' wave function rather general sense yet particular form density ambiguity question arise salient feature form presence phase functionals present paper thus introduce new class modification characterize desirable rare property
