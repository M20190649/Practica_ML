 numerical experiment capacity quantum channel entangled input state capacity quantum channel product input state formulate quantum cod theorem however whether entangle input state enhance quantum channel still open turn problem reduce aspecial case general problem whether capacity product quantum channel exhibit additivity present study apply one quantum arimoto-blahut type algorithm latter problem result suggest additivity product quantum channel capacity always hold entangle input state enhance quantum channel capacity
