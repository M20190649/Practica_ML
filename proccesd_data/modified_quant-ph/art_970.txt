 nonlinear quantum state transformation spin- non-linear quantum state transformation present transformation operate pair spin- use distinguish optimally two non-orthogonal state similar transformation apply locally component entangled pair spin- use transform mixed nonlocal state quasi-pure maximally entangled singlet state case transformation make use basic building block quantum computer namely quantum-xor gate
