 fault-tolerant quantum computation recently realize use property quantum mechanic might speed certain computation dramatically interest quantum computation since grow one main difficulty realize quantum computation decoherence tend destroy information superposition state quantum computer thus make long computation impossible futher difficulty inaccuracy quantum state transformation throughout computation accumulate render output long computation unreliable previously know quantum circuit gate could tolerate amount inaccuracy decoherence per gate show quantum computation gate build polynomial size quantum circuit tolerate log c amount inaccuracy decoherence per gate constant c. show compute use quantum error correct code code previously know provide resistance error store transmit quantum data
