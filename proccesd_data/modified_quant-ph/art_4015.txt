 bound entanglement continuous variable rare phenomenon discuss notion bound entanglement continuous variable cv show set non -- distillable state nd cv nowhere dense set state i.e. state infinite -- dimensional bipartite system generically distillable automatically imply set separable state entangle state positive partial transpose bound entangle state also nowhere dense set state property significantly distinguish quantum cv system spin like one aspect definition cv also analyse especially context schmidt number theory particular main result generalise mean arbitrary schmidt number single copy regime
