 experimental demonstration greenberger-horne-zeilinger correlation use nuclear magnetic resonance greenberger-horne-zeilinger ghz effect provide example quantum correlation explain classical local hidden variable paper report experimental realization ghz correlation use nuclear magnetic resonance nmr nmr experiment differs originally propose ghz experiment several way perform mixed state rather pure state instead widely separate spin perform locate molecule result nmr version ghz experiment entirely rule classical local hidden variable nonetheless provide unambiguous demonstration paradoxical ghz correlation show classical hidden variable must communicate non-standard previously undetected force nmr demonstration ghz correlation show power nmr quantum information processing technique demonstrate fundamental effect quantum mechanic
