 discrete phase-space calculus quantum spin base reconstruction method use coherent state reconstruct mixed pure quantum state spin possible coherent state density matrix fix probability measure value along appropriately choose direction space thus invert experimental data statistical operator parametrized entirely expectation value basis symbolic calculus quantum spin develop expectation-value representation resemble moyal representation su two important difference exist one hand symbol take value discrete set point phase space hand quasi-probabilities phase-space distribution negative value encounter approach
