 deterministic quantum state transformation derive necessary condition existence completely-positive linear trace-preserving map deterministically transform one finite set pure quantum state another condition also sufficient linearly-independent initial state also examine issue quantum coherence operation maintain purity superposition deterministic transformation one linearly-independent set another even single complete superposition initial state maintain purity initial final state relate unitary transformation
