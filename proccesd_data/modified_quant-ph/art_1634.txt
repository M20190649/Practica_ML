 bound entanglement teleportation recently m. horodecki p. horodecki r. horodecki introduce set density matrix two spin- particle possible distill maximally entangled state even though density matrix entangle thus density matrix allow reliable teleportation however might nevertheless case state use teleportation reliably still fidelity great may achieve classical scheme show least density matrix teleportation achieve good classical fidelity
