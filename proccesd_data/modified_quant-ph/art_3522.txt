 bell 's inequality test entangled atom previous work bell 's inequality realise laboratory use entangled photon describe entangled atom violate bell 's inequality violation measure high detection efficiency first discuss simple scheme base two-level atom inside cavity prepare entangled state discuss scheme use four-level atom require parameter regime much easy access experimentally use current technology oppose scheme proposal rely presence finite decay rate implementation therefore much less demand
