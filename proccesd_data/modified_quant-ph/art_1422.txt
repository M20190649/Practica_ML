 probabilistic cloning identification linearly independent quantum state construct probabilistic quantum clone machine general unitary-reduction operation postselection measurement result machine yield faithful copy input state show state secretly choose certain set leave left psi right leave psi right ... leave psi n right right probabilistically clone leave psi right leave psi right ... leave psi n right linearly-independent derive best possible cloning efficiency probabilistic cloning close connection problem identification set state type n outcome measurement n linearly independent state optimal efficiency type measurement obtain
