 universal simulation markovian quantum dynamic although condition perform arbitrary unitary operation simulate dynamic closed quantum system well understood true general class quantum operation also know superoperators correspond dynamic open quantum system propose framework generation markovian quantum dynamic study resource need universality case single qubit show single nonunitary process necessary sufficient generate unital markovian quantum dynamic whereas set process parametrized one continuous parameter need general also obtain preliminary result unital case high dimension
