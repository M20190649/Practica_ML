 initialization problem quantum compute problem initialize phase quantum compute system consider initialization phase problem system initially present entangled state also application quantum gate transformation since gate introduce phase uncertainty accumulation random phase reduce effectiveness recently propose quantum compute scheme paper also present general observation nonlocal nature quantum error expected performance propose quantum error-correction code base assumption error either bit-flip phase-flip argue code directly solve initialization problem quantum computing
