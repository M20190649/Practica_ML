 invariant quantum algorithm insertion ordered list consider problem insert one item list n- ordered item previously show quantum algorithm could solve problem few log n log log n query n large transform problem translationally invariant problem restrict attention invariant algorithm construct greedy invariant algorithm show numerically outperform best classical algorithm various n. also find invariant algorithm succeed exactly few query classically possible iterate one show insertion problem solve few log n quantum query large n log n classical low bound n't know whether log n algorithm exists
