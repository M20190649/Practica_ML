 privacy amplification quantum key distribution pointwise bound versus average bound order practically useful quantum cryptography must provide guarantee secrecy must provide guarantee useful sufficiently large throughput value standard result generalized privacy amplification yield upper bound average value mutual information available eavesdropper unfortunately result inadequate cryptographic application naive application standard result lead one incorrectly conclude acceptable upper bound mutual information achieve pointwise value bound mutual information associate use specific hash function correspond actual implementation provide fully rigorous mathematical derivation show obtain cryptographically acceptable upper bound actual pointwise value mutual information unlike bound average mutual information value upper bound pointwise mutual information number bit secret key compress specify two different parameter actual realization bound pointwise case necessarily associate specific failure probability constraint amongst parameter effect value system throughput previously analyze show necessary shortening key dictate cryptographically correct pointwise bound still produce viable throughput rate useful practice
