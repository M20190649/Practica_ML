 random quantum correlation density operator distribution consider question statistical ensemble corresponds minimal prior knowledge quantum system case system fact know pure state obvious answer correspond unique unitarily-invariant measure hilbert sphere however problem open general case state describe density operator two approach problem investigate first approach assume system randomly correlate second system ensemble composite system describe random pure state result qubits randomly correlate system present include average entanglement entropy show maximum correlation guarantee limit one system become infinite-dimensional second approach relies choose metric space density operator generate correspond ensemble induced volume element comparison approach make qubits second approach base bures metric yield symmetric hence least informative ensemble density operator
