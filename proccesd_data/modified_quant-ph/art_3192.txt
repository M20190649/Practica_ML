 perturbative expansion master equation applications construct generally applicable small-loss rate expansion density operator open system successive term expansion yield characteristic loss rate dissipation process three application present order give insight context expansion first application two-level atom couple bosonic environment show procedure advantage expansion whereas second application consist single mode field cavity linewidth kappa due partial transmission one mirror illustrate practical use expansion quantum measurement third one atom couple mode lossy cavity show another use perturbative expansion
