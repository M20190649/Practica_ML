 quantum mechanical modeling cnot xor gate consider cnot quantum gate physical action i.e unitary time evolution two-qubit system point modeling interaction hamiltonian two-qubit system would correspond cnot transformation analysis naturally generalize toffoli gate despite nonuniqueness model interaction hamiltonian analysis distinguish interaction hamiltonian posses global rotational symmetry force u conclude direct non-mediated interaction two-qubit system suffice implement cnot gate i.e. able succesfully implement cnot transformation mediator i.e external physical system interact qubits require
