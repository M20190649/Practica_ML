 unified treatment coulomb harmonic oscillator potential dimension quantum mechanical model practical calculation often rely exactly solvable model like coulomb harmonic oscillator potential dimensional generalize coulomb potential contain potential limiting case thus establish continuous link coulomb harmonic oscillator potential various dimension present result necessary utilization potential model practical reference problem quantum mechanical calculation define hilbert space basis generalized coulomb-sturmian basis calculate green 's operator basis also present su algebra associate formulate problem one-dimensional case point complication arise due singularity one-dimensional coulomb problem avoid use generalized coulomb potential
