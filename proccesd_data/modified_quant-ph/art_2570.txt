 bipartite mixed state infinite-dimensional system generically nonseparable give bipartite quantum system represent tensor product two hilbert space give elementary argument show either component space infinite-dimensional set nonseparable density operator trace-norm dense set density operator separable density operator nowhere dense result complement recent detailed investigation separability show component hilbert space finite-dimensional separable neighborhood perhaps small large dimension maximally mixed state
