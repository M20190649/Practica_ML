 q-deformed boson oscillator zero point energy ordinary quantum harmonic oscillator expect zero-point energy play crucial role correct high temperature behavior accordingly reformulate theory statistical distribution function q-deformed boson oscillator develop approximate theory incorporate zero-point energy able demonstrate small deformation theory reproduce correct limit high temperature low temperature deformed theory thus reduce undeformed theory extreme case
