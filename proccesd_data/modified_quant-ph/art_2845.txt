 security aspect practical quantum cryptography use quantum bit qubits cryptography hold promise secure cryptographic quantum key distribution scheme unfortunately implemented scheme totally insecure provide thorough investigation security issue practical quantum key distribution take account channel loss realistic detection process modification qubits '' send sender receiver first show even quantum key distribution perfect qubits achieve long distance fix channel loss fix dark count error take account show exist experimental scheme base weak-pulse '' usually totally insecure finally show parametric downconversion offer enhance performance compare weak coherent pulse counterpart
