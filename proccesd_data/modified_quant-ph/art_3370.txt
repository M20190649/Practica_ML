 hidden variable positive probability despite claim bell 's inequality base einstein locality condition equivalent derivation make identical mathematical assumption local hidden-variable theory produce set positive-definite probability detect particle give spin orientation standard argument quantum mechanic assume particle emit superposition state theory produce set probability examine paper eberhard several similar paper claim show generalize bell inequality chsh inequality derive solely basis locality condition without recourse hide variable point author nonetheless assume set positive-definite probability support claim hidden variable locality issue positive-definite probability demonstrate quantum mechanic predict set probability violate chsh inequality however probability positive-definite nevertheless physically meaningful give usual quantum-mechanical prediction physical situation discuss sense result relate wigner distribution
