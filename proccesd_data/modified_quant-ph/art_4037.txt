 bohmian prediction two double-slit experiment disagreement standard quantum mechanic significance proposal predict different result standard bohmian quantum mechanic subject many discussion year suggest particular experiment two double-slit experiment special detection process call selective detection distinguish two theory use suggested experiment show two theory predict different observable result individual level geometrically symmetric arrangement however prediction ensemble level hand show statistical level use selective detection either prediction two theory differ standard quantum mechanic silent vague bohmian quantum mechanic make explicit prediction
