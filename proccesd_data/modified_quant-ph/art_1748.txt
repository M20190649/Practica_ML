 limitation superposition principle superselection rule non-relativistic quantum mechanic superposition principle basic ingredient quantum theory may come surprise many student even many practitioner quantum craft tha superposition limitation impose certain requirement theory discussion limitation arise so-called superselection rule main purpose paper principal consequence also discuss univalence mass particle number superselection rule non-relativistic quantum mechanic also derive use rather simple method
