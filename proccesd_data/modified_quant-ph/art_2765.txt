 marginal correlation distribution function squeezed-states representation consider husimi function p squeezed state calculate marginal correlation distribution function p project onto photon number state accord value squeezing parameter one verify occurence oscillation beat already appoint literature verify phenomenon entirely contain correlation function particular show since husimi marginal distribution function satisfy partial differential equation squeeze parameter play role time solution squeezed function obtain initial unsqueezed function express mean kernel responsible propagation squeezing calculational point view method present advantage calculate marginal distribution function compare direct integration one two phase-space variable p since one use symmetry property differential equation
