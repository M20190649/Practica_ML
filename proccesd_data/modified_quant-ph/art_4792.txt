 quantum encoding spin system harmonic oscillator show higher-dimensional version qubits qudits encode spin system harmonic oscillator yield important advantage quantum computation whereas qubit-based quantum computation adequate analysis quantum vs classical computation practice qubits often realize higher-dimensional system truncate two level thereby reduce size precious hilbert space develop natural qudit gate universal quantum computation exploit entire accessible hilbert space mathematically give representation generalized pauli group qudits coupled spin system harmonic oscillator include analysis qubit infinite-dimensional limit
