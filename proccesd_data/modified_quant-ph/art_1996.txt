 hide subgroup state almost orthogonal well know quantum computer efficiently find hidden subgroup h finite abelian group g imply polynomial log g number call oracle function state correspond different candidate subgroup exponentially small inner product show true noncommutative group also present quantum algorithm identify hidden subgroup arbitrary finite group g linear log g number call oracle function exponentially good best classical algorithm however quantum algorithm require exponential amount time classical case
