 improve precision measurement casimir force use gold surface report improved precision measurement casimir force use metallic gold surface force measure large gold coat sphere flat plate use atomic force microscope use gold surface remove theoretical uncertainty interpretation measurement force also measure small surface separation complete dielectric spectrum metal use comparison theory experiment average statistical precision remain force measure close separation result lead development strong constraint hypothetical force
