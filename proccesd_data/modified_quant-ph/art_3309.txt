 quantum computer probabilistic inference engine propose new class quantum compute algorithm generalize many standard one goal algorithm estimate probability distribution estimate useful example application decision theory artificial intelligence inference make base uncertain knowledge class algorithm propose base construction method generalize fredkin-toffoli f-t construction method use field classical reversible computing f-t show give binary deterministic circuit one construct another binary deterministic circuit calculation reversible manner show give classical stochastic network classical bayesian net one construct quantum network quantum bayesian net run quantum bayesian net quantum computer one calculate conditional probability one would interested calculate original classical bayesian net thus generalize f-t construction method apply classical stochastic circuit binary deterministic one also show certain situation class algorithm combine grover 's algorithm great advantage
