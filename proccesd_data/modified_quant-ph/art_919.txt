 entanglement measure purification procedure generalize previously propose condition measure entanglement satisfy present class entanglement measure satisfy condition show quantum relative entropy bures metric generate two measure class calculate measure entanglement number mixed two spin system use quantum relative entropy provide efficient numerical method obtain measure entanglement case addition prove number property entanglement measure important physical implication briefly explain statistical basis measure entanglement case quantum relative entropy argue entanglement measure determine upper bound number singlet obtain purification procedure distillable entanglement general small entanglement creation
