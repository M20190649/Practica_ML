 ellipsometric measurement use photon pair generate spontaneous parametric down-conversion present novel interferometric technique perform ellipsometric measurement technique rely use non-classical optical source namely polarization-entangled twin photon generate spontaneous parametric down-conversion nonlinear crystal conjunction coincidence-detection scheme ellipsometric measurement acquire scheme absolute i.e. require source detector calibration
