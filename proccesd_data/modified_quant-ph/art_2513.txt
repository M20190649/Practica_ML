 nonclassical effect driven atoms cavity system presence arbitrary driving field dephasing investigate photon statistic light transmit driven optical cavity contain one two atom interact single mode cavity field treat arbitrary driving field emphasis departure previous weak field result addition effect dephasing due atomic transit cavity mode include use two different model find model show nonclassical correlation quite sensitive dephasing effect multiple atom system dynamic investigate place two atom cavity mode different position therefore different couple strength
