 sophisticated quantum search without entanglement although entanglement widely consider necessary quantum algorithm improve classical one lloyd observe recently grover 's quantum search algorithm implement without entanglement replace multiple particle single particle exponentially many state explain maneuver remove entanglement quantum algorithm physical resource must account quantify algorithm complexity scheme typically incur exponential cost resource particular demonstrate recent experimental realization require exponentially increase precision however quantum algorithm search sophisticated database unlike web search engine single query show require entanglement even multiparticle implementation
