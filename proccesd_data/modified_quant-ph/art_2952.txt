 half quantization general dynamical system compose two coupled sector consider initial time configuration one sector describe set classical data describe standard quantum data dynamical system name half quantum aim paper derive dynamical evolution general half quantum system full quantum formulation standard approach would use quantum mechanic make prediction time evolution half quantum initial data main problem quantum mechanic apply dynamical system whose initial time configuration describe set fully quantum data solution problem present use guideline obtain general formulation couple classical-quantum dynamic finally quantization prescription map give classical theory correspondent half quantum one present
