 complete roughness conductivity correction recent casimir force measurement consider detailed roughness conductivity correction casimir force recent casimir force measurement employ atomic force microscope roughness test bodies-a metal plate sphere- investigate atomic force microscope scanning electron microscope respectively consist separate crystal different height stochastic background amplitude roughness relative zero roughness level determine correction casimir force calculate fourth order small parameter amplitude divide distance two test body also correction due finite conductivity find fourth order relative penetration depth electromagnetic zero point oscillation metal theoretical result configuration sphere plate take account correction excellent agreement measure casimir force
