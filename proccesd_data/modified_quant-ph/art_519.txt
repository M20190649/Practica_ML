 note demkov-ostrovsky nodeless sector briefly tackle following concept demkov-ostrovsky nodeless sector orbital impedance ii orbital capacity iii closeness reflectionlessness moreover use previous supersymmetric result problem strictly isospectral effect orbital impedance discuss explicit plot display maxwell fisheye lens effect though rather small general may apply focusing structure
