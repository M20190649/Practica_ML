 unambiguous discrimination linearly dependent state multiple copy set quantum state unambiguously discriminate linearly independent however linearly dependent set c copy state available result c particle state may form linearly independent set amenable unambiguous discrimination obtain necessary sufficient condition possibility unambiguous discrimination n state give c copy available single copy span dimensional space condition find identical qubits examine detail linearly dependent trine ensemble set c copy state set linearly independent lift trine state maximum unambiguous discrimination probability evaluate c equal priori probability
