 superluminal motion photon particle tunnelings show hartman-fletcher effect valid known expression mean tunnelling time various nonrelativistic approach case finite width barrier without absorption show effect valid tunnelling time mean-square fluctuation basis hartman-fletcher effect know analogy photon nonrelativistic-particle tunnelling one explain superluminal group-velocities observe various photon tunnel experiment without violation so-called einstein causality
