 limitation creation maximal entanglement study limited set optical circuit create near maximal polarisation entanglement em without usual large vacuum contribution optical circuit consider involve passive interferometer feed-forward detection down-converters squeezer input vacuum field find creation maximal entanglement use circuit impossible condition two detected auxiliary photon far experiment auxiliary photon thus base minimum complexity circuit require near maximal polarisation entanglement possible seem unlikely implement experimentally current resource
