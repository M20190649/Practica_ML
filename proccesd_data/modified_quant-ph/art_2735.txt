 high-fidelity teleportation independent qubits quantum teleportation one essential primitive quantum communication suggest quantum teleportation scheme characterize efficiency i.e often succeed teleport fidelity i.e well input state reproduce output insensitivity cross talk i.e well reject input state intend teleport discuss criterion two teleportation experiment independent qubits perform thus far first experiment nature bf qubit state various different polarization state photon fidelity teleportation high pm thus clearly surpass limit principle obtain direct measurement qubit classical communication high fidelity confirm second experiment phys rev lett bf demonstrate entanglement swapping realize teleportation qubit still entangle another one experiment one date demonstrate teleportation genuine unknown quantum state
