 spatial density matrix centre mass one dimensional perfect gas examine reduced density matrix centre mass position basis consider one-dimensional system n non-interacting distinguishable particle infinitely deep square potential well find class pure state system off-diagonal element matrix go zero n increase property hold state vector factorize single particle wave function last case average energy particle less common bound diagonal element distribute accord normal law mean square deviation become small small n increase towards infinity therefore state vector type consider experience spatial superposition centre mass may conclude position preferred basis collective variable
