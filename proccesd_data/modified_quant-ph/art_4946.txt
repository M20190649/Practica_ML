 clone qutrit investigate several class state-dependent quantum cloners three-level system cloners optimally duplicate four maximally-conjugate base equal fidelity thereby extend phase-covariant qubit cloner qutrits three distinct class qutrit cloners distinguish depend two three four maximally-conjugate base clone well latter case simply correspond universal qutrit cloner result apply symmetric well asymmetric cloners balance fidelity two clone also analyze
