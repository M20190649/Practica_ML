 geometric formulation nonlinear quantum mechanic density matrix proposal nonlinear extenstions quantum mechanic discuss two different concept mixed state nonlinear version quantum theory introduce genuine mixture corresponds operational mixing different ensemble ii mixture describe single density matrix without canonical operational possibility pick specific convex decomposition call elementary mixture time evolution class nonlinear extension quantum mechanic introduce evolution elementary mixture generally give evolution component arbitrary convex decomposition theory formulate geometric form consider version hamiltonian mechanic infinite dimensional space density matrix quantum interpretation theory sketch
