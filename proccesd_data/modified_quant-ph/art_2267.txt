 generic bohmian trajectory isolated particle generic bohmian trajectory calculate isolated particle approximate energy eigenstate arbitrary one-dimensional potential well show necessary sufficient condition negligible probability trajectory deviate significantly classical trajectory stage motion state narrowly localise wave packet property bohmian trajectory discuss relationship theory retrodictively optimal simultaneous measurement position momentum present several previous paper show bohmian velocity x expectation value velocity would observe x one make retrodictively optimal simultaneous measurement x p limit error measurement x tends zero explain tendency bohmian particle behave highly non-classical manner also explain trajectory interpretation recently propose garcia de polavieja tend much nearly classical limit large quantum number implication trajectory interpretation consider
