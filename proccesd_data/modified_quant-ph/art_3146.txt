 quantum search continuous variable fast quantum search algorithm continuous variable present result quantum continuous variable analog grover 's algorithm originally propose qubits continuous variable analog hadamard i.e. fourier transform operation use conjunction inversion average quantum state allow approximate identification unknown quantum state way give square-root speed-up search algorithm use classical continuous variable also show quantum search algorithm robust generalised fourier transformation continuous variable
