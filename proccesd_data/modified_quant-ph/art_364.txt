 generalize moyal structure phase space kinetic equation classical limit ii application harmonic oscillator model formalism generalized wigner transformation developped previous paper apply kinetic equation lindblad type quantum harmonic oscillator model first apply oscillator couple equilibrium chain oscillator nearest-neighbour interaction kinetic equation derive without use called rotating-wave approximation show classical limit corresponding phase-space equation independent ordering operator correspond inverse generalized wigner transformation provide latter involutive moreover limit equation conserve probabilistic nature distribution function obey h-theorem coincides kinetic equation corresponding classical system derive independently distinct usually obtain litterature share property finally formalism apply general model equation use quantum optic show result remain unaltered
