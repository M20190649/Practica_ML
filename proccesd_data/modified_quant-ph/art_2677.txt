 spatial correlation diagnostics atom optical lattice explore use first second order same-time atomic spatial correlation function diagnostic probe small scale spatial structure atomic sample trap optical lattice assume ensemble equivalent atom property local wave function give lattice site measure use same-position first-order correlation statistic atomic distribution lattice measure via two-point correlation generally require averaging multiple realization statistically similar distinct realization order obtain sufficient signal noise whereas two-point first order correlation fragile due phase fluctuation shot-to-shot ensemble second order correlation robust perform numerical simulation demonstrate diagnostic tool
