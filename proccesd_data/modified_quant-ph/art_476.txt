 wigner-weyl-moyal formalism algebraic structure first introduce wigner-weyl-moyal formalism theory whose phase-space arbitrary lie algebra also generalize quantum lie algebra supersymmetric theory turn non-commutativity lead deformation classical phase-space instead vector space become manifold topology give commutator relation show fact classical phase-space semi-simple lie algebra become homogenous symplectic manifold symplectic product also deform finally make comment generalize c -algebras operator algebra
