 non-linear property strongly pump laser bloch equation atomic population polarization coherence equation motion photon number laser solve steady state function pump rate two level atom two mode three level atom investigate close threshold usual linear dependence intensity pump rate find case however far threshold strongly nonlinear dependence encounter case pump connect low lasing state one excited state character non-linearity differs crucially case pump relate directly low lasing state non-monotonic dependence laser intensity upon pump rate predict detailed discussion nonlinear behavior present include saturation depletion effect
