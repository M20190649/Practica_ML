 fundamental limit interaction free '' measurement interaction free '' measurement one typically want detect presence object without touch even single photon one often imagine bomb whose trigger extremely sensitive measuring device whose presence would like detect without trigger point measuring device maximum sensitivity set uncertainty principle thus determine whether measurement interaction free '' within finite minimum resolution discuss exactly achieve propose interaction free '' measurement scheme
