 characterisation entanglement-free evolution two quantum system say entangled non-factorisable state joint supposedly pure wave-function expressible product individual wave function instead superposition product state system factorisable state consider separate sense bell show whenever two quantum system interact impossible factorisable state remain factorisable interaction unless full hamiltonian couple system say unless really interact also present certain condition particular factorisable state remain factorisable although represent bipartite system whose component mutually interact pay particular attention case two particle interact mutually action distance three dimensional space
