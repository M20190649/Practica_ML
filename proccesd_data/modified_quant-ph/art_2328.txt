 exactly solvable path integral open cavity term quasinormal mode evaluate finite-temperature euclidean phase-space path integral generate functional scalar field inside leaky cavity provide source confine cavity one first integrate field outside obtain effective action cavity alone subsequently one use expansion cavity field term quasinormal mode qnms -the exact exponentially damp eigenstates classical evolution operator previously show complete large class model dissipation cause effective cavity action nondiagonal qnm basis inversion action matrix inherent gaussian path integral obtain generate functional therefore nontrivial accomplish invoke novel qnm sum rule result consistent obtain previously use canonical quantization
