 information transfer course quantum interaction discuss problem information transfer exchange state configuration two interact quantum system along evolution time consider specific case two mode electromagnetic field rotate wave couple interaction up-conversion nonlinear crystal verify certain initial state field swapping state configuration occur conservation mean energy mode without energy transfer characterise thus pure information flow
