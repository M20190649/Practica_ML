 decoherence within single atom almost diagonal reduced density matrix coordinate representation usually result environment induce decoherence consider sign classical behavior point proton ground state hydrogen atom possess density matrix demonstrate example almost diagonal reduced density matrix may derive interaction low number degree freedom case single electron play role environment also show decoherence effect example observe interaction measuring device significantly faster interaction environment electron opposite case interaction environment significant measurement process coherence restore finally propose neutron scatter experiment cold atoms observe decoherence show additional contribution differential scattering cross section
