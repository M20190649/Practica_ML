 impossibility delete unknown quantum state photon arbitrary polarization state clone perfectly suppose disposal several copy unknown photon possible delete information content one photon physical process specifically two photon initial polarization state mechanism produce one photon initial state standard polarization state do one would create standard blank state onto one could copy unknown state approximately deterministic cloning exactly probabilistic cloning might useful quantum computation one could store new information already compute state delete old information show linearity quantum theory allow u delete copy arbitrary quantum state perfectly though classical computer information delete copy task accomplish quantum information
