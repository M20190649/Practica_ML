 hypergeometric state nonclassical property hypergeometric state one-parameter generalization binomial state single-mode quantized radiation field introduce nonclassical property investigate limit binomial state coherent number state study ladder operator formulation hypergeometric state find algebra involve turn one-parameter deformation su algebra state exhibit highly nonclassical property like sub-poissonian character antibunching squeeze effect quasiprobability distribution phase space namely q wigner function study detail remarkable property seem suggest hypergeometric state deserve attention theoretical applicational side quantum optic
