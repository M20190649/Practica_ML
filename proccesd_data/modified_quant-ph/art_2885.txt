 quantum cryptography use entangled photon energy-time bell state present setup quantum cryptography base photon pair energy-time bell state show feasability laboratory experiment scheme combine advantage use photon pair instead faint laser pulse possibility preserve energy-time entanglement long distance moreover use -dimensional energy-time state fast random change base require setup nature decide whether measure energy time base
