 nonclassical correlation damped quantum soliton use cumulant expansion gaussian approximation internal quantum statistic damped soliton-like pulse kerr medium study numerically consider narrow finite bandwidth spectral pulse component show sub-poissonian statistic enhance certain circumstance absorption damp destructive interference show photon-number correlation correlation photon-number variance different pulse component highly nonclassical even absorbing fiber optimum frequency window determine order realize strong nonclassical behavior offer novel possibility use soliton optical fiber source nonclassically correlate light beam
