 feasible linear-optics generation polarization-entangled photon assist single-photon quantum non-demolition measurement propose feasible scheme create n -party n geq polarization-entangled photon state controllable way scheme require single-photon source single-photon quantum non-demolition measurement sp-qndm simple linear optical element usually high perfection sp-qndm act non-destructive projection measurement onto wanted entangled state filter unwanted term scheme fact realizes entanglement non-interacting photon interaction occur implicitly optical element sp-qndm also briefly consider purification mixed single-photon state within scheme
