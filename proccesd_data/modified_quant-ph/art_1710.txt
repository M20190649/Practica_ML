 quantum fidelity channel capacity show equivalence two different notion quantum channel capacity use entanglement fidelity criterion success transmission use minimum fidelity pure state subspace input hilbert space criterion corollary source entropy rate less capacity may transmit high entanglement fidelity also show restricted class encoding sufficient transmit quantum source may transmit give channel enable u simplify know upper bound channel capacity also enable u show availability auxiliary classical channel encoder decoder increase quantum capacity
