 possible new quantum algorithm arithmetic large integer via chinese remainder theorem residue arithmetic elegant convenient way compute integer exceed natural word size computer algorithm highly parallel hence naturally adapt quantum computation process differs quantum algorithms currently discussion output would presumably obtain classical superposition output many identical quantum system instead arrange constructive interference wave function single quantum computer
