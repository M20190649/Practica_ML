 heisenberg representation quantum computer since shor 's discovery algorithm factor number quantum computer polynomial time quantum computation become subject immense interest unfortunately one key feature quantum computer difficulty describe classical computer also make difficult describe understand precisely do formalism describe evolution operator rather state prove extremely fruitful understand important class quantum operation state use error correction certain communication protocol describe stabilizer group tensor product pauli matrix even simple group structure sufficient allow rich range quantum effect although fall short full power quantum computation
