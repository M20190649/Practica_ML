 real measurement quantum zeno effect mishra sudarshan show unstable particle would never find decayed continuously observe call effect quantum zeno effect paradox later realize frequent measurement could also accelerate decay quantum anti-zeno effect paper investigate quantum zeno effect use definite model measurement take account finite duration finite accuracy measurement general equation jump probability measurement derive find measurement cause inhibition quantum zeno effect acceleration quantum anti-zeno effect evolution depend strength interaction measuring device property system however evolution fully stop
