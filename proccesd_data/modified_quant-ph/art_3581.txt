 quantum compute two-dimensional nmr use spin- transition-selective pulse quantum compute use two-dimensional nmr recently describe use scalar couple evolution technique j. chem phys. present paper describe two-dimensional nmr quantum compute help selective pulse number logic gate implement use two three qubits one extra observer spin many-in-one gate portmanteau gate implement toffoli gate nand gate gate implement three qubits deutsch-jozsa quantum algorithm one two qubits use one extra work qubit also implement use selective pulse create coherent superposition state two-dimensional methodology
