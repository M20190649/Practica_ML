 measure energy estimate hamiltonians time-energy uncertainty relation suppose hamiltonian acting quantum system unknown one want determine hamiltonian show general require time delta obey uncertainty relation delta delta h gtrsim delta h measure accurately unknown hamiltonian must estimate apply result problem measure energy unknown quantum state previously show hamiltonian know energy principle measure arbitrarily short time hand show hamiltonian know energy measurement necessarily take minimum time delta obey uncertainty relation delta delta e gtrsim delta e precision energy measurement several example study address question whether possible saturate uncertainty relation interpretation discuss detail
