 error correction mutually interact qubits simple model mutually interact qubits show error induce mutual interaction eliminate use concatenated coding model solve exactly arbitrary interaction strength two well-known code one two level deep allow one see circumstance error amplitude add coherently incoherently deep concatenation approximate result derived make possible calculate approximate threshold '' value product interaction strength free evolution time failure probability encoded qubit decrease exponentially depth encoding result suggest concatenate coding could fully handle error arise mutual interaction extra cost term resource need would require deal random environmental error
