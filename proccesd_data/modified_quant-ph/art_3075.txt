 quantum computation adiabatic evolution give quantum algorithm solve instance satisfiability problem base adiabatic evolution evolution quantum state govern time-dependent hamiltonian interpolate initial hamiltonian whose ground state easy construct final hamiltonian whose ground state encode satisfying assignment ensure system evolve desire final ground state evolution time must big enough time require depends minimum energy difference two low state interpolating hamiltonian unable estimate gap general give special symmetric case satisfiability problem symmetry allow u estimate gap show case algorithm run polynomial time
