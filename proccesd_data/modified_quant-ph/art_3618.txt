 reply quantum clock synchronization recently protocol quantum clock synchronization qcs remote clock use quantum entanglement propose jozsa et al method goal eliminate random noise present classical synchronization technique however state qcs depend two member entangled pair undergo unitary evolution even transport different location essentially equivalent perfect eddington slow clock transfer protocol thus improvement classical technique discuss suggest way qcs may still use
