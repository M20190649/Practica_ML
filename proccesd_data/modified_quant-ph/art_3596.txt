 continuous optical loading bose-einstein condensate continuous pumping atom bose-einstein condensate via spontaneous emission thermal reservoir analyze consider case atom three-level lambda scheme one atomic transition much short life-time one find scenario photon reabsorption dense cloud consider negligible addition inelastic process neglect find optical pumping use continuously load refill bose-einstein condensate i.e provide possible way achieve continuous atom laser
