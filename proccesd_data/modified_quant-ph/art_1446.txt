 quantum state reconstruction incomplete data knowing guessing two essential epistemological pillar theory quantum-mechanical measurement formulate quantum mechanic statistical theory general priori unknown state completely determine measurement infinite ensemble identically prepared quantum system perform one estimate guess quantum state incomplete data available know reliable estimation base give measure data optimal measurement provide finite number identically prepared quantum object available question address present several scheme reconstruction state quantum system measure data show maximum entropy maxent principle efficiently use estimation quantum state incomplete observation level show bayesian inference use reconstruction quantum state finite number identically prepared system measure describe optimal generalized measurement finite number identically prepared quantum system result estimation quantum state high fidelity
