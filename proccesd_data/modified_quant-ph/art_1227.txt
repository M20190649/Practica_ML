 quantum back-action optical observation bose condensate impressive picture move bose-einstein condensate take use phase-contrast imaging m. r. andrews et al. science calculate quantum backaction measurement technique find phase-contrast imaging quantum nondemolition measurement atomic density instead condensate get gradually deplete rate proportional light intensity inverse cube optical wave length few atom condense high required intensity see picture consequently high induced backaction describe quantum physic phase-contrast imaging put forward new approach quantum-optical propagation develop effective field theory paraxial optic fully quantize atomic medium
