 long-distance quantum communication atomic ensemble linear optic quantum communication hold promise absolutely secure transmission secret message faithful transfer unknown quantum state photonic channel appear attractive physical implementation quantum communication however due loss decoherence channel communication fidelity decrease exponentially channel length describe scheme allow implement robust quantum communication long lossy channel scheme involve laser manipulation atomic ensemble beam splitter single-photon detector moderate efficiency therefore well fit status current experimental technology show communication efficiency scale polynomially channel length thereby facilitate scalability long distance
