 particle theory casimir effect previous work suppes de barros use pure particle model derive interference effect individual photon well-defined trajectory hence wave property present paper extend description account casimir effect consider linear momentum sum frac hbar bf k vacuum state quantum electrodynamics correspond linear momentum virtual photon casimir effect case two parallel plate solid ball explain term pressure cause photon contrary quantum electrodynamics assume finite number virtual photon
