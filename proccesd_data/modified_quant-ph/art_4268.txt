 general polarization matrix electromagnetic radiation general form polarization matrix valid type electromagnetic radiation plane wave multipole radiation etc define term certain bilinear form field-strength tensor quantum counterpart determine operator matrix normal-ordered element respect creation annihilation operator zero-point oscillation zpo polarization define via difference anti-normal normal order operator polarization matrix show zpo multipole field strong describe model plane wave concentrate certain neighborhood local source
