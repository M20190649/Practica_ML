 information capacity formula quantum optical channel application general formula channel capacity develop quantum information theory evaluation information transmission capacity optical channel interesting subject review paper point formulation base classical-quantum channel map model may inadequate one take account power constraint noisy channel define power constraint well explicitly consider quantum state convey transmission channel base consideration calculate capacity formula attenuated noisy optical channel genreral gaussian state input give certain progress beyond example former paper
