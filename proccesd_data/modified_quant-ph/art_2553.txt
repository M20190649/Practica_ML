 quantum communication protocol employ weak measurement propose communication protocol exploit correlation two event definite time-ordering outcome em weak measurement spin b outcome subsequent ordinary measurement spin protocol alice first generate code perform weak measurement sample n spin sample send bob later perform post-selection measure spin along either two certain direction result post-selection define key broadcast publicly use previously generate code key alice able infer em direction choose bob post-selection alternatively alice broadcast publicly code bob able infer code key direction choose alice weak measurement two possible experimental realization protocol briefly mention
