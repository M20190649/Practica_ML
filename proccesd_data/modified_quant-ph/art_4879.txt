 atomic entanglement near realistic microsphere study scheme entangle two-level atom locate close surface dielectric microsphere effect base medium-assisted spontaneous decay rigorously take account dispersive absorptive property microsphere show even weak-coupling regime markov approximation applies entanglement ebit two atom create however large entanglement violation bell 's inequality achieve strong-coupling regime
