 universal teleportation twist give transfer theorem teleportation base twist entanglement measurement allow one say local unitary operation must perform complete teleportation situation generalize scheme include overcomplete measurement non-abelian group local unitary operation e.g. angular momentum teleportation effect non-maximally entangled resource
