 unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment possible bit commitment involve submission evidence one party another evidence use confirm later reveal bit value first party second party determine bit value evidence alone widely believe unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment impossible due quantum entanglement cheating codify general impossibility theorem paper scope general impossibility proof analyze gap find two variant bit commitment scheme utilize anonymous quantum state decoy state present first variant exact verifying measurement independent committed bit value thus second party make first party open make possible unconditional security proof base no-cloning second variant impossibility proof fail quantum entanglement purification mixed state render protocol determinate whether impossibility hold similar protocol open question although preliminary result already show impossibility proof work stand
