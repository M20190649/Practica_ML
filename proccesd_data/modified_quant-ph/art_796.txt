 gamow-jordan vector non-reducible density operator high order s-matrix pole analogy gamow vector obtain first order resonance pole s-matrix one also define high order gamow vector derive high order pole s-matrix s-matrix pole r-th order z r e r-i gamma lead r generalized eigenvectors order k ... r- also jordan vector degree k generalized eigenvalue e r-i gamma gamow-jordan vector element generalized complex eigenvector expansion whose form suggest definition state operator density matrix microphysical decaying state high order pole microphysical state mixture non-reducible component spite fact k-th order gamow-jordan vector polynomial time-dependence one always associate high order pole microphysical state obey purely exponential decay law
