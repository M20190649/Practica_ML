 quantum algorithm measure energy n qubits unknown pair-interactions well-known algorithm quantum phase estimation require consider unitary available conditional transformation depend quantum state ancilla register present algorithm convert unknown n-qubit pair-interaction hamiltonian conditional one standard phase estimation apply measure energy essential assumption consider system bring interaction quantum computer large n algorithm could still applicable estimate density energy state might therefore useful find energy gap solid state
