 generalize one-dimensional point interaction relativistic non-relativistic quantum mechanic first give solution local approximation four parameter family generalized one-dimensional point interaction within framework non-relativistic model three neighbor delta function also discuss problem within relativistic dirac framework give solution three parameter family give physical interpretation so-called epsilon potential also show scattering property high energy substantially differ non-relativistic relativistic case
