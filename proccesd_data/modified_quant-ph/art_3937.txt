 entanglement transformation dielectric four-port device quantum communication scheme widely use dielectric four-port device basic element construct optical quantum channel since causality reason permittivity necessarily complex function frequency dielectric typical example noisy quantum channel quantum coherence preserve base quantization phenomenological electrodynamics construct transformation relate output quantum state input quantum state without place frequency restriction knowledge full transform quantum state enables u compute entanglement contain output quantum state apply formalism typical example quantum communication
