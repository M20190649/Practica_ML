 quantum classical semiclassical analysis photon statistic harmonic generation review compare different description photon-number statistic harmonic generation process within quantum classical semiclassical approach first study exact quantum evolution harmonic generation apply numerical method include hamiltonian diagonalization global characteristic show explicitly harmonic generation indeed serve source nonclassical light demonstrate quasi-stationary sub-poissonian light generate quantum process condition correspond so-called no-energy-transfer regime know classical nonlinear optic apply method classical trajectory demonstrate analytical prediction fano factor good agreement quantum result compare second high harmonic generation no-energy-transfer regime show high noise reduction achieve third-harmonic generation fano-factor third harmonic equal
