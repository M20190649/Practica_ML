 probabilistic quantum clone via greenberger-horne-zeilinger state propose probabilistic quantum clone scheme use greenberger-horne-zeilinger state bell basis measurement single-qubit unitary operation generalized measurement within reach current technology compare another possible scheme via tele-cnot gate d. gottesman i. l. chuang nature present scheme may use experiment clone state one particle two different particle high probability less ghz resource
