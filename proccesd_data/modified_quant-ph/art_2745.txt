 strengthen bell theorem condition falsify local realism experiment two-particle correlation obtain quantum state use bell inequality sinusoidal standard bell inequality use two pair setting whole sinusoidal curve high to-date visibility explicit model reproduce sinusoidal fringe pi conjecture numerical approach present paper high possible visibility local hidden variable model reproduce sinusoidal character quantum prediction two-particle bell-type interference phenomenon sqrt addition approach apply directly experimental data
