 fundamental quantum mutual entropy capacity study mutual entropy information capacity classica l system extensively do shannon several author like kolmogor ov gelfand quantum system several definition mutual entropy classical input quantum output autho r define fully quantum mechanical mutual entropy mean relati entropy umegaki extend general quantum system relative entropy araki uhlmann author introduce quantu mutual entropy indicate contain definition mutual entropy include classical one exist several misu nderstandings use mutual entropy information compute capacity quantum channel therefore note point quantum mutual entropy generalize others isuse occur
