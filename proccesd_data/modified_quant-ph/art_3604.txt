 entropic uncertainty relation power-law wave packet power-law quantum wave packet configuration space variance position observable may divergent accordingly information-entropic formulation uncertainty principle become appropriate heisenberg-type formulation since involve finite quantity find total amount entropic uncertainty converges low bound limit large value exponent
