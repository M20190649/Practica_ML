 source quantum wave due space time dependence wave function time dependent schroedinger equation different boundary condition possible equation usually solve initial value problem '' fix value wave function space give instant compare standard approach source boundary condition '' fix wave time give region particular point one dimension contrast well-known physical interpretation initial-value-problem approach interpretation source approach remain unclear since introduce negative energy component even free motion '' time-dependent norm work provide physical meaning source method find link equivalent initial value problem
