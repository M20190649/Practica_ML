 experimental requirement quantum communication complexity protocols present simple two-party quantum communication complexity protocol high success rate best possible classical protocol task quantum protocol show equivalent quantum non-locality test except necessary close locality loophole derive bound detector efficiency background count rate necessary experimental implementation show close currently achieve use ion trap technology also analyze requirement three-party protocol show less demand two-party protocol result interpret sufficient experimental condition quantum non-locality test use two three entangled qubits
