 lorentz-invariant look quantum clock synchronization protocol base distributed entanglement recent work raise possibility quantum information theory technique use synchronize atomic clock nonlocally one propose algorithm quantum clock synchronization qcs require distribution entangled pure singlet synchronizing party remote entanglement distribution normally create relative phase error distributed singlet state need purify asynchronously present fully relativistic analysis qcs protocol show asynchronous entanglement purification possible therefore propose qcs scheme remain incomplete discuss possible direction research quantum information theory may lead complete work qcs protocol
