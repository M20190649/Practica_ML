 exact diagonalization two quantum model damped harmonic oscillator damped harmonic oscillator workhorse study dissipation quantum mechanic however despite simplicity system give rise approximation whose validity relation refined description deserve thorough investigation work apply method allow u diagonalize exactly dissipative hamiltonians frequently adopt literature use method derive condition validity rotating-wave approximation rwa show approximate description relate general one also show existence dissipative coherent state intimately relate rwa finally evaluation dynamic damped oscillator notice important property dissipative model properly account previous work namely necessity new constraint application factorizable initial condition
