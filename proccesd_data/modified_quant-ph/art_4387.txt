 schroedinger-picture correlation function nonlinear evolution well know interpretational difficulty nonlinear schr odinger von neumann equation reduce problem compute multiple-time correlation function absence heisenberg picture heisenberg picture one often resort zeno-type reason explicitly involve projection postulate mean compute conditional joint probability although method work well linear quantum mechanic completely fail nonlinear evolution propose alternative way perform task linear quantum mechanic show method smoothly extend nonlinear domain trick use appropriate time-dependent hamiltonians involve switching-off function apply technique epr problem nonlinear quantum mechanic show paradox gisin polchinski disappear
