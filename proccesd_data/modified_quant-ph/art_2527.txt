 output spectrum single-atom laser consider laser compose single atom microcavity coherent incoherent pump consider three- four-level gain scheme examine output spectrum laser find linewidth generally scale inverse photon number large atom-field coupling vacuum-rabi doublet structure obtain three-level case vacuum-rabi splitting apparent small intracavity photon number vanishes large pump four-level scheme vacuum-rabi structure appear nonzero pump level maintain large pump even intracavity photon number large unity behavior explain utilize quantum trajectory approach
