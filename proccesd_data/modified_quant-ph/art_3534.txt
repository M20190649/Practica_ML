 two-qubit algorithm involve quantum entanglement phenomenon quantum entanglement fundamental implementation quantum computation require least two qubits demonstration however deutsch algorithm grover 's search algorithm two bit use entanglement develop deutsch-like problem consider possible binary function two bit input distinguish even odd nature quantum algorithm solve problem require entanglement level two qubits final solution suggest nmr implementation problem would lead interesting result
