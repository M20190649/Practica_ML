 accuracy semiclassical method shape invariant potential study accuracy several alternative semiclassical method compute analytically energy level many large class exactly solvable shape invariant potential potential ground state energy compute via wkb method typically deviate exact result recently suggest modification use nonintegral maslov index substantially good supersymmetric wkb quantization method give exact answer energy level
