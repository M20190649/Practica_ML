 rigorous treatment distillable entanglement notion distillable entanglement one fundamental concept quantum information theory unfortunately apparent mismatch intuitive rigorous definition distillable entanglement precise exist rigorous definition impose constraint distilation protocol produce output constant dimension therefore conceivable unnecessary constraint might lead underestimation true distillable entanglement give new definition distillable entanglement remove constraint could conceivably overestimate true value since definition turn equivalent neither underestimation overestimation possible definition arguably correct
