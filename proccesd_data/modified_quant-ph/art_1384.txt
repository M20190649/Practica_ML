 quantum strategy consider game theory perspective quantum algorithm strategy classical game theory either pure deterministic mixed probabilistic introduce basic idea context simple example closely relate traditional matching penny game every two-person zero-sum finite game equilibrium set pure strategy von neumann show always equilibrium player follow mixed strategy mixed strategy deviate equilibrium strategy increase player 's expect payoff show however example player implement quantum strategy increase expect payoff explain relation efficient quantum algorithm prove general quantum strategy always least good classical one furthermore player use quantum strategy need equilibrium allow mixed quantum strategy must
