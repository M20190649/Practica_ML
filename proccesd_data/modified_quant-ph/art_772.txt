 exact quantum polynomial-time algorithm simon 's problem investigate power quantum computer require return answer guarantee correct time upper-bounded polynomial bad case show natural generalization simon 's problem solve way whereas previous algorithm require quantum polynomial time expected sense without upper bound worst-case running time achieve generalize simon 's grover 's algorithm combine novel way follow decision problem solve exact quantum polynomial time would require expect exponential time classical bounded-error probabilistic computer data supply black box
