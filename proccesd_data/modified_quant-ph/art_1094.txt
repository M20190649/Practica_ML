 high power squeeze state jacobi matrix hamburger moment problem k th power amplitude- squeeze state define normalized state give equality schroedinger-robertson uncertainty relation real imaginary part k th power one-mode annihilation operator equivalently set normalized eigenstates possible complex eigenvalue bogolubov transform k th power annihilation operator express number representation eigenvalue equation lead three term recursion relation expansion coefficient explicitly solve case k solution essentially hermite pollaczek polynomial respectively k give ordinary squeezed state i.e displace squeezed vacuum k equal large three explicit solution find recursion relation symmetric operator give real part k th power annihilation operator define jacobi matrix correspond classical hamburger moment problem undetermined imply operator infinity self-adjoint extension disjoint discrete spectrum corresponding squeezed state well-defined however
