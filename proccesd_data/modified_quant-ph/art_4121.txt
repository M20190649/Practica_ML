 nonclassical radiation diamond nanocrystals quantum property fluorescence light emit diamond nanocrystals contain single nitrogen-vacancy nv color center investigate observe photon antibunching low background light system therefore good candidate production single photon demand addition measure large nv center lifetime nanocrystals bulk good agreement simple quantum electrodynamical model
