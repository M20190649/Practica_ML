 pen trap vacuum noise number comment provide rogers 's model experiment measure circular unruh vacuum noise mean hyperbolic penning trap inside microwave cavity suggest cylindrical penning trap geometrically simpler control almost level accuracy hyperbolic trap might good choice experiment besides microwave mode trap known analytical structure directly use try obtain measurable result tiny noise effect
