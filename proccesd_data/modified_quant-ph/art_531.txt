 bosonic quantum code amplitude damp traditional quantum error correction involve redundant encoding k quantum bit use n quantum bit allow detection correction bit error small general code require n k however dominant error process physical system often well know thus invite question give specific error model efficient code devise demonstrate new code correct amplitude damp error allow example k code use effectively n scheme base use bosonic state photon finite number optical mode present necessary sufficient condition code describe construction algorithm physical implementation performance bound
