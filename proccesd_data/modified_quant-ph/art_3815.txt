 bound quantum order search prove exact quantum algorithm search ordered list n element require frac pi ln n query list improve upon previously best know low bound log n proof base weighted all-pairs inner product argument generalize bounded-error quantum algorithm currently best know upper bound exact searching roughly log n give exact quantum algorithm use log n query roughly log n main principle algorithm quantum parallel use classical binary search algorithm method allow basis state superposition communicate
