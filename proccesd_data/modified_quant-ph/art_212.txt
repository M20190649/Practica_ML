 quantum cryptography noisy channel provide complete proof security quantum cryptography eavesdropping attack include coherent measurement even presence noise polarization-based cryptographic scheme show equivalent epr-based scheme also show performance noisy channel approach noiseless one error rate tend zero i.e. secrecy capacity c epsilon c epsilon one implication result one double efficiency well-known quantum cryptographic scheme propose bennett brassard simply assign vastly different probability two conjugate base
