 probability distribution arrival time quantum mechanic previous paper v. delgado j. g. muga phys rev introduce self-adjoint operator hat cal x whose eigenstates use define consistently probability distribution time arrival give spatial point present work show probability distribution previously propose well understood classical ground sense give expectation value certain positive definite operator hat j x nothing straightforward quantum version modulus classical current quantum state highly localize momentum space certain momentum p neq expectation value hat j x become indistinguishable quantum probability current fact may provide justification common practice use latter quantity probability distribution arrival time
