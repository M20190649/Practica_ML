 optimal eavesdropping quantum cryptography consider bennett-brassard cryptographic scheme use two conjugate quantum base eavesdropper attempt obtain information qubits send one base cause disturbance qubits sent basis derive upper bound accessible information one basis give error rate conjugate basis independently fix error rate conjugate base show bound attain simultaneously optimal eavesdropping probe consist two qubits qubits interaction subsequent measurement describe explicitly result combine give expression optimal information eavesdropper obtain give average disturbance interaction measurement perform signal signal finally relation quantum cryptography violation bell 's inequality discuss
