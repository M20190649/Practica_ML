 quantum key distribution rely trusted information center quantum correlation two particle among three particle show nonclassic property use provide secure transmission information paper propose two quantum key distribution scheme quantum cryptographic network use correlation property two three particle one implement greenberger-horne-zeilinger state another implement bell state scheme need trusted information center like classic cryptography optimal efficiency propose protocol high previous scheme
