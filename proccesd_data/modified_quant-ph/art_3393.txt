 schrodinger revisit algebraic approach start quantum liouville equation write density operator product element respectively left right ideal operator algebra find schrodinger picture may express two representation independent algebraic form term density phase operator form respectively continuity equation involve commutator hamiltonian density operator equation time development phase operator involve anti-commutator hamiltonian density operator show latter equation play two important role express conservation energy system energy well define ii provide simple way evaluate gauge change occur aharonov-bohm aharonov-casher berry phase effect operator i.e purely algebraic equation also allow u re-examine bohm interpretation show fact possible construct bohm interpretation representation x-representation discuss meaning bohm interpretation light new result term non-commutative structure enable u clarify relation standard quantum mechanic
