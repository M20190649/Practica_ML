 fault-tolerant quantum computation local gate discuss perform fault-tolerant quantum computation concatenated code use local gate small number dimension show threshold result still exist three two one dimension next-to-nearest-neighbor gate available present explicit construction two three dimension also show nearest-neighbor gate give threshold result case simply demonstrate threshold exists attempt optimize error correction circuit determine exact value threshold additional overhead due fault-tolerance space time polylogarithmic error rate per logical gate
