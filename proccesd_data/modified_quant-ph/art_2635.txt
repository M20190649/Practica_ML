 comparison spectrum determine use detector atom spatial correlation function show two level atom use determine local time dependent spectrum method apply one dimensional cavity spectrum obtain compare mode spectrum determine use spatially filter second order correlation function spectrum obtain use two level atom give identical result mode spectrum one benefit method one time average need also closely relate realistic measurement scheme definition time dependent spectrum
