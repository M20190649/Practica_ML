 non-adiabatically detect geometric phase macroscopic quantum state symmetric squid give simple way detect geometric phase shift conditional geometric phase shift josephson junction system compare previous work falcl g fazio r palma g.m. siewert j verdal v nature bf scheme two advantage use non-adiabatic operation thus detection less affect decoherence also take time evolution zero dynamic phase loop need take extra operation cancel dynamic phase
