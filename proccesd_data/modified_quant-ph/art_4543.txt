 sufficient condition three-particle entanglement test recent experiment point loophole problem recent experimental claim produce three-particle entanglement problem consist question whether mixture two-particle entangle state might suffice explain experimental data attempt close loophole review two sufficient condition distinguish n-particle state n particle entangle state particle entangle n show three recent experiment obtain three-particle entangled state bouwmeester et al. pan et al. rauschenbeutel et al meet condition conclude question whether experiment provide confirmation three-particle entanglement remain unresolved also propose modification experiment would make confirmation feasible
