 franson-type experiment realize two-qubit quantum logic gate quantum computer promise great improvement solve problem factor large integer simulate quantum system database searching use photon quantum bit qubit one promising way realize universal quantum computer coherent superposition state photon robust various source decoherence however difficult realize two-qubit photon gate require huge nonlinearity photon show realization controlled-not cnot gate important elemental two-qubit gate quantum computation extend previous research heart experiment conditional measurement two-photon coincidence franson-type experiment photon count measurement play role nonlinearity require two-qubit gate system reproduce truth table cnot gate furthermore create entangled state superposition state gate clear evidence gate work quantum logic gate result make possible manipulate quantum state photon include entanglement represent significant progress operation various algorithm quantum computation
