 non-local correlation generic infinite-dimensional bipartite system recently show nonseparable density operator bipartite system trace norm dense either factor space infinite dimension show non-local state -- i.e. state whose correlation reproduce local hidden variable model -- also dense construction distinguish case factor space infinite-dimensional show state violate chsh inequality dense case one factor space infinite-dimensional identify open neighborhood nonseparable state violate chsh inequality show state subtle form non-locality often call hidden non-locality remain dense
