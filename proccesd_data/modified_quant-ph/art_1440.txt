 critique protective measurement recently propose idea protective measurement quantum state critically examine generalize earlier criticism idea discuss relevance proposal assess several constraint measure apparatus require protective measurement discuss emphasis may restrict experimental feasibility though protective measurement result unchanged system state shift pointer proportional expectation value measure observable system state actual reading pointer position give rise several subtlety propose several scheme read pointer position apparatus treat classical system well quantum aspect take account address issue tiny entanglement always present due deviation extreme adiabaticity realistic situation argue weak aspect proposal one never perform protective measurement single quantum system absolute certainty clearly preclude ontological status wave function several conceptual issue also discuss
