 quantum particle know time study spatial regularity fundamental solution e x schr odinger equation circle scale besov space although fundamental solution smooth reveal fine change regularity e x different time t. rational e x weighted sum delta-functions therefore exhibit regularity irrational regularity e x well depend well approximate rational badly approximate e.g. quadratic irrational generally bound quotient continued fraction expansion e x -derivative regular e x generic irrational e x almost -derivative regular however good approximate rational low regularity e x describe different thin class irrational prescribe particular regularity fundamental solution class single characterize behavior continued fraction expansion member
