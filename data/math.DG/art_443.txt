Eigenvalue estimates for the Dirac operator depending on the Weyl
  curvature tensor
We prove new lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on
compact manifolds whose Weyl tensor or curvature tensor, respectively, is
divergence free. In the special case of Einstein manifolds, we obtain estimates
depending on the Weyl tensor.
