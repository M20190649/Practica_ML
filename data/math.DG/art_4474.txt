On some directions in the development of jet calculus
Two significant directions in the development of jet calculus are showed.
First, jets are generalized to so-called quasijets. Second, jets of foliated
and multifoliate manifold morphisms are presented. Although the paper has
mainly a survey character, it also includes new results: jets modulo
multifoliations are introduced and its relation to $(R,S,Q)$-jets is
demonstrated.
