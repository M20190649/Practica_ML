A Toponogov type triangle comparison theorem in Finsler geometry
The aim of this article is to establish a Toponogov type triangle comparison
theorem for Finsler manifolds, in the manner of radial curvature geometry. We
consider the situation that the radial flag curvature is bounded below by the
radial curvature function of a non-compact surface of revolution, the edge
opposite to the base point is contained in a Berwald-like region, and that the
Finsler metric is convex enough in the radial directions in that region.
