Extremal domains for the first eigenvalue in a general Riemannian
  manifold
We prove the existence of extremal domains with small prescribed volume for
the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in any compact Riemannian
manifold. This result generalizes a results of F. Pacard and the second author
where the existence of a nondegenerate critical point of the scalar curvature
of the Riemannian manifold was required.
