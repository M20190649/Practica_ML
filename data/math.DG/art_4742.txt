Isometric deformations of minimal surfaces in $S^{4}$
We consider the isometric deformation problem for oriented non simply
connected immersed minimal surfaces $f:M \to S^{4}$. We prove that the space of
all isometric minimal immersions of $M$ into $S^{4}$ with the same normal
curvature function is, within congruences, either finite or a circle.
  Furthermore, we show that for any compact immersed minimal surface in $S^{4}$
with nontrivial normal bundle there are at most finitely many noncongruent
immersed minimal surfaces in $S^{4}$ isometric to it with the same normal
curvature function.
