A Maximum Problem of S.-T. Yau for Variational p-Capacity
Through using the semidiameter (in connection to: the mean radius and surface
radius) of a convex closed hypersurface in $\mathbb R^{n\ge 2}$ as an sharp
upper bound of the variational $(1,n)\ni p$-capacity radius, this paper settles
a restriction/variant of S.-T. Yau's \cite[Problem 59]{Yau} from the surface
area to the variational $p$-capacity whose limit as $p\to 1$ actually induces
the surface area.
