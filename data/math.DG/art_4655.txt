Singularities of Tangent Varieties to Curves and Surfaces
It is given the diffeomorphism classification on generic singularities of
tangent varieties to curves with arbitrary codimension in a projective space.
The generic classifications are performed in terms of certain geometric
structures and differential systems on flag manifolds, via several techniques
in differentiable algebra. It is provided also the generic diffeomorphism
classification of singularities on tangent varieties to contact-integral curves
in the standard contact projective space. Moreover we give basic results on the
classification of singularities of tangent varieties to generic surfaces and
Legendre surfaces.
