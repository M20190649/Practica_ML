Le spectre et la torsion analytique des fibres en droites sur les tores
  complexes
The spectrum of the Laplace-Dolbeault operator for any line bundle with
parallel curvature on a flat complex torus is computed. The Ray-Singer analytic
torsion is then deduced, generalizing thus Bost's result for ample line bundles
and Ray-Singer's ones for flat bundles, of which we a geometric interpretation
is given.
