Differential Harnack Estimates for Time-dependent Heat Equations with
  Potentials
In this paper, we prove a differential Harnack inequality for positive
solutions of time-dependent heat equations with potentials. We also prove a
gradient estimate for the positive solution of the time-dependent heat
equation.
