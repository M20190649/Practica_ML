On Some Characterizations of Ruled Surface of a Closed Spacelike Curve
  with Timelike Binormal in Dual Lorentzian Space
In this paper, we investigate the relations between the pitch, the angle of
pitch and drall of parallel ruled surface of a closed spacelike curve with
timelike binormal in dual Lorentzian space.
