Multitime maximum principle approach of minimal submanifolds and
  harmonic maps
Some optimization problems coming from the Differential Geometry, as for
example, the minimal submanifolds problem and the harmonic maps problem are
solved here via interior solutions of appropriate multitime optimal control
problems.
  Section 1 underlines some science domains where appear multitime optimal
control problems. Section 2 (Section 3) recalls the multitime maximum principle
for optimal control problems with multiple (curvilinear) integral cost
functionals and $m$-flow type constraint evolution. Section 4 shows that there
exists a multitime maximum principle approach of multitime variational
calculus. Section 5 (Section 6) proves that the minimal submanifolds (harmonic
maps) are optimal solutions of multitime evolution PDEs in an appropriate
multitime optimal control problem. Section 7 uses the multitime maximum
principle to show that of all solids having a given surface area, the sphere is
the one having the greatest volume. Section 8 studies the minimal area of a
multitime linear flow as optimal control problem. Section 9 contains
commentaries.
