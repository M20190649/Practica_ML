Locally free sheaves on complex supermanifolds
An important part of the classical theory of real or complex manifolds is the
theory of (smooth, real analytic or complex analytic) vector bundles. With any
vector bundle over a manifold (M,F) the sheaf of its (smooth, real analytic or
complex analytic) sections is associated which is a locally free sheaf of
F-modules, and in this way all the locally free sheaves of F-modules over (M,F)
can be obtained. In the present paper, locally free sheaves of O-modules over a
complex analytic supermanifold (M,O) are studied.
  The main results of the paper are the following ones. Given a locally free
sheaf E of O-modules over a complex analytic supermanifold (M,O), we construct
a locally free sheaf over the retract of (M,O) which is called the retract of
E. Our first result is a classification of locally free sheaves of modules
which have a given retract in terms of non-abelian 1-cohomology. The case of
the tangent sheaf of a split supermanifold is studied in more details. Then we
study locally free sheaves of modules over projective superspaces. A spectral
sequence which connects the cohomology with values in a locally free sheaf of
modules with the cohomology with values in its retract is constructed.
