The X-ray transform on a general family of curves on Finsler surfaces
We consider a general family of curves $\Gamma$ on a compact oriented Finsler
surface $(M,F)$ with boundary $\partial M$. Let $\varphi\in C^{\infty}(M)$ and
$\omega$ a smooth 1-form on $M$. We show that
$$\int_{\gamma(t)}\{\varphi(\gamma(t))+\omega_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t))\}\,dt=0$$
holds for every $\gamma\in\Gamma$ whose endpoints belong to $\partial M$,
$\gamma(a)\in\partial M$, $\gamma(b)\in\partial M$ if and only if $\varphi=0$
and $\omega$ is exact.
  Similar results were proved when $M$ is closed and some additional conditions
on Gaussian curvature are imposed.
  We also study the cohomological equations of Anosov generelized thermostats
on a closed Finsler surface. Finally, we gave conditions when thermostat is of
Anosov type.
