On the Geometry of Connections with Totally Skew-Symmetric Torsion on
  Manifolds with Additional Tensor Structures and Indefinite Metrics
This paper is a survey of results obtained by the authors on the geometry of
connections with totally skew-symmetric torsion on the following manifolds:
almost complex manifolds with Norden metric, almost contact manifolds with
B-metric and almost hypercomplex manifolds with Hermitian and anti-Hermitian
metric.
