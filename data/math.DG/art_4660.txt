Real Hypersurfaces Equipped with $xi$-parallel Structure Jacobi Operator
  in CP^2 or CH^2
We study three dimensional real hypersurfaces in CP^2 and CH^2 equipped with
$xi$-parallel structure Jacobi operator. We prove that they are Hopf
hypersurfaces and if additional $\alpha\neq0$, we classify them.
