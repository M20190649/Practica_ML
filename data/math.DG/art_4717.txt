On the structure of almost Einstein manifolds
In this paper, we study the structure of the limit space of a sequence of
almost Einstein manifolds, which are generalizations of Einstein manifolds.
Roughly speaking, such manifolds are the initial manifolds of some normalized
Ricci flows whose scalar curvatures are almost constants over space-time in the
$L^1$-sense, Ricci curvatures are bounded from below at the initial time. Under
the non-collapsed condition, we show that the limit space of a sequence of
almost Einstein manifolds has most properties which is known for the limit
space of Einstein manifolds. As applications, we can apply our structure
results to study the properties of K\"ahler manifolds.
