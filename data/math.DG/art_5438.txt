spo(2|2)-Equivariant Quantizations on the Supercircle $S^{1|2}$
We consider the space of differential operators $\mathcal{D}_{\lambda\mu}$
acting between $\lambda$- and $\mu$-densities defined on $S^{1|2}$ endowed with
its standard contact structure. This contact structure allows one to define a
filtration on $\mathcal{D}_{\lambda\mu}$ which is finer than the classical one,
obtained by writting a differential operator in terms of the partial
derivatives with respect to the different coordinates. The space
$\mathcal{D}_{\lambda\mu}$ and the associated graded space of symbols
$\mathcal{S}_{\delta}$ ($\delta=\mu-\lambda$) can be considered as
$\mathfrak{spo}(2|2)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{spo}(2|2)$ is the Lie
superalgebra of contact projective vector fields on $S^{1|2}$. We show in this
paper that there is a unique isomorphism of $\mathfrak{spo}(2|2)$-modules
between $\mathcal{S}_{\delta}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\lambda\mu}$ that preserves
the principal symbol (i.e. an $\mathfrak{spo}(2|2)$-equivariant quantization)
for some values of $\delta$ called non-critical values. Moreover, we give an
explicit formula for this isomorphism, extending in this way the results of
[Mellouli N., SIGMA 5 (2009), 111, 11 pages, arXiv:0912.5190] which were
established for second-order differential operators. The method used here to
build the $\mathfrak{spo}(2|2)$-equivariant quantization is the same as the one
used in [Mathonet P., Radoux F., Lett. Math. Phys. 98 (2011), 311-331,
arXiv:1003.3320] to prove the existence of a
$\mathfrak{pgl}(p+1|q)$-equivariant quantization on $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$.
