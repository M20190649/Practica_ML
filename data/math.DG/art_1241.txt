Complete k-curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds 0-modeled
  on an indecomposible symmetric space
For k at least 2, we exhibit complete k-curvature homogeneous neutral
signature pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which are not locally affine homogeneous
(and hence not locally homogeneous). The curvature tensor of these manifolds is
modeled on that of an indecomposible symmetric space. All the local scalar Weyl
curvature invariants of these manifolds vanish.
