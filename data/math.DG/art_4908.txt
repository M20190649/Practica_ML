On extremal function of a modulus of a foliation
We investigate the properties of a modulus of a foliation on a Riemannian
manifold. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an
extremal function and state some of its properties. We obtain the integral
formula which, in a sense, combines the integral over the manifold with
integral over the leaves. We state the relation between an extremal function
and the geometry of distribution orthogonal to a foliation.
