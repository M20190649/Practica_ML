An analytic approach to the stratified Morse inequalities for complex
  cones
In a previous article the author extended the Witten deformation to singular
spaces with cone-like singularities and to a class of Morse functions called
admissible Morse functions. The method applies in particular to complex cones
and stratified Morse functions in the sense of the theory developed by Goresky
and MacPherson. It is well-known from stratified Morse theory that the singular
points of the complex cone contribute to the stratified Morse inequalities in
middle degree only. In this article an analytic proof of this fact is given.
