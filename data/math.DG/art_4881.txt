Dirac and Generalized Complex Structures on Cartan Geometries
We introduce linear Dirac and generalized complex structures on Cartan
geometries and give criteria for Dirac subalgebras of $\frkg\ltimes\frkg^*$
representing Dirac structures on a Cartan geometry. We prove that there is a
bijection between the linear generalized structures on a torsion free Cartan
geometry and the equivariant generalized structures on its corresponding
homogeneous space.
