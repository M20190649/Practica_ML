Quaternionic Salkowski Curves and Quaternionic Similar Curves
In this paper, we give the definitions and characterizations of quaternionic
Salkowski, quaternionic anti-Salkowski and quaternionic similar curves in the
Euclidean spaces E^3 and E^4. We obtain relationships between these curves and
some special quaternionic curves such as quaternionic slant helices and
quaternionic B2-slant helices.
