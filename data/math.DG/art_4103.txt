A partial classification of type I singularities of the mean curvature
  flow in high codimension
The purpose of this article is to examine the possible shapes of type I
singularities that form in the mean curvature flow of submanifolds of arbitrary
codimension, assuming that the initial submanifold satisfies a particular
curvature pinching condition.
