A note on the basic Lichnerowicz cohomology of transversally locally
  conformally KÃ¤hlerian foliations
In this paper we generalize the basic Lichnerowicz cohomology on
transversally locally conformally K\"{a}hlerian foliations and we study its
relation with basic Bott-Chern cohomology and $0$--th basic Dolbeault
cohomology with values in the associated foliated weight bundle.
