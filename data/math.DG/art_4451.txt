Theta-functions on T^2-bundles over T^2 with the Euler class zero
We construct an analogue of the classical theta-function on an Abelian
variety for closed 4-dimensional symplectic manifolds which are T^2-bundles
over T^2 with the zero Euler class. We use our theta-functions for a canonical
symplectic embedding of these manifolds into complex projective spaces (an
analogue of the Lefschetz theorem).
