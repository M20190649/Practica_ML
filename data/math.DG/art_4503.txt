An affine characterization of quadratic curves
By analyzing the affine Taylor expansion of a non-degenerate plane curve, we
obtain characterizations of classes of such curves via curvature properties of
the gravity curve. The proof is based on an analysis of the degree parity and
leading coefficients of polynomials occurring in the expansion.
