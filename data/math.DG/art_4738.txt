Stable Configurations of repelling Points on compact Manifolds
This is an expanded version of [arXiv:1107.4836v1 [math.DS]]. Using
techniques from [Chapter XI, The Selberg Trace Formula, in Eigenvalues in
Riemannian Geometry, by Isaac Chavel], in which a differential-geometrically
intrinsic treatment of counterparts of classical electrostatics was introduced,
it is shown that on some compact manifolds, certain stable configurations of
points which mutually repel along all interconnecting geodesics become
equidistributed as the number of points increases.
