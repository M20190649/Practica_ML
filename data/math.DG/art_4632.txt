Penrose transform and monogenic functions
Penrose transform tells us that there is an isomorphism of the kernel of an
invariant differential operator studied in the paper [TS] and sheaf cohomology
of some vector bundle on twistor space. The point of this paper is to write
down this isomorphism explicitly. Explicit form of the isomorphism will be
crucial for further investigation on the properties of the complex.
