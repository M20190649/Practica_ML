The Spectral Geometry of the Riemann Curvature Operator in the Higher
  Signature Setting
We study the spectral geometry of the Riemann curvature tensor for
Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and provide some examples illustrating the
phenomena which can arise in the higher signature setting.
  Dedication: This paper is dedicated to the memory of our colleague Prof.G.
Tsagas who studied the spectral geometry of Laplacian.
