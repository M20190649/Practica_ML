Flat Rotational Surface with Pointwise 1-typeGauss map in E4
In this paper we study general rotational surfaces in the 4- dimensional
Euclidean space E4 and give a characterization of flat general rotation surface
with pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Also, we show that a non-planar flat general
rotation surface with pointwise 1-type Gauss map is a Lie group if and only if
it is a Clifford torus.
