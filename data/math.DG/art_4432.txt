Curvature properties on some classes of almost contact manifolds with
  B-metric
Almost contact manifolds with B-metric are considered. Of special interest
are the so-called vertical classes of the almost contact B-metric manifolds.
Curvature properties of these manifolds are studied. An example of
5-dimensional manifolds is constructed and characterized.
