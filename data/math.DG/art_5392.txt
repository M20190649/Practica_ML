Generalized symplectic symmetric spaces
Bielavsky introduced and investigated the class of symmetric symplectic
spaces, that is, symmetric spaces endowed with a symplectic form invariant with
respect to symmetries. Since the theory of symmetric spaces has
generalizations, we ask a question about their possible symplectic versions. We
do construct such generalizations and extend some of Bieliavsky's results. In
particular, we classify all 3-symmetric symplectic spaces.
