C^1-regularity for local graph representations of immersions
We consider immersions admitting uniform graph representations over the
affine tangent space over a ball of fixed radius r>0. We show that for
sufficiently small C^0-norm of the graph functions, each graph function is
smooth with small C^1-norm.
