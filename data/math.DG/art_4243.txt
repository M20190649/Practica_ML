On osp(p+1,q+1|2r)-equivariant quantizations
We investigate the concept of equivariant quantization over the superspace
R^{p+q|2r}, with respect to the orthosymplectic algebra osp(p+1,q+1|2r). Our
methods and results vary upon the superdimension p+q-2r. When the
superdimension is nonzero, we manage to obtain a result which is similar to the
classical theorem of Duval, Lecomte and Ovsienko: we prove the existence and
uniqueness of the equivariant quantization except in some resonant situations.
To do so, we have to adapt their methods to take into account the fact that the
Casimir operator of the orthosymplectic algebra on supersymmetric tensors is
not always diagonalizable, when the superdimension is negative and even. When
the superdimension is zero, the situation is always resonant, but we can show
the existence of a one-parameter family of equivariant quantizations for
symbols of degree at most two.
