Dirac-Hestenes spinors and Weierstrass representation for surfaces in 4D
  complex space
Representations of Dirac-Hestenes and Dirac spinor fields via coordinates of
surfaces conformally immersed into 4-dimensional complex space are proposed. A
relation between time evolution of spinor fields and integrable deformations of
surfaces is discussed.
