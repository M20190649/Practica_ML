Bach-flat gradient steady Ricci solitons
In this paper we prove that any $n$-dimensional ($n\ge 4$) complete Bach-flat
gradient steady Ricci soliton with positive Ricci curvature is isometric to the
Bryant soliton. We also show that a three-dimensional gradient steady Ricci
soliton with divergence-free Bach tensor is either flat or isometric to the
Bryant soliton. In particular, these results improve the corresponding
classification theorems for complete locally conformally flat gradient steady
Ricci solitons in [6] and [9].
