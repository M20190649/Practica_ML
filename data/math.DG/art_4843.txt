Spectral geometry of $eta$-Einstein Sasakian manifolds
We extend a result of Patodi for closed Riemannian manifolds to the context
of closed contact manifolds by showing the condition that a manifold is an
$\eta$-Einstein Sasakian manifold is spectrally determined. We also prove that
the condition that a Sasakian space form has constant $\phi$-sectional
curvature $c$ is spectrally determined.
