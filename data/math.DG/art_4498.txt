Some comparison results on equivalence groups
This paper deals with the comparison of two common types of equivalence
groups of differential equations, and this gives rise to a number of results
presented in the form of theorems. It is shown in particular that one type can
be identified with a subgroup of the other type. Consequences of this
comparison related in particular to the determination of invariant functions of
the differential equations are also discussed.
