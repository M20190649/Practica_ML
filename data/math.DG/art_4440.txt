Hermitian structures on the product of Sasakian manifolds
We investigate the curvature properties of a two-parameter family of
Hermitian structures on the product of two Sasakian manifolds, as well as
intermediate relations. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a
Hermitian structure belonging to the family to be Einstein and provide concrete
examples.
