The Canonical Expanding Soliton and Harnack inequalities for Ricci flow
We introduce the notion of Canonical Expanding Ricci Soliton, and use it to
derive new Harnack inequalities for Ricci flow. This viewpoint also gives
geometric insight into the existing Harnack inequalities of Hamilton and
Brendle.
