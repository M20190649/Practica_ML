Conformal immersions of prescribed mean curvature in R^3
We prove the existence of (branched) conformal immersions F: S^2 -> R^3 with
mean curvature H > 0 arbitrarily prescribed up to a 3-dimensional affine
indeterminacy. A similar result is proved for the space forms S^3, H^3 and
partial results for surfaces of higher genus.
