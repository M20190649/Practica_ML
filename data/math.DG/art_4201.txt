3-submersions from QR-hypersurfaces of quaternionic Kaehler manifolds
In this paper we study 3-submersions from a QR-hypersurface of a quaternionic
Kaehler manifold onto an almost quaternionic hermitian manifold. We also prove
the non-existence of quaternionic submersions between quaternionic Kaehler
manifolds which are not locally hyper-Kaehler.
