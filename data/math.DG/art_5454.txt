The geometry of barotropic flow
In this article we write the equations of barotropic compressible fluid
mechanics as a geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional manifold. The
equations are given by \begin{align} u_t + \nabla_uu = -\frac{1}{\rho} \grad p
\\ \rho_t + \diver{(\rho u)} = 0, \end{align} where the fluid fills up a
compact manifold $M$, $u$ is a time-dependent velocity field on $M$, and $\rho$
is the density, a positive function on $M$. The barotropic assumption is that
the pressure $p$ is some given function of the density, although our methods
also extend to certain more general isentropic flows. Our infinite-dimensional
manifold is the product $\mathcal{D}(M)\times C^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$. This
is a group using the semidirect product (which is sometimes incorporated in
other treatments), but the Riemannian metric we use is neither left- nor
right-invariant. Hence our geodesic equation is \emph{not} an Euler-Arnold
equation. We compute the sectional curvature and show that at least when
$M=S^1$, the curvature is always nonnegative. We also establish some results on
the Lagrangian linear stability of solutions of this system, for certain
nonsteady solutions in one dimension and steady solutions in two dimensions.
