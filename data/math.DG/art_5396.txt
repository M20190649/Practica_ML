Almost Paracontact Finsler Structures on Vector Bundle
In this paper, we define almost paracontact and normal almost paracontact
Finsler structures on a vector bundle and find some conditions for
integrability of these structures. We define paracontact metric, para- Sasakian
and K-paracontact Finsler structures and study some properties of these
structures. For a K-paracontact Finsler structure, we find the vertical and
horizontal flag curvatures. Then, we define vertical ?-flag curvature and prove
that every locally symmetric para-Sasakian Finsler structure has negative
vertical ?-flag curvature. Finally, we define the horizontal and vertical Ricci
tensors of a para-Sasakian Finsler structure and study some curvature
properties of them.
