A note on Canonical Ricci forms on 2-step nilmanifolds
In this note we prove that any left-invariant almost Hermitian structure on a
2-step nilmanifold is Ricci-flat with respect to the Chern connection and that
it is Ricci-flat with respect to another canonical connection if and only if it
is cosymplectic.
