Transversal Surfaces of Timelike Ruled Surfaces in Minkowski 3-Space
In this study we give definitions and characterizations of transversal
surfaces of timelike ruled surfaces. We study some special cases such as the
striction curve is a geodesic, an asymptotic line or a line of curvature.
Moreover, we obtain developable conditions for transversal surfaces of a
timelike ruled surface.
