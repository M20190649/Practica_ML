On existence of invariant Einstein metrics on a compact homogeneous
  space
We prove that the existence of a positively defined, invariant Einstein
metric $m$ on a connected homogeneous space $G/H$ of a compact Lie group $G$ is
the consequence of non-contractibility of some compact set $C=X_{G,H}^{\Sigma}$
(B\"ohm polyhedron) introduced by C.B\"ohm. There is a natural continuous map
of $C$ onto the flag complex $K_B$ of a finite graph $B$. The special case of
$C = K_B$, $K_B$ non-contractible, is one of B\"ohm existence criteria, and the
case of the graph $B$ non-connected is a improved version of the Graph Theorem
(C.B\"ohm, M.Wang, and W.Ziller) actual for any $\mathfrak {z(g)}$. Moreover,
preparation theorems of C. B\"ohm on retractions are revisited and new
constructions of some topologic spaces are suggested.
