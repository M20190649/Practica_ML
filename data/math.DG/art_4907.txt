A fourth order family of minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere
This is a preliminary note on a family of minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere
defined by a compatible fourth order equation. The minimal surfaces are
geometrically characterized either by having a surface of revolution like
induced metric, or by having a flat structure 3-web. We observe that the
structure equation un-couples for a natural choice of frame. The analysis is
reduced to the associated curves in the 2-sphere defined by a rational third
order ODE on the curvature.
