Subtleties Concerning Conformal Tractor Bundles
The realization of tractor bundles as associated bundles in conformal
geometry is studied. It is shown that different natural choices of principal
bundle with normal Cartan connection corresponding to a given conformal
manifold can give rise to topologically distinct associated tractor bundles for
the same inducing representation. Consequences for homogeneous models and
conformal holonomy are described. A careful presentation is made of background
material concerning standard tractor bundles and equivalence between parabolic
geometries and underlying structures.
