Spectral and stochastic properties of the $f$-Laplacian, solutions of
  PDE's at infinity, and geometric applications
The aim of this paper is to suggest a new viewpoint to study qualitative
properties of solutions of semilinear elliptic PDE's defined outside a compact
set. The relevant tools come from spectral theory and from a combination of
stochastic properties of the relevant differential operators. Possible links
between spectral and stochastic properties are analyzed in detail.
