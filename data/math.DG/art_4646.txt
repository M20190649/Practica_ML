Remarks on global geodesic properties of GÃ¶del type spacetimes
The aim of this paper is to review and complete the study of geodesics on
G\"odel type spacetimes initiated in [8] and improved in [2] of the References.
In particular, we prove some new results on geodesic connectedness and geodesic
completeness for these spacetimes.
