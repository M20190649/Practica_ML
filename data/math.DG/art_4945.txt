Approximations of periodic functions to R^n by curvatures of closed
  curves
We show that for any n real periodic functions f_1,..., f_n with the same
period, such that f_i>0 for i<n, and a real number e >0, there is a closed
curve in R^{n+1} with curvatures k_1, ..., k_n such that |k_i(t)-f_i(t)| < e
for all i and t. This neither holds for closed curves in the hyperbolic space
H^{n+1}, nor for parametric families of closed curves in R^{n+1}.
