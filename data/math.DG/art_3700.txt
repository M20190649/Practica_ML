On Some Characterizations of Ruled Surface of a Closed Spacelike Curve
  with a Spacelike Binormal in Dual Lorentzian Space
In this paper, we investigate the relations between the pitch, the angle of
pitch and drall of parallel ruled surface of a closed spacelike curve with a
spacelike binormal in dual Lorentzian space.
