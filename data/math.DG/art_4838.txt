A Sharp Comparison Theorem for Compact Manifolds with Mean Convex
  Boundary
Let $M$ be a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonnegative
Ricci curvature and mean convex boundary $\partial M$. Assume that the mean
curvature $H$ of the boundary $\partial M$ satisfies $H \geq (n-1) k >0$ for
some positive constant $k$. In this paper, we prove that the distance function
$d$ to the boundary $\partial M$ is bounded from above by $\frac{1}{k}$ and the
upper bound is achieved if and only if $M$ is isometric to an $n$-dimensional
Euclidean ball of radius $\frac{1}{k}$.
