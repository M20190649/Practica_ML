Mod $p$ vanishing theorem of Seiberg-Witten invariants for 4-manifolds
  with $Z_p$-actions
We give an alternative proof of the mod $p$ vanishing theorem by F.Fang of
Seiberg-Witten invariants under a cyclic group action of prime order, and
generalize it to the case when $b_1>0$. Although we also use the finite
dimensional approximation of the monopole map as well as Fang, our method is
rather geometric. Furthermore, non-trivial examples of mod $p$ vanishing are
given.
