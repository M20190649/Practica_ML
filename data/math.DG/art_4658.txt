Biminimal properly immersed submanifolds in the Euclidean spaces
We consider a complete nonnegative biminimal submanifold M (that is, a
complete biminimal submanifold with lambda>=0) in a Euclidean space E^N. Assume
that the immersion is proper, that is, the preimage of every compact set in E^N
is also compact in M. Then, we prove that M is minimal. From this result, we
give an affirmative partial answer to Chen's conjecture. For the case of
lambda<0, we construct examples of biminimal submanifolds and curves.
