The topology of the set of nonsoliton Lie algebras in the moduli space
  of nilpotent Lie algebras
A Lie algebra is called nonsoliton if it does not admit a soliton inner
product. We demonstrate that the subset of nonsoliton Lie algebras in the
moduli space of indecomposable n-dimensional N-graded nilpotent Lie algebras is
discrete if and only if n <= 7.
