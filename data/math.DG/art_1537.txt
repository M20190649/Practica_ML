Kaehler-Ricci solitons on homogeneous toric bundles (I)
This is the first of a sequence of two papers. Here, a simple algebraic
characterization of the Fano manifolds in the class of homogeneous toric
bundles over a flag manifold G^C/P is provided in terms of symplectic data. The
result of this paper is used in the second paper, where it is proved that an
homogeneous toric bundle over a flag manifold admits a Kaehler-Ricci solitonic
metric if and only if it is Fano.
