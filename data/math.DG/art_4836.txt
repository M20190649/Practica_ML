Mod r Vanishing Theorem of Seiberg-Witten Invariant for 4-Manifolds
  acted by Cyclic Group Z_r
In this paper, a vanishing theorem is stated and proved. If a 4-manifold $M$
admits a smooth action by a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_r$, then given an
$\mathbb{Z}_r$-equivariant $Spin^c$-structure $\mathcal{C}$ on $M$, the
Seiberg-Witten invariant $SW\mathcal{(C)}$ is zero modulo $r$ under some slight
assumptions. Here $r$ can be any positive integer. This theorem is a
generalization of the mod p vanishing theorem when $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is prime
order cyclic proved by F.Fang.
