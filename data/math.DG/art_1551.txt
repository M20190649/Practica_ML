Totally umbilic surfaces in homogeneous 3-manifolds
We discuss existence and classification of totally umbilic surfaces in the
model geometries of Thurston and the Berger spheres. We classify such surfaces
in $H^2 \times R$, $S^2 \times R$ and the Sol group. We prove nonexistence in
the Berger spheres and in the remaining model geometries other than the space
forms.
