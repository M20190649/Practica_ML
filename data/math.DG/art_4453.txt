Warped product rigidity
In this paper we study the space of solutions to an overdetermined linear
system involving the Hessian of functions. We show that if the solution space
has dimension greater than one, then the underlying manifold has a very rigid
warped product structure. We obtain a uniqueness result for prescribing the
Ricci curvature of a warped product manifold over a fixed base. As an
application, this warped product structure will be used to study warped product
Einstein structures in "Uniqueness of warped product Einstein metrics and
applications".
