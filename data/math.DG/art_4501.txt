Reduction of Homogeneous Riemannian Structures
The goal of this article is the study of homogeneous Riemannian structure
tensors within the framework of reduction under a group $H$ of isometries. In a
first result, $H$ is a normal subgroup of the group of symmetries associated to
the reducing tensor $\bar{S}$. The situation when $H$ is any group acting
freely is analyzed in a second result. The invariant classes of homogeneous
tensors are also investigated when reduction is performed. It turns out that
the geometry of the fibres is involved in the preservation of some of them.
Some classical examples illustrate the theory. Finally, the reduction procedure
is applied to fiberings of almost contact manifolds over almost Hermitian
manifolds. If the structure is moreover Sasakian, the obtained reduced tensor
is homogeneous K\"ahler.
