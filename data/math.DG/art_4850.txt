Spherical Indicatrices of Involute of a Space Curve in Euclidean 3-Space
In this work, we studied the properties of the spherical indicatrices of
involute curve of a space curve and presented some characteristic properties in
the cases that involute curve and evolute curve are slant helices and helices,
spherical indicatrices are slant helices and helices and we introduced new
representations of spherical indicatrices.
