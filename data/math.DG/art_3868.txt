On the manifold structure of the set of unparameterized embeddings with
  low regularity
Given manifolds $M$ and $N$, with $M$ compact, we study the geometrical
structure of the space of embeddings of $M$ into $N$, having less regularity
than $\mathcal C^\infty$, quotiented by the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$.
