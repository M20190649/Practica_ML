Differential Geometry of Microlinear Frolicher Spaces IV-2
This paper is the sequel to our previous paper (Differetial Geometry of
Microlinear Frolicher spaces IV-1), where three approaches to jet bundles are
presented and compared. The first objective in this paper is to give the affine
bundle theorem for the second and third approaches to jet bundles. The second
objective is to deal with the three approaches to jet bundles in the context
where coordinates are available. In this context all the three approaches are
shown to be equivalent.
