Topology of KÃ¤hler manifolds with weakly pseudoconvex boundary
We study Kahler manifolds-with-boundary, not necessarily compact, with weakly
pseudoconvex boundary, each component of which is compact. If such a manifold
$K$ has $l\ge2$ boundary components (possibly $l=\infty$), then it has first
betti number at least $l-1$, and the Levi form of any boundary component is
zero. If $K$ has $l\ge1$ pseudoconvex boundary components and at least one
non-parabolic end, the first betti number of $K$ is at least $l$. In either
case, any boundary component has non-vanishing first betti number. If $K$ has
one pseudoconvex boundary component with vanishing first betti number, the
first betti number of $K$ is also zero. Especially significant are applications
to Kahler ALE manifolds, and to Kahler 4-manifolds. This significantly extends
prior results in this direction (eg. Kohn-Rossi), and uses substantially
simpler methods.
