Assembling Lie Algebras from Lieons
If a Lie algebra structures $\gG$ on a vector space is the sum of a family of
mutually compatible Lie algebra structures $\gG_i$, we say that $\gG$ is
\emph{simply assembled} from $\gG_s$'s. By repeating this procedure several
times one gets a family of Lie algebras \emph{assembled} from $\gG_s$'s. The
central result of this paper is that any finite dimensional Lie algebra over
$\R$ or $\C$ can be assembled from two constituents, called $\between$- and
$\pitchfork$-\emph{lieons}. A lieon is the direct sum of an abelian Lie algebra
with a 2-dmensional nonabelian Lie algebra or with the 3-dimensional Heisenberg
algebra.
  Some techniques of disassembling Lie algebras are introduced and various
results concerning assembling-disassembling procedures are obtained. In
particular, it is shown how classical Lie algebras are assembled from lieons
and is obtained the complete list of Lie algebras, which can be simply
assembled from lieons.
