Geometry of curves in parabolic homogeneous spaces
The current paper is devoted to the study of integral curves of constant type
in parabolic homogeneous spaces. We construct a canonical moving frame bundle
for such curves and give the criterium when it turns out to be a Cartan
connection. Generalizations to parametrized curves, to higher-dimensional
submanifolds and to general parabolic geometries are discussed.
