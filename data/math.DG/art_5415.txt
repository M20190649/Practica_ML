The classification of totally umbilical surfaces in homogeneous
  3-manifolds
We obtain an exhaustive classification of totally umbilical surfaces in
unimodular and non-unimodular simply-connected 3-dimensional Lie groups endowed
with arbitrary left-invariant Riemannian metrics. This completes the
classification of totally umbilical surfaces in homogeneous Riemannian
3-manifolds.
