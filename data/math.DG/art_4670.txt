G-set Theory and Applications in Lie Theory
This paper is devoted to the development and applications of some (new) basic
concepts in Lie theory, both from `computational" and "observability"
viewpoint. We specify set of all "G-equivariant" maps from a given Lie group G
to the underlying manifold M, namely $G$-set, and also we introduce "conjugacy"
in Lie group theory. The next goal of this paper is detailed analysis of the
G-sets in connection with underlying transformation groups and providing a
rigorous theoretical justification of "G-sets", when a group of transformations
G acts on manifold M.
