Almost hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds and a 4-dimensional Lie
  group with such structure
Almost hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds are considered. Isotropic
hyper-K\"ahler manifolds are introduced. A 4-parametric family of 4-dimensional
manifolds of this type is constructed on a Lie group. This family is
characterized geometrically. The condition a 4-manifold to be isotropic
hyper-K\"ahler is given.
