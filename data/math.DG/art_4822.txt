Integral estimates for the trace of symmetric operators
Let $\Phi:TM\to TM$ be a positive-semidefinite symmetric operator of class
$C^1$ defined on a complete non-compact manifold $M$ isometrically immersed in
a Hadamard space $\bar{M}$. In this paper, we given conditions on the operator
$\Phi$ and on the second fundamental form to guarantee that either $\Phi\equiv
0$ or the integral $\int_M \mathrm{tr}\,\Phi dM$ is infinite. We will given
some applications. The first one says that if $M$ admits an integrable
distribution whose integrals are minimal submanifolds in $\bar{M}$ then the
volume of $M$ must be infinite. Another application states that if the
sectional curvature of $\bar{M}$ satisfies $\bar{K}\leq -c^2$, for some $c\geq
0$, and $\lambda:M^m\to [0,\infty)$ is a nonnegative $C^1$ function such that
gradient vector of $\lambda$ and the mean curvature vector $H$ of the immersion
satisfy $|H+p\nabla \lambda|\leq (m-1)c \lambda$, for some $p\geq 1$, then
either $\lambda\equiv 0$ or the integral $\int_M \lambda^s dM$ is infinite, for
all $1\leq s\leq p$.
