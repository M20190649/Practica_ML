The complete system of differential invariants of a curve in
  pseudo-euclidean space
A complete system of differential invariants for equivalence of curves in the
$n$-dimensional pseudo-euclidean space with respect to the action of each of
the groups $K^n \lhd O(n,p,K)$, $K^n \lhd SO(n,p,K)$, $O(n,p,K)$, and
$SO(n,p,K)$, where $K = \mathbf{R}$, or $K = \mathbf{C}$, and $O(n,p,K)$
$\bigl($respectively, $SO(n,p,K)\big)$ are a pseudo-orthogonal (special
pseudo-orthogonal) groups, is given.
