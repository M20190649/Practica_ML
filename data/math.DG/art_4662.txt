A construction of Spin(7)-instantons
Joyce constructed examples of compact eight-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7),
starting with a Calabi-Yau four-orbifold with isolated singular points of a
special kind. That construction can be seen as the gluing of ALE
Spin(7)-manifolds to each singular point of the Calabi-Yau four-orbifold
divided by an anti-holomorphic involution fixing only the singular points.
  On the other hand, there are higher-dimensional analogues of anti-self-dual
instantons in four dimensions on Spin(7)-manifolds, which are called
Spin(7)-instantons. They are minimizers of the Yang-Mills action, and the
Spin(7)-instanton equation together with a gauge fixing condition forms an
elliptic system.
  In this article, we construct Spin(7)-instantons on the examples of compact
Spin(7)-manifolds above, starting with Hermitian-Einstein connections on the
Calabi-Yau four-orbifolds and ALE spaces. Under some assumptions on the
Hermitian-Einstein connections, we glue them together to obtain
Spin(7)-instantons on the compact Spin(7)-manifolds. We also give a simple
example of our construction.
