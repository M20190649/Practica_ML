$G_2$-instantons, associative submanifolds, and Fueter sections
We give a sufficient condition for an associative submanifold in a
G2-manifold to appear as the bubbling locus of a sequence of G2-instantons,
related to the existence of a Fueter section of a bundle of ASD instanton
moduli spaces over said submanifold.
