La borne de Jacobi pour une diffi{é}t{é} d{é}finie par un
  syst{è}me quasi r{é}gulier
We show that Jacobi's bound for the order of a system of ordinary
differential equations stands in the case of a diffiety defined by a
quasi-regular system. We extend the result when there are less equations than
variables and characterize the case when the bound is reached.
