Mirror Kaehler potential on Calabi-Yau threefolds
The classical Kaehler potential is a real-valued function (KP) such that one
can determine a Kaehler (symplectic) structure by differentiating KP. We define
a mirror Kaehler potential on Calabi-Yau 3-folds, a real-valued function (MKP)
such that one can determine a complex structure by differentiating MKP.
