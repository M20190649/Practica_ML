Graph immersions with parallel cubic form
We consider non-degenerate graph immersions in R^(n+1) whose cubic form is
parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the affine metric. There
exists a correspondence between such graph immersions and pairs (J,g), where J
is an n-dimensional real Jordan algebra and g is a non-degenerate trace form on
J. Every graph immersion with parallel cubic form can be extended to an affine
complete hypersurface immersion which is locally a graph immersion with
parallel cubic form. This affine complete immersion is a homogeneous locally
symmetric space covering the maximal connected component of zero in the set of
quasi-regular elements in the algebra J. It is an improper affine hypersphere
if and only if the corresponding Jordan algebra is nilpotent. In this case it
is an affine complete, Euclidean complete graph immersion, with the defining
function being a polynomial. Our approach can be used to study also other
classes of hypersurfaces with parallel cubic form.
