Looking at osculating bundles through the semiholonomic equalizations
The paper glosses different forms of an introducing of higher order
tangent-like functors, especially functors derived from higher order
nonholonomic tangent functors. A special attention is devoted to higher order
osculating bundles: their identification with higher order tangent bundles is
demonstrated as the main result. Chiefly, the paper is focused on the needful
unification of concepts.
