Homogeneous geodesics of non-unimodular Lorentzian Lie groups and
  naturally reductive Lorentzian spaces in dimension three
We determine, for all three-dimensional non-unimodular Lie groups equipped
with a Lorentzian metric, the set of homogeneous geodesics through a point.
Together with the results of [C] and [CM2], this leads to the full
classification of three-dimensional Lorentzian g.o. spaces and naturally
reductive spaces.
