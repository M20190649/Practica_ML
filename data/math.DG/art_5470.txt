Stability properties and topology at infinity of f-minimal hypersurfaces
We study stability properties of $f$-minimal hypersurfaces isometrically
immersed in weighted manifolds with non-negative Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature
under volume growth conditions. Moreover, exploiting a weighted version of a
finiteness result and the adaptation to this setting of Li-Tam theory, we
investigate the topology at infinity of $f$-minimal hypersurfaces. On the way,
we prove a new comparison result in weighted geometry and we provide a general
weighted $L^1$-Sobolev inequality for hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard weighted
manifolds, satisfying suitable restrictions on the weight function.
