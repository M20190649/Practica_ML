Height functions on Whitney umbrellas
We study the singularities of the members of the family of height functions
on Whitney umbrellas, which is also known as cross-caps, and show that the
family of the height functions is a versal unfolding. Moreover, we study local
intersections of a Whitney umbrella with a hyperplane through its singular
point.
