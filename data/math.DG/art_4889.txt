Collapsing with a lower bound on the curvature operator
Cheeger and Gromov showed that F-structures are related to collapse with a
double-sided curvature bound. We define fibered F-structures and extend some of
the Cheeger-Gromov results to the setting of collapse with a lower bound on the
curvature operator.
