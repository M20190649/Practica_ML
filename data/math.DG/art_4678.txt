Positive mass and Penrose type inequalities for asymptotically
  hyperbolic hypersurfaces
We establish versions of the Positive Mass and Penrose inequalities for a
class of asymptotically hyperbolic hypersurfaces. In particular, under the
usual dominant energy condition, we prove in all dimensions $n\geq 3$ an
optimal Penrose inequality for certain graphs in hyperbolic space $\mathbb
H^{n+1}$ whose boundary has constant mean curvature $n-1$.
