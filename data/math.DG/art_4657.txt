The Calabi-Yau equation for $T^2$-bundles over $\mathbb{T}^2$: the
  non-Lagrangian case
In the spirit of [10,2], we study the Calabi-Yau equation on $T^2$-bundles
over $\mathbb{T}^2$ endowed with an invariant non-Lagrangian almost-K\"ahler
structure showing that for $T^2$-invariant initial data it reduces to a
Monge-Amp\`ere equation having a unique solution. In this way we prove that for
every total space $M^4$ of an orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\mathbb{T}^2$
endowed with an invariant almost-K\"ahler structure the Calabi-Yau problem has
a solution for every normalized $T^2$-invariant volume form.
