On Sasakian manifolds with special transverse holonomy
We study compact Sasakian manifolds whose Tondeur connection has holonomy
group either trivial or contained in Sp(n). We show that the first condition
forces the manifold to be a compact quotient of the Heisenberg Lie group, while
in the simply-connected case a Sasakian structure has the holonomy of the
Tondeur connection contained in Sp(n) if and only if there exists a transverse
hypercomplex structure. This latter result is the "Sasakian version" of a
theorem of Verbitsky.
