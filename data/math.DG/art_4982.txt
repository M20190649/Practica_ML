Invariant tensors related with natural connections for a class
  Riemannian product manifolds
Some invariant tensors in two Naveira classes of Riemannian product manifolds
are considered. These tensors are related with natural connections, i.e. linear
connections preserving the Riemannian metric and the product structure.
