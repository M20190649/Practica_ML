On the existence of orthonormal geodesic bases for Lie algebras
We show that every unimodular Lie algebra, of dimension at most 4, equipped
with an inner product, possesses an orthonormal basis comprised of geodesic
elements. On the other hand, we give an example of a solvable unimodular Lie
algebra of dimension 5 that has no orthonormal geodesic basis, for any inner
product.
