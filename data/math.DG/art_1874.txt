Eigenvalue estimates for Dirac operator with the generalized APS
  boundary condition
Under two boundary conditions, the generalized Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary
condition and the modified generalized -Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary
condition, we get the lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the fundamental Dirac
operator on compact spin manifolds with nonempty boundary.
