Curvature Properties of Two Naveira Classes of Riemannian Product
  Manifolds
The main aim of the present work is to obtain some curvature properties of
the manifolds from two classes of Riemannian product manifolds. These classes
are two basic classes from Naveira classification of Riemannian almost product
manifolds.
