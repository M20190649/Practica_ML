Global Structure of Locally Convex Hypersurfaces in Finsler-Hadamard
  Manifolds
Locally convex compact immersed hypersurfaces in Finsler-Hadamard manifolds
with bounded T-curvature are considered. We prove that such hypersurfaces are
embedded as the boundary of convex body under certain conditions on the normal
curvatures
