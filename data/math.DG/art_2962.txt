Two non existence results for the self-similar equation in Euclidean
  3-space
We prove that the only self-similar surfaces of Euclidean 3-space which are
foliated by circles are the self-similar surfaces of revolution discovered by
S. Angenent and that the only ruled, self-similar surfaces are the cylinders
over planar self-similar curves.
