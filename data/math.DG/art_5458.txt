Properly embedded, area-minimizing surfaces in hyperbolic $3$-space
We prove prove a bridge principle at infinity for area-minimizing surfaces in
the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$, and we use it to prove that any open,
connected, orientable surface can be properly embedded in $\mathbb{H}^3$ as an
area-minimizing surface. Moreover, the embedding can be constructed in such a
way that the limit sets of different ends are disjoint.
