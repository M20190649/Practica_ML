Formality and symplectic structures of almost abelian solvmanifolds
In this paper we study some properties of almost abelian solvmanifolds using
minimal models associated to a fibration. In particular we state a necessary
and sufficient condition to formality and a method for finding symplectic
strucures of this kind of solvmanifolds.
