Equivalences of Smooth and Continuous Principal Bundles with
  Infinite-Dimensional Structure Group
Let K be a a Lie group, modeled on a locally convex space, and M a
finite-dimensional paracompact manifold with corners. We show that each
continuous principal K-bundle over M is continuously equivalent to a smooth one
and that two smooth principal K-bundles over M which are continuously
equivalent are also smoothly equivalent. In the concluding section, we relate
our results to neighboring topics.
