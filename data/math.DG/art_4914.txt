Null Similar Curves with Variable Transformations in Minkowski 3-space
In this study, we define a family of null curves in Minkowski 3-space and
called null similar curves. We obtain some properties of these special curves.
We show that two null curves are null similar curves if and only if these
curves form a null Bertrand pair. Moreover, we obtain that the family of null
geodesics and null helices form the families of null similar curves with
variable transformation.
