Finsler manifolds with general symmetries
In this paper, we study generalized symmetric Finsler spaces. We first study
symmetry preserving diffeomorphisms, then we show that the group of symmetry
preserving diffeomorphisms is a transitive Lie transformation group. Finally we
give some existence theorems.
