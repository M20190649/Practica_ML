Transitive conformal holonomy groups
For $(M,[g])$ a conformal manifold of signature $(p,q)$ and dimension at
least three, the conformal holonomy group $\mathrm{Hol}(M,[g]) \subset
O(p+1,q+1)$ is an invariant induced by the canonical Cartan geometry of
$(M,[g])$. We give a description of all possible connected conformal holonomy
groups which act transitively on the M\"obius sphere $S^{p,q}$, the homogeneous
model space for conformal structures of signature $(p,q)$. The main part of
this description is a list of all such groups which also act irreducibly on
$\R^{p+1,q+1}$. For the rest, we show that they must be compact and act
decomposably on $\R^{p+1,q+1}$, in particular, by known facts about conformal
holonomy the conformal class $[g]$ must contain a metric which is locally
isometric to a so-called special Einstein product.
