H-minimal Lagrangian fibrations in Kahler manifolds and minimal
  Lagrangian vanishing tori in Kahler-Einstein manifolds
H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in general K\"{a}hler manifolds generalize
special Lagrangian submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper we will
use the deformation theory of H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in K\"{a}hler
manifolds to construct minimal Lagrangian torus in certain K\"{a}hler-Einstein
manifolds with negative first Chern class.
