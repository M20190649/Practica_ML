Characterizations of Special Curves
In this study, the new characterizations of special curves are investigated
without using the curvatures of these special curves: general helices, slant
helices, Bertrand curves, Mannheim curves. The curvatures are given by the help
of the norms of the derivatives of Frenet vectors.
