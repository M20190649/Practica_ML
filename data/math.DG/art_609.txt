The Existence of Cartan Connections and Geometrizable Principal Bundles
The aim of this article is to proof a necessary and sufficient condition for
the existence of a Cartan connection on a principal bundle. After collecting
the essentially well known facts to fix the terminology, soldering forms and
geometrizable principal bundles are defined to finally prove the existence
criterion.
