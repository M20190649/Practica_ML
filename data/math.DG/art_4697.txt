On Generalized Euler Spirals in E^3
The Cornu spirals on plane are the curves whose curvatures are linear.
Generalized planar cornu spirals and Euler spirals in E^3, the curves whose
curvatures are linear are defined in [1,5]. In this study, these curves are
presented as the ratio of two rational linear functions. Also here, generalized
Euler spirals in E^3 has been defined and given their some various
characterizations. The approach I used in this paper is useful in understanding
the role of Euler spirals in E^3 in differential geometry.
