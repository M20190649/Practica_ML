Biharmonic holomorphic maps and conformally Kahler geometry
We give conditions on the Lee vector field of an almost Hermitian manifold
such that any holomorphic map from this manifold into a (1,2)-symplectic
manifold must satisfy the fourth-order condition of being biharmonic, hence
generalizing the Lichnerowicz theorem on harmonic maps. These third-order
non-linear conditions are shown to greatly simplify on l.c.K. manifolds and
construction methods and examples are given in all dimensions.
