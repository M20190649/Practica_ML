Biharmonic maps into a Riemannian manifold of non-positive curvature
We study biharmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds with finite energy and
finite bi-energy. We show that if the domain is complete and the target of
non-positive curvature, then such a map is harmonic. We then give applications
to isometric immersions and horizontally conformal submersions.
