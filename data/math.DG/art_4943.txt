Conformal polynomial parameterizations
The current paper discusses some new results about conformal polynomic
surface parameterizations. A new theorem is proved: Given a conformal polynomic
surface parameterization of any degree it must be harmonic on each component.
  As a first geometrical application, every surface that admits a conformal
polynomic parameterization must be a minimal surface. This is not the case for
rational conformal polynomic parameterizations, where the conformal condition
does not imply that components must be harmonic.
  Finally, a new general theorem is established for conformal polynomic
parameterizations of m-dimensional hypersurfaces, m > 2, in R^n, with n>m: The
only conformal polynomic parameterizations of a m-dimensional hypersurfaces, in
R^n, with m > 2 and n>=m, must be formed by lineal polynomials, i.e. the
parameter must be a rotation, scale transformation, reflection or translation
of the usual cartesian framework.
