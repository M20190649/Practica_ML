A note on surfaces in $\h^2\times\r$
In this article we consider surfaces in the product space $\h^2\times \r$ of
the hyperbolic plane $\h^2$ with the real line. The main results are: a
description of some geometric properties of minimal graphs; new examples of
complete minimal graphs; the classification of umbilical surfaces.
