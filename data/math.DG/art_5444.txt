Local obstructions to projective surfaces admitting skew-symmetric Ricci
  tensor
The equation determining whether a projective structure admits a connection
in its given projective class that has skew-symmetric Ricci tensor is an
overdetermined system of semi-linear partial differential equations which we
call the projective Einstein-Weyl (pEW) equation. In 2-dimensions, we give
local obstructions for projective surfaces to admit such a connection in its
projective class. The obstructions are the resultants of polynomial equations
that have to be satisfied for there to admit any pEW solution.
