Stable Higgs bundles and Hermitian-Einstein metrics on non-KÃ¤hler
  manifolds
Let $X$ be a compact Gauduchon manifold, and let $E$ and $V_0$ be holomorphic
vector bundles over $X$. Suppose that $E$ is stable when considering all
subsheaves preserved by a Higgs field $\theta\in H^0($End$(E)\otimes V_0)$.
Then a modified version of the Donaldson heat flow converges along a
subsequence of times to a solution of a generalized Hermitian-Einstein
equation, given by $i\Lambda F+[\theta,\theta^\dagger]=\lambda I$.
