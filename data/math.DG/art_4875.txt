On the full holonomy group of special Lorentzian manifolds
We study the full holonomy group of Lorentzian manifolds with a parallel null
line bundle. We prove several results that are based on the classification of
the restricted holonomy groups of such manifolds and provide a construction
method for manifolds with disconnected holonomy which starts from a Riemannian
manifold and a properly discontinuous group of isometries. Most of our examples
are quotients of pp-waves with disconnected holonomy and without parallel
vector field. Furthermore, we classify the full holonomy groups of solvable
Lorentzian symmetric spaces and of Lorentzian manifolds with a parallel null
spinor. Finally, we construct examples of globally hyperbolic manifolds with
complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces, disconnected full holonomy and a
parallel spinor.
