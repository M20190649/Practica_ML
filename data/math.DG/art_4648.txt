Connection preserving actions are topologically engaging
Topologically and geometrically engaging actions have proved to be useful to
obtain rigidity results for semisimple Lie group actions. We show that the
action of a simple noncompact Lie group on a compact manifold preserving a
unimodular rigid geometric structure of algebraic type (e.g. a connection
together with a volume density) is topologically engaging on an open conull
dense set.
