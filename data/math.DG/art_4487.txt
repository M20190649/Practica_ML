SpinC quantization in odd dimensions
We define and discuss an extension of the SpinC quantization concept to
odd-dimensional manifolds. After that we describe its relation to (the usual)
even-dimensional SpinC quantization and how its famous properties like
"Quantization commutes with reduction" can be regained in odd dimensions. At
the end, we analyze the situation on 3-manifolds and give some examples.
