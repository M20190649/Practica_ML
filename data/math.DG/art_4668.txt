Clifford-Wolf Translations of Finsler spaces
In this paper, we study Clifford-Wolf translations of Finsler spaces. We
first give a characterization of Clifford-Wolf translations of Finsler spaces
in terms of Killing vector fields. In particular, we show that there is a
natural correspondence between Clifford-Wolf translations and the Killing
vector fields of constant length. In the special case of homogeneous Randers
spaces, we give some explicit sufficient and necessary conditions for an
isometry to be a Clifford-Wolf translation. Finally, we construct some explicit
examples to explain some of the results of this paper.
