The geometry of lightlike surfaces in Minkowski space
We investigate the geometric properties of lightlike surfaces in the
Minkowski space $\R^{2,1}$, using Cartan's method of moving frames to compute a
complete set of local invariants for such surfaces. Using these invariants, we
give a complete local classification of lightlike surfaces of constant type in
$\R^{2,1}$ and construct new examples of such surfaces.
