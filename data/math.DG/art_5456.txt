Anti-Invariant Riemannian Submersions from Cosymplectic Manifolds
We introduce anti-invariant Riemannian submersions from cosymplectic
manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We survey main results of anti-invariant
Riemannian submersions defined on cosymplectic manifolds. We investigate
necessary and sufficient condition for an anti-invariant Riemannian submersion
to be totally geodesic and harmonic. We give examples of anti-invariant
submersions such that characteristic vector field {\xi} is vertical or
horizontal. Moreover we give decomposition theorems by using the existence of
anti-invariant Riemannian submersions.
