A natural connection on some classes of almost contact manifolds with
  B-metric
Almost contact manifolds with B-metric are considered. A special linear
connection is introduced, which preserves the almost contact B-metric structure
on these manifolds. This connection is investigated on some classes of the
considered manifolds.
