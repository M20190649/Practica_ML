L^2 Harmonic 1-forms on submanifolds with finite total curvature
Let $x:M^m\to \bar M$, with $m\geq 3$, be an isometric immersion of a
complete noncompact manifold $M$ in a complete simply-connected manifold $\bar
M$ with sectional curvature satisfying $-c^2\leq K_{\bar M}\leq 0$, for some
constant $c$. Assume that the immersion has finite total curvature. If $c\neq
0$, assume further that the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $M$ is bounded
from below by a suitable constant. We prove that the space of the $L^2$
harmonic 1-forms on $M$ has finite dimension. Moreover there exists a constant
$\La>0$, explicitly computed, such that if the total curvature is bounded from
above by $\La$ then there is no nontrivial $L^2$-harmonic 1-forms on $M$.
