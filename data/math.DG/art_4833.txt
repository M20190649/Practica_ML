Surfaces in three-dimensional space forms with divergence-free
  stress-bienergy tensor
We introduce the notion of biconservative hypersurfaces, that is
hypersurfaces with conservative stress-energy tensor with respect to the
bienergy. We give the (local) classification of biconservative surfaces in
3-dimensional space forms.
