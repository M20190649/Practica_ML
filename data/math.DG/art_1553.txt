Twistors and 3-symmetric spaces
We describe complex twistor spaces over inner 3-symmetric spaces $G/H$, such
that $H$ acts transitively on the fibre. Like in the symmetric case, these are
flag manifolds $G/K$ where $K$ is the centralizer of a torus in $G$. Moreover,
they carry an almost complex structure defined using the horizontal
distribution of the normal connection on $G/H$, that coincides with the complex
structure associated to a parabolic subgroup $P \subset G^{\mathbb C}$ if it is
integrable. Conversely, starting from a complex flag manifold $G^{\mathbb
C}/P$, there exists a natural fibration with complex fibres on a 3-symmetric
space, called fibration of degree 3.
