Chern-Osserman inequality for minimal surfaces in a Cartan-Hadamard
  manifold with strictly negative sectional curvatures
We state and prove a Chern-Osserman Inequality in terms of the volume growth
for minimal surfaces properly immersed in a Cartan-Hadamard manifold N with
sectional curvatures bounded from above by a negative quantity.
