Dirac operators on foliations: the Lichnerowicz inequality
We construct Dirac operators on foliations by applying the Bismut-Lebeau
analytic localization technique to the Connes fibration over a foliation. The
Laplacian of the resulting Dirac operators has better lower bound than that
obtained by using the usual adiabatic limit arguments on the original
foliation. As a consequence, we prove an extension of the Lichnerowicz-Hitchin
vanishing theorem to the case of foliations.
