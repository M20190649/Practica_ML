Biharmonic PNMC Submanifolds in Spheres
We obtain several rigidity results for biharmonic submanifolds in
$\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with parallel normalized mean curvature vector field. We
classify biharmonic submanifolds in $\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with parallel normalized
mean curvature vector field and with at most two distinct principal curvatures.
In particular, we determine all biharmonic surfaces with parallel normalized
mean curvature vector field in $\mathbb{S}^n$.
  Then we investigate, for (not necessarily compact) proper biharmonic
submanifolds in $\mathbb{S}^n$, their type in the sense of B-Y. Chen. We prove:
(i) a proper biharmonic submanifold in $\mathbb{S}^n$ is of 1-type or 2-type if
and only if it has constant mean curvature ${\mcf}=1$ or ${\mcf}\in(0,1)$,
respectively; (ii) there are no proper biharmonic 3-type submanifolds with
parallel normalized mean curvature vector field in $\mathbb{S}^n$.
