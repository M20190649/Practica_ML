Displacement interpolations from a Hamiltonian point of view
One of the most well-known results in the theory of optimal transportation is
the equivalence between the convexity of the entropy functional with respect to
the Riemannian Wasserstein metric and the Ricci curvature lower bound of the
underlying Riemannian manifold. There are also generalizations of this result
to the Finsler manifolds and manifolds with a Ricci flow background. In this
paper, we study displacement interpolations from the point of view of
Hamiltonian systems and give a unifying approach to the above mentioned
results.
