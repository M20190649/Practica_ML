On Noncommutative Principal Bundles with Finite Abelian Structure Group
Let $\Lambda$ be a finite abelian group. A dynamical system with
transformation group $\Lambda$ is a triple $(A,\Lambda,\alpha)$, consisting of
a unital locally convex algebra $A$, the finite abelian group $\Lambda$ and a
group homomorphism $\alpha:\Lambda\rightarrow\Aut(A)$, which induces an action
of $\Lambda$ on $A$. In this paper we present a new, geometrically oriented
approach to the noncommutative geometry of principal bundles with finite
abelian structure group based on such dynamical systems.
