Variation of the modulus of a foliation
The $p$--modulus ${\rm mod}_p(\mathcal{F})$ of a foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on a
Riemannian manifold $M$ is a generalization of extremal length of plane curves
introduced by L. Ahlfors. We study the variation $t\mapsto{\rm
mod}_p(\mathcal{F}_t)$ of the modulus. In particular, we consider product of
moduli of orthogonal foliations.
