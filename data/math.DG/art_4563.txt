New results toward the classification of Biharmonic submanifolds in
  $\mathbb{S}^{n}$
We prove some new rigidity results for proper biharmonic immersions in
${\mathbb S}^n$ of the following types: Dupin hypersurfaces; hypersurfaces,
both compact and non-compact, with bounded norm of the second fundamental form;
hypersurfaces satisfying intrinsic properties; PMC submanifolds; parallel
submanifolds.
