Orthonormal Basis in Minkowski Space
Finsler space is differentiable manifold for which Minkowski space is the
fiber of the tangent bundle. To understand structure of the reference frame in
Finsler space, we need to understand the structure of orthonormal basis in
Minkowski space.
  In this paper, we considered the definition of orthonormal basis in Minkowski
space, the structure of metric tensor relative to orthonormal basis, procedure
of orthogonalization. Linear transformation of Minkowski space mapping at least
one orthonormal basis into orthonormal basis is called motion. The set of
motions of Minkowski space V generates not complete group SO(V) which acts
single transitive on the basis manifold.
  Passive transformation of Minkowski space mapping at least one orthonormal
basis into orthonormal basis is called quasimotion of Minkowski space. The set
of passive transformations of Minkowski space generates passive representation
of not complete group SO(V) on basis manifold. Since twin representations
(active and passive) of not complete group SO(V) on basis manifold are single
transitive, then we may consider definition of geometric object.
