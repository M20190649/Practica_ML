Generalized Weierstrass representation for surfaces in terms of
  Dirac-Hestenes spinor field
A representation of generalized Weierstrass formulae for an immersion of
generic surfaces into a 4-dimensional complex space in terms of spinors treated
as minimal left ideals of Clifford algebras is proposed. The relation between
integrable deformations of surfaces via mVN-hierarchy and integrable
deformations of spinor fields on the surface is also discussed.
