On locally phi-semisymmetric Sasakian manifolds
Generalizing the notion of local $\phi$-symmetry of Takahashi, in the present
paper, we introduce the notion of local $\phi$-semisymmetry of a Sasakian
manifold along with its proper existence and characterization. We also study
the notion of local Ricci (resp., projective, conformal) $\phi$-semisymmetry of
a Sasakian manifold and obtain its characterization. It is shown that the local
$\phi$-semisymmetry, local projective $\phi$-semisymmetry and local concircular
$\phi$-semisymmetry are equivalent. It is also shown that local conformal
$\phi$-semisymmetry and local conharmonical $\phi$-semisymmetry are equivalent.
