Some relationships between the geometry of the tangent bundle and the
  geometry of the Riemannian base manifold
We compute the curvature tensor of the tangent bundle of a Riemannian
manifold endowed with a natural metric and we get some relationships between
the geometry of the base manifold and the geometry of the tangent bundle.
