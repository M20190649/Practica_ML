Constructing isothermal curvature line coordinates on surfaces which
  admit them
Isothermic parameterizations} are synonyms of isothermal curvature line
parameterizations, for surfaces immersed in Euclidean spaces. We provide a
method of constructing isothermic coordinate charts on surfaces which admit
them, starting from an arbitrary chart. One of the primary applications of this
work consists of numerical algorithms for surface visualization.
