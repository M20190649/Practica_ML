On Timelike and Spacelike Developable Ruled Surfaces
In this study, we have obtained the distribution parameter of a ruled surface
generated by a straight line in Frenet trihedron moving along a timelike curve
and also along another curve with the same parameter. At this time, the Frenet
frames of these timelike curves are not the same. We have moved the director
vector of the first curve along the second curve. It is shown that the ruled
surface is developable if and only if the base timelike curve is helix. In
addition, some smilarities and differences are presented with theorems and
results.
