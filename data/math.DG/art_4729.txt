Associated Families of Immersions of Three Dimensional CR Manifolds in
  Euclidean Spaces
We consider isometric immersions in arbitrary codimension of
three-dimensional strongly pseudoconvex pseudo-hermitian CR manifolds into the
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and generalize in a natural way the notion of
associated family. We show that the existence of such deformations turns out to
be very restrictive and we give a complete classification.
