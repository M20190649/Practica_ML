Ricci flow and curvature on the variety of flags on the two dimensional
  projective space over the complexes, quaternions and the octonions
For homogeneous metrics on the spaces of the title it is shown that the Ricci
flow can move a metric of stricly positive sectional curvature to one with some
negative sectional curvature and one of positive definite Ricci tensor to one
with indefinite signature.
