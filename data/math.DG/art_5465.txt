The Hartogs extension phenomenon for holomorphic parabolic and reductive
  geometries
Every holomorphic effective parabolic or reductive geometry on a domain over
a Stein manifold extends uniquely to the envelope of holomorphy of the domain.
This result completes the open problems of my earlier paper on extension of
holomorphic geometric structures on complex manifolds. We use this result to
classify the Hopf manifolds which admit holomorphic reductive geometries, and
to classify the Hopf manifolds which admit holomorphic parabolic geometries.
Every Hopf manifold which admits a holomorphic parabolic geometry with a given
model admits a flat one. We classify flat holomorphic parabolic geometries on
Hopf manifolds.
