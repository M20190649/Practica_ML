Attenuated tensor tomography on simple surfaces
In this paper we consider the geodesic X-ray transform with attenuation
coefficient as a combination of smooth complex function and 1-form. We show
that attenuated X-ray transform applied to the pair of tensors is injective
modulo the natural obstruction.
