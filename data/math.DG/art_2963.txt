Area minimization among marginally trapped surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski
  space
We study an area minimization problem for spacelike zero mean curvature
surfaces in four dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space. The areas of these
surfaces are compared of with the areas of certain marginally trapped surfaces
having the same boundary values.
