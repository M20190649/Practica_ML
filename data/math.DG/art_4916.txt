The Attenuated Magnetic Ray Transform on Surfaces
It has been shown in [Pa1] that on a simple, compact Riemannian 2-manifold
the attenuated geodesic ray transform, with attenuation given by a connection
and Higgs field, is injective on functions and 1-forms modulo the natural
obstruction. Furthermore, the scattering relation determines the connection and
Higgs field modulo a gauge transformation. We extend the results obtained
therein to the case of magnetic geodesics. In addition, we provide an
application to tensor tomography in the magnetic setting, along the lines of
[Pa2].
