New Representations of Bertrand Pairs in Euclidean 3-Space
In this work, we studied the properties of the spherical indicatrices of a
Bertrand curve and its mate curve and presented some characteristic properties
in the cases that Bertrand curve and its mate curve are slant helices,
spherical indicatrices are slant helices and we also researched that whether
the spherical indicatrices made new curve pairs in the means of Mannheim,
involte-evolute and Bertrand pairs. Further more, we investigated the relations
between the spherical images and introduced new representations of spherical
indicatrices.
