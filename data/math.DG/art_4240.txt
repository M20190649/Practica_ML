The geometry of embedded pseudo-Riemannian surfaces in terms of Poisson
  brackets
Arnlind, Hoppe and Huisken showed how to express the Gauss and mean curvature
of a surface embedded in a Riemannian manifold in terms of Poisson brackets of
the embedding coordinates. We generalize these expressions to the
pseudo-Riemannian setting and derive explicit formulas for the case of surfaces
embedded in $\R^m$ with indefinite metric.
