Kaehler-Ricci solitons on homogeneous toric bundles (II)
It is proved that an homogeneous toric bundles over a flag manifold G^\C/P
admits a Kaehler-Ricci solitonic metric if and only if it is Fano. In
particular, an homogeneous toric bundle of this kind is Kaehler-Einstein if and
only if it is Fano and its Futaki invariant vanishes identically.
