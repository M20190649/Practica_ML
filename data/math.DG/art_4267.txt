Pseudo-Riemannian Weakly Symmetric Manifolds
There is a well developed theory of weakly symmetric Riemannian manifolds.
Here it is shown that several results in the Riemannian case are also valid for
weakly symmetric pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, but some require additional
hypotheses. The topics discussed are homogeneity, geodesic completeness, the
geodesic orbit property, weak symmetries, and the structure of the nilradical
of the isometry group. Also, we give a number of examples of weakly symmetric
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, some mirroring the Riemannian case and some
indicating the problems in extending Riemannian results to weakly symmetric
pseudo-Riemannian spaces.
