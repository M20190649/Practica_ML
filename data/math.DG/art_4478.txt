Stable closed equilibria for anisotropic surface energies: Surfaces with
  edges
We study the stability of closed, not necessarily smooth, equilibrium
surfaces of an anisotropic surface energy for which the Wulff shape is not
necessarily smooth. We show that if the Cahn Hoffman field can be extended
continuously to the whole surface and if the surface is stable, then the
surface is, up to rescaling, the Wulff shape.
