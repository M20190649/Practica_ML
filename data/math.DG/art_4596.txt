Invariant surfaces in Sol$_3$ with constant mean curvature and their
  computer graphics
In Sol$_3$ space there are three uniparametric groups of isometries. In this
work we study constant mean curvature surfaces invariant by one of these
groups. We analyze the geometric properties of these surfaces by means of their
computer graphics. We construct explicit examples of minimal surfaces and we
shall relate them with recent examples of spheres with constant mean curvature.
