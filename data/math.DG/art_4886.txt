La Grassmannienne non-linéaire comme variété fréchétique
  homogène
Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n. For k \in
{0,...,n}, we denote Gr_{k}(M) the set of compact, connected and oriented
submanifolds of M of dimension k. This set is called the non-linear
Grassmannian. In this article, we endow Gr_{k}(M) with a smooth Fr\'echet
manifold structure and investigate its basic geometrical properties. In
particular, if \Sigma \in Gr_{k}(M), we show that the space of smooth
embeddings Emb(\Sigma,M) is the total space of principal fiber bundle with base
space a collection of connected components of Gr_{k}(M). We also show that the
connected components of Gr_{k}(M) are homogeneous with respect to the natural
action of the group of diffeomorphisms of M.
