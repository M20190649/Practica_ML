A Semiclassical Heat Kernel Proof of the Poincar√©-Hopf Theorem
We treat the Witten operator on the de Rham complex with semiclassical heat
kernel methods to derive the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem and degenerate
generalizations of it. Thereby, we see how the semiclassical asymptotics of the
Witten heat kernel are related to approaches using the Thom form of Mathai and
Quillen.
