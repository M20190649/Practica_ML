Constant Angle Ruled Surfaces in Euclidean Spaces
In this paper, we study the special curves and ruled surfaces on helix
hypersurface whose tangent planes make a constant angle with a fixed direction
in Euclidean n-space Besides, we observe some special ruled surfaces in and
give requirement of being developable of the ruled surface. Also, we
investigate the helix surface generated by a plane curve in Euclidean 3-space .
