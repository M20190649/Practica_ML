On 4-dimensional, conformally flat, almost $ε$-Kählerian
  manifolds
The local structure of 4-dimensional, conformally flat, almost
$\epsilon$-K\"ahlerian (i.e., almost pseudo-K\"ahlerian and almost
para-K\"ahlerian) manifolds is characterized with the help of left-regular and
right-regular paraquaternionic functions. Examples of such structures are
discussed.
