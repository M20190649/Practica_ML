On $(N(k),Î¾)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds: Semisymmetries
$(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are defined. Examples and properties
of $(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are given. Some relations involving
${\cal T}_{a}$-curvature tensor in $(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are
proved. $\xi $-${\cal T}_{a}$-flat $(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are
defined. It is proved that if $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $\xi $-${\cal
T}_{a}$-flat $(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifold, then it is $\eta $-Einstein
under an algebraic condition. We prove that a semi-Riemannian manifold, which
is $T$-recurrent or $T$-symmetric, is always $T$-semisymmetric, where $T$ is
any tensor of type $(1,3)$. $({\cal T}_{a}, {\cal T}_{b}) $-semisymmetric
semi-Riemannian manifold is defined and studied. The results for ${\cal
T}_{a}$-semisymmetric, ${\cal T}_{a}$-symmetric, ${\cal T}_{a}$-recurrent
$(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are obtained. The definition of $({\cal
T}_{a},S_{{\cal T}_{b}})$-semisymmetric semi-Riemannian manifold is given.
$({\cal T}_{a},S_{{\cal T}_{b}})$-semisymmetric $(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian
manifolds are classified. Some results for ${\cal T}_{a}$-Ricci-semisymmetric
$(N(k),\xi)$-semi-Riemannian manifolds are obtained.
