Moving frames on generalized Finsler structures
We study the relation between an R-Cartan structure {\alpha} and an (I, J,
K)- generalized Finsler structure on a 3-manifold showing the difficulty in
finding a general transformation that maps these structures each other. In some
particular cases, the mapping can be uniquely determined by geometrical
conditions.
