The space of leftinvariant orthogonal almost complex structures on
  6-dimensional Lie groups
The space $\mathcal{Z}$ of leftinvariant orthogonal almost complex
structures, keeping the orientation, on 6-dimensional Lie groups is researched.
To get explicit view of this space elements the isomorphism of $\mathcal{Z}$
and $\mathbb{C}P^3$ is used. The explicit formula for arbitrary leftinvariant
orthogonal almost complex structure on 6-dimensional Lie group as composition
of rotations is found.
