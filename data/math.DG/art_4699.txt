Einstein Hermitian Metrics of Non Negative Sectional Curvature
We prove that a simpy connected Hermitian Einstein 4-manifold with
non-negative sectional curvature is isometric to complex projective space
$\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{2}$ with the Fubini-Study metric or isometric to the
product $\mathbb{S}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{2}$ with the canonical metric.
