Ricci flow unstable cell centered at an Einstein metric on the twistor
  space of positive quaternion KÃ¤hler manifolds of dimension $\geq 8$
We show that a 1-parameter family Ricci flow ancient solutions arises from
the natural collapsings of the twistor space of positive quaternion K\"ahler
manifolds. We use these ancient solutions to show that a positive quaternion
K\"ahler manifold is isometric to one of the Wolf spaces.
