On Functions with a Conjugate
Harmonic functions of two variables are exactly those that admit a conjugate,
namely a function whose gradient has the same length and is everywhere
orthogonal to the gradient of the original function. We show that there are
also partial differential equations controlling the functions of three
variables that admit a conjugate.
