A note on solvable Lie groups without lattices and the Felix-Thomas
  models of fibrations
In this paper we show that a certain solvable Lie group constructed in a
paper by Benson and Gordon has no lattices. This result answers (in the
negative way) a question posed by several authors in the context of symplectic
geometry. The main theorem is proved with the use of rational homotopy theory.
