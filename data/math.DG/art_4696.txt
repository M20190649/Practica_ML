Some Characterizations of Euler Spirals in E_1^{3}
In this study, some characterizations of Euler spirals in E_1^{3} have been
presented by using their main property that their curvatures are linear.
Moreover, discussing some properties of Bertrand curves and helices, the
relationship between these special curves in E_1^{3} have been investigated
with different theorems and examples. The approach we used in this paper is
useful in understanding the role of Euler spirals in E_1^{3} in differential
geometry.
