General Rotational Surfaces with Pointwise 1-Type Gauss Map in Pseudo-
  Euclidean Space E42
In this paper, we study general rotational surfaces in the 4- dimensional
pseudo-Euclidean space E4-2 and obtain a characterization of flat general
rotation surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map in E4-2 and give an example
of such surfaces.
