Riemannian geometry on the quantomorphism group
We are interested in the geometry of the group $\mathcal{D}_q(M)$ of
diffeomorphisms preserving a contact form $\theta$ on a manifold $M$. We define
a Riemannian metric on $\mathcal{D}_q(M)$, compute the corresponding geodesic
equation, and show that solutions exist for all time and depend smoothly on
initial conditions. In certain special cases (such as on the 3-sphere), the
geodesic equation is a simplified version of the quasigeostrophic equation, so
we obtain a new geodesic interpretation of this geophysical system. We also
show that the genuine quasigeostrophic equation on $S^2$ can be obtained as an
Euler-Arnold equation on a one-dimensional central extension of
$T_{\id}\mathcal{D}_q(M)$, and that our global existence result extends to this
case.
  If $E$ is the Reeb field of $\theta$ and $\mu$ is the volume form, assumed
compatible in the sense that $\text{div} E=0$, we show that $\mathcal{D}_q(M)$
is a smooth submanifold of $\mathcal{D}_{E,\mu}(M)$, the space of
diffeomorphisms preserving the vector field $E$ and the volume form $\mu$, in
the sense of $H^s$ Sobolev completions. The latter manifold is related to
symmetric motion of ideal fluids. We further prove that the corresponding
geodesic equations and projections are $C^{\infty}$ objects in the Sobolev
topology.
