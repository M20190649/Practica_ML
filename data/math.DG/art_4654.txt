Optimal isoperimetric inequalities for complete proper minimal
  submanifolds in hyperbolic space
Let $\Sigma$ be a $k$-dimensional complete proper minimal submanifold in the
Poincar\'{e} ball model $B^n$ of hyperbolic geometry. If we consider $\Sigma$
as a subset of the unit ball $B^n$ in Euclidean space, we can measure the
Euclidean volumes of the given minimal submanifold $\Sigma$ and the ideal
boundary $\partial_\infty \Sigma$, say $\rvol(\Sigma)$ and
$\rvol(\partial_\infty \Sigma)$, respectively. Using this concept, we prove an
optimal linear isoperimetric inequality. We also prove that if
$\rvol(\partial_\infty \Sigma) \geq \rvol(\mathbb{S}^{k-1})$, then $\Sigma$
satisfies the classical isoperimetric inequality. By proving the monotonicity
theorem for such $\Sigma$, we further obtain a sharp lower bound for the
Euclidean volume $\rvol(\Sigma)$, which is an extension of Fraser and Schoen's
recent result \cite{FS} to hyperbolic space. Moreover we introduce the
M\"{o}bius volume of $\Sigma$ in $B^n$ to prove an isoperimetric inequality via
the M\"{o}bius volume for $\Sigma$.
