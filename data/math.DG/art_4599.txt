Estimates for lower bounds of eigenvalues of the poly-Laplacian and
  quadratic polynomial operator of the Laplacian
In this paper, we investigate the Dirchlet eigenvalue problems of
poly-Laplacian with any order and quadratic polynomial operator of the
Laplacian. We give some estimates for lower bounds of the sums of their first
$k$ eigenvalues which improve the previous results.
