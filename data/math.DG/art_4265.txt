Weyl-Schouten Theorem for symmetric spaces
Let N be a symmetric space of dimension n > 5 whose de Rham decomposition
contains no factors of constant curvature and let W be the Weyl tensor of N at
some point. We prove that a Riemannian manifold whose Weyl tensor at every
point is a positive multiple of W is conformally equivalent to N (the case N =
R^n is the Weyl-Schouten Theorem).
