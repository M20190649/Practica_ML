Biharmonic hypersurfaces in a conformally flat space
Biharmonic hypersurfaces in a generic conformally flat space are studied in
this paper. The equation of such hypersurfaces is derived and is used to
determine the conformally flat metric $f^{-2}\delta_{ij}$ on the Euclidean
space $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ so that a minimal hypersurface $M^m\longrightarrow
(\mathbb{R}^{m+1}, \delta_{ij})$ in a Euclidean space becomes a biharmonic
hypersurface $M^m\longrightarrow (\mathbb{R}^{m+1}, f^{-2}\delta_{ij})$ in the
conformally flat space. Our examples include all biharmonic hypersurfaces found
in [Ou1] and [OT] as special cases.
