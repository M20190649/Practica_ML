Some four-dimensional almost hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds
In this paper, a lot of examples of four-dimensional manifolds with an almost
hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian structure are constructed in several explicit
ways. The received 4-manifolds are characterized by their linear invariants in
the known aspects.
