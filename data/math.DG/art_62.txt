Higher analytic torsion of sphere bundles and continuous cohomology of
  $Diff(S^{2n-1})$
Using the higher analytic torsion form of Bismut and Lott we construct a
characteristic class for smooth sphere bundles. We calculate this class in the
case where the sphere bundle comes from a complex vector bundle. Related to
these characteristic classes we define nontrivial continuous group cohomology
classes of the diffeomorphism group of odd dimensional spheres.
