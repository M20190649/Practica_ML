Anti-Invariant Riemannian Submersions from Sasakian Manifolds
We introduce anti-invariant Riemannian submersions from Sasakian manifolds
onto Riemannian manifolds. We survey main results of anti-invariant Riemannian
submersions defined on Sasakian manifolds. We investigate necessary and
sufficient condition for an anti-invariant Riemannian submersion to be totally
geodesic and harmonic. We give examples of anti-invariant submersions such that
characteristic vector field {\xi} is vertical or horizontal.
