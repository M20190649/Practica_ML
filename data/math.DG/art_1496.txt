Cohomology for a group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold preserving an
  exact form
Let $M$ be a $G$-manifold and $\om$ a $G$-invariant exact $m$-form on $M$. We
indicate when these data allow us to constract a cocycle on a group $G$ with
values in the trivial $G$-module $\mathbb R$ and when this cocycle is
nontrivial.
