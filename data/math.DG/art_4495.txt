Symmetry Reduction of Exterior Differential Systems and Backlund
  Transformations for PDE in the Plane
We approach the construction of Backlund transformations for Darboux
integrable hyperbolic partial differential equations in the plane through the
reduction of exterior differential systems. For example it is shown that all
the Backlund transformations in arXiv:0707.4408v2 can be constructed using
symmetry reduction.
