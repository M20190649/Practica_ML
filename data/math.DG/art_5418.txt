The D-topology for diffeological spaces
Diffeological spaces are generalizations of smooth manifolds which include
singular spaces and function spaces. For each diffeological space,
Iglesias-Zemmour introduced a natural topology called the $D$-topology.
However, the $D$-topology has not yet been studied seriously in the existing
literature. In this paper, we develop the basic theory of the $D$-topology for
diffeological spaces. We explain that the topological spaces that arise as the
$D$-topology of a diffeological space are exactly the $\Delta$-generated spaces
and give results and examples which help to determine when a space is
$\Delta$-generated. Our most substantial results show how the $D$-topology on
the function space $C^{\infty}(M,N)$ between smooth manifolds compares to other
well-known topologies.
