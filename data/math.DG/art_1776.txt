Completeness, Ricci blowup, the Osserman and the conformal Osserman
  condition for Walker signature (2,2) manifolds
Walker manifolds of signature (2,2) have been used to provide examples of
Osserman and of conformal Osserman manifolds of signature (2,2). We study
questions of geodesic completeness and Ricci blowup in this context.
