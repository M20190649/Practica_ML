Curvatures of weighted metrics on tangent sphere bundles
We determine the curvature equations of natural metrics on tangent bundles
and radius r tangent sphere bundles S_rM of a Riemannian manifold M. A family
of positive scalar curvature metrics on S_rM is found, for any M with bounded
sectional curvature and any chosen constant r.
