Special Legendrian submanifolds in toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
We show that every toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold $S$ admits a special
Legendrian submanifold $L$ which arises as the link ${\rm fix}(\tau)\cap S$ of
the fixed point set ${\rm fix}(\tau)$ of an anti-holomorphic involution $\tau$
on the cone $C(S)$. In particular, an irregular toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold
$S^{2}\times S^{3}$ has a special Legendrian torus $S^{1}\times S^{1}$.
Moreover, we also obtain a special Legendrian submanifold in $\sharp
m(S^{2}\times S^{3})$ for each $m\ge 1$.
