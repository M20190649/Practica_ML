Curvature properties of pseudo-sphere bundles over paraquaternionic
  manifolds
In this paper we obtain several curvature properties of the twistor and
reflector spaces of a paraquaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold and prove the
existence of both positive and negative mixed 3-Sasakian structures in a
principal SO(2,1)-bundle over a paraquaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold.
