A sharp height estimate for compact hypersurfaces with constant $k$-mean
  curvature in warped product spaces
In this paper we obtain a sharp height estimate concerning compact
hypersurfaces immersed into warped product spaces with some constant higher
order mean curvature, and whose boundary is contained into a slice. We apply
these results to draw topological conclusions at the end of the paper.
