Compactness of immersions with local Lipschitz representation
We consider immersions admitting uniform representations as an L-Lipschitz
graph. In codimension 1, we show compactness for such immersions for arbitrary
fixed finite L and uniformly bounded volume. The same result is shown in
arbitrary codimension for L less than or equal to 1/4.
