An analogue of the space of conformal blocks in (4k+2)-dimensions
Based on projective representations of smooth Deligne cohomology groups, we
introduce an analogue of the space of conformal blocks to compact oriented
(4k+2)-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary. For the standard
(4k+2)-dimensional disk, we compute the space concretely to prove that its
dimension is finite.
