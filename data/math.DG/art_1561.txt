Lagrangian submanifolds attaining equality in the improved Chen's
  inequality
Recently Oprea gave an improved version of Chen's inequality for Lagrangian
submanifolds of $\mathbb CP^n(4)$. For minimal submanifolds this inequality
coincides with the original previously proved version. We consider here those
non minimal 3-dimensional Lagrangian submanifolds in $\mathbb CP^3 (4)$
attaining at all points equality in the improved Chen inequality. We show how
all such submanifolds may be obtained starting from a minimal Lagrangian
surface in $\mathbb CP^2(4)$ and a suitable horizontal curve in $S^3(1)$.
