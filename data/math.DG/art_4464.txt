The Dirac operator on untrapped surfaces
We establish a sharp extrinsic lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the
Dirac operator of an untrapped surface in initial data sets without apparent
horizon in terms of the norm of its mean curvature vector. The equality case
leads to rigidity results for the constraint equations with spherical boundary
as well as uniqueness results for constant mean curvature surfaces in Minkowski
space.
