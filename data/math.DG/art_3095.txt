Grassmannians and conformal structure on absolutes
We study grassmannian classic geometries in the spirit of [AGr1]. The
interrelation between a (pseudo-)riemannian projective classic geometry and the
conformal structure on its ideal boundary (absolute) is explained. Such
interrelation encompasses, for instance, the usual conformal structure on the
absolute of real hyperbolic space, the usual conformal structure on the
absolute of de Sitter space, the contact structure on the absolute of complex
hyperbolic space, and the causal structure on the absolute of anti-de Sitter
space.
