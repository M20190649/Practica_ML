A classification theorem and a spectral sequence for a locally free
  sheaf cohomology of a supermanifold
This paper is based on the paper "Locally free sheaves on complex
supermanifolds" of A.L.Onishchik, E.G. Vishnyakova, where two classification
theorems for locally free sheaves on supermanifolds were proved and a spectral
sequence for a locally free sheaf of modules E was obtained. We consider
another filtration of the locally free sheaf E, the corresponding
classification theorem and the spectral sequence, which is more convenient in
some cases. The methods, which we are using here, are similar to the methods of
the paper mentioned above.
  The first spectral sequence of this kind was constructed by A.L. Onishchik
for the tangent sheaf of a supermanifold. However, the spectral sequence
considered in this paper is not a generalization of Onishchik's spectral
sequence.
