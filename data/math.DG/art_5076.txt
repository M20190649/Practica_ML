Principal torus bundles of Lorentzian S-manifolds and the Ï†-null
  Osserman condition
The main result we give in this brief note relates, under suitable
hypotheses, the {\phi}-null Osserman, the null Osserman and the classical
Osserman conditions to each other, via semi-Riemannian submersions as
projection maps of principal torus bundles arising from a Lorentzian
S-manifold.
