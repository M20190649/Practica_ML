Dupin cyclides osculating surfaces
This article is devoted to the study of cyclides osculating general surfaces.
We show that generically, at any point of a surface, one has a one-parameter
family of cyclides tangent to a surface curve of order three and among them
just one is tangent to this curve of order four. This one will be called the
osculating cyclide here. Directions of this tangency of higher order form a
line filed on the surface and its integral curves will be called Dupin lines on
the surface under consideration. Our Dupin lines are analogous to classical
lines of curvature corresponding in the same to the eigenvectors of the
Weingarten (shape) operator of a surface, that is to the directions of tangency
of order two of its osculating spheres. Each point of a generic surface meets
two orthogonal lines of curvature but only one Dupin line. Our main result
shows that a large class of foliations of open planar domains can be realized
as Dupin foliations, that is foliations by Dupin lines, on several surfaces.
