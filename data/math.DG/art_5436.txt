Curvature properties of 3-quasi-Sasakian manifolds
We find some curvature properties of 3-quasi-Sasakian manifolds which are
similar to some well-known identities holding in the Sasakian case. As an
application, we prove that any 3-quasi-Sasakian manifold of constant horizontal
sectional curvature is necessarily either 3-\alpha-Sasakian or 3-cosymplectic.
