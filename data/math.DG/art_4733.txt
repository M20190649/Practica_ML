Bi-invariant metric on the strict contactomorphism group
A right-invariant metric $\rho_{\alpha}$ on the compactly supported identity
component $Cont_0(M,\alpha)$ of the group of contactomorphisms of an arbitrary
contact manifold $(M,\alpha)$ is introduced in a similar way that the Hofer
metric was defined on the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of a
symplectic manifold. The restriction of $\rho_{\alpha}$ to the subgroup
$G(M,\alpha)$ of all strict contactomorphisms in $Cont_0(M,\alpha)$ is
bi-invariant.
