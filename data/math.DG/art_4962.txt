Construction of an A-manifold on a principal torus bundle
We construct a new example of an A-manifold, i.e. a Riemannian manifold with
a cyclic-parallel Ricci tensor, which can be viewed as a generalization of the
Einstein condition. The underlying manifold for our construction is a principal
torus bundle over K\"ahler-Einstein manifold a with fibre a torus of arbitrary
dimension.
