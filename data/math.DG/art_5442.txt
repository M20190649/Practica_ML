On $m$-Kropina Finsler Metrics of Scalar Flag Curvature
In this paper, we consider a special class of singular Finsler metrics:
$m$-Kropina metrics which are defined by a Riemannian metric and a $1$-form. We
show that an $m$-Kropina metric ($m\ne -1$) of scalar flag curvature must be
locally Minkowskian in dimension $n\ge 3$. We characterize by some PDEs a
Kropina metric ($m=-1$) which is respectively of scalar flag curvature and
locally projectively flat in dimension $n\ge 3$, and obtain some principles and
approaches of constructing non-trivial examples of Kropina metrics of scalar
flag curvature.
