Convergence of Einstein Yang-Mills Systems
In this paper, we prove a convergence theorem for sequences of Einstein
Yang-Mills systems on $U(1) $-bundles over closed $n$-manifolds with some
bounds for volumes, diameters, $L^{2}$-norms of bundle curvatures and
$L^{\frac{n}{2}}$-norms of curvature tensors. This result is a generalization
of earlier compactness theorems for Einstein manifolds.
