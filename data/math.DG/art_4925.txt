The inverse surfaces of tangent developables with respect to s_{c}(r)
In this paper, we define the inverse surface of a tangent developable surface
with respect to the sphere S_{c}(r) with the center $c\in \mathbb{E}^{3}$ and
the radius r in 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{3}$. We obtain the
curvatures, the Christoffel symbols and the shape operator of this inverse
surface by the help of these of the tangent developable surface. Morever, we
give some necessary and sufficient conditions regarding the inverse surface
being flat and minimal.
