Finiteness theorems for equifocal hypersurfaces
In this paper, we give a finiteness result on the diffeomorphism types of
curvature-adapted equifocal hypersurfaces in a simply connected compact
symmetric space. Furthermore, the condition curvature-adapted can be dropped if
the symmetric space is of rank one.
