The volume of KÃ¤hler-Einstein Fano varieties and convex bodies
We show that the complex projective space has maximal degree (volume) among
all n-dimensional Kahler-Einstein Fano manifolds admitting a holomorphic
C^*-action with a finite number of fixed points. The toric version of this
result, translated to the realm of convex geometry, thus confirms Ehrhart's
volume conjecture for a large class of rational polytopes, including duals of
lattice polytopes. The case of spherical varieties/multiplicity free symplectic
manifolds is also discussed. The proof uses Moser-Trudinger type inequalities
for Stein domains and also leads to criticality results for mean field type
equations in C^n of independent interest. The paper supersedes our previous
preprint concerning the case of toric Fano manifolds.
