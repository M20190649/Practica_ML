The curvature tensor of almost cosymplectic and almost Kenmotsu
  (κ,μ,ν)-spaces
We study the Riemann curvature tensor of (\kappa,\mu,\nu)-spaces when they
have almost cosymplectic and almost Kenmotsu structures, giving its writing
explicitly. This leads to the definition and study of a natural generalisation
of the contact metric (\kappa,\mu,\nu)-spaces. We present examples or
obstruction results of these spaces in all possible cases.
