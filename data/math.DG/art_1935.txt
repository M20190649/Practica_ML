Uniform Estimates for the Constant Mean Curvature Solutions of the
  Vacuum Einstein Constraint Equations on Compact Manifolds
We give some uniform estimates for constant mean curvature solutions of the
conformal vacuum Einstein constraint equations on compact manifolds. Existence
of those solutions was given in a paper by J. Isenberg.
