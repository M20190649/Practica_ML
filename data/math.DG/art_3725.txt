Convergence of the parabolic complex Monge-Amp√®re equation on compact
  Hermitian manifolds
We prove $C^\infty$ convergence for suitably normalized solutions of the
parabolic complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation on compact Hermitian manifolds. This
provides a parabolic proof of a recent result of Tosatti and Weinkove.
