On the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator acting on forms of
  a Euclidean domain
We compute the whole spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator acting on
differential p-forms on the unit Euclidean ball. Then, we prove a new upper
bound for its first eigenvalue on a domain $\Omega$ in Euclidean space in terms
of the isoperimetric ratio ${\rm Vol}(\bd\Omega)/{\rm Vol}(\Omega)$.
