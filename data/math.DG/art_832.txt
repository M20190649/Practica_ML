Minimal Lagrangian 2-tori in CP^2 come in real families of every
  dimension
We show that for every non-negative integer n there is a real n-dimensional
family of minimal Lagrangian tori in CP^2, and hence of special Lagrangian
cones in C^3 whose link is a torus. The proof utilises the fact that such tori
arise from integrable systems, and can be described using algebro-geometric
(spectral curve) data.
