The geometry of product conjugate connections
Properties of pairs of product conjugate connections are stated with a
special view towards the integrability of the given almost product structure.
We define the analogous in product geometry of the structural and the virtual
tensors from the Hermitian geometry and express the product conjugate
connections in terms of these tensors. Some examples from the geometry of a
pair of complementary distributions are discussed and for this case the above
structural and virtual tensors are expressed in terms of O'Neill-Gray tensor
fields.
