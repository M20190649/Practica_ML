Symmetries of trivial systems of ODEs of mixed order
We compute symmetry algebras of a system of two equations y^(k)=z^(l)=0,
where 2<=k<l. It appears that there are many ways to convert such system of
ODEs to an exterior differential system. They lead to different series of
finite-dimensional symmetry algebras. For example, for (k,l)=(2,3) we get two
non-isomorphic symmetry algebras of the same dimension. We explore how these
symmetry algebras are related to both Sternberg prolongation of G-structures
and Tanaka prolongation of graded nilpotent Lie algebras.
  Surprisingly, the case (k,l)=(2,3) provides an example of a linear subalgebra
g in gl(5,R) such that the Sternberg prolongations of g and g^t are both of the
same dimension, but are non-isomorphic.
  We also discuss the non-linear case and the link with flag structures on
smooth manifolds.
