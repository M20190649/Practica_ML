Lower Bounds for the Eigenvalues of the Dirac Operator on $Spin^c$
  Manifolds
In this paper, we extend the Hijazi inequality, involving the Energy-Momentum
tensor, for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on $Spin^c$ manifolds without
boundary. The limiting case is then studied and an example is given.
