Full description of totally geodesic unit vector fields on 2-dimensional
  Riemannian manifolds
We give a full geometrical description of local totally geodesic unit vector
field on Riemannian 2-manifold, considering the field as a local imbedding of
the manifold into its unit tangent bundle with the Sasaki metric.
