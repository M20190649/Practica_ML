On the extension of axially symmetric volume flow and mean curvature
  flow
We study the provenance of singularity formation under mean curvature flow
and volume preserving mean curvature flow in an axially symmetric setting. We
prove that if the mean curvature is uniformly bounded on any finite time
interval, then no singularities can develop during that time under both mean
curvature flow and volume preserving mean curvature flow.
