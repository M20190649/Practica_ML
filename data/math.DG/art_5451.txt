Singular Riemannian foliations and applications to positive and
  nonnegative curvature
We determine the structure of the fundamental group of the regular leaves of
a closed singular Riemannian foliation on a compact, simply connected
Riemannian manifold. We also study closed singular Riemannian foliations whose
leaves are homeomorphic to aspherical or to Bieberbach manifolds. These
foliations, which we call A-foliations and B-foliations, respectively,
generalize isometric torus actions on Riemannian manifolds. We apply our
results to the classification problem of compact, simply connected Riemannian
4- and 5-manifolds with positive or nonnegative sectional curvature.
