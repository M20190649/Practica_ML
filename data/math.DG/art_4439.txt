A conservation approach to helicoidal surfaces of constant mean
  curvature in R^3, S^3 and H^3
We develop a conservation law for constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces
introduced by Korevaar, Kusner and Solomon, and provide a converse, so as to
characterize CMC surfaces by a conservation law. We work with `twizzler'
construction, which applies a screw-motion to some base curve. We show that,
excluding cylinders, CMC helicoidal surfaces can be completely determined by a
first-order ODE of the base curve. Further, we demonstrate that in R^3 this
condition is equivalent to the treadmillsled characterization of helicoidal CMC
surfaces given by O. Perdomo.
