Extrinsic hyperspheres in manifolds with special holonomy
We describe extrinsic hyperspheres and totally geodesic hypersurfaces in
manifolds with special holonomy. In particular we prove the nonexistence of
extrinsic hyperspheres in quaternion-Kaehler manifolds. We develop a new
approach to extrinsic hyperspheres based on the classification of special
Killing forms.
