Harmonic tori in de Sitter spaces $S^{2n}_1$
We show that all superconformal harmonic immersions from genus one surfaces
into de Sitter spaces $ S ^ {2n}_1 $ with globally defined harmonic sequence
are of finite-type and hence result merely from solving a pair of ordinary
differential equations. As an application, we prove that all Willmore tori in $
S ^ 3 $ without umbilic points can be constructed in this simple way.
