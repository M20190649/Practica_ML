The Moser-Trudinger inequality on Kahler-Einstein manifolds
We prove the conjecture of Tian on the strong form of the Moser-Trudinger
inequality for Kahler-Einstein manifolds with positive first Chern class, when
there are no holomorphic vector fields, and, more generally, when the setting
is invariant under a maximal compact subgroup of the automorphism group.
