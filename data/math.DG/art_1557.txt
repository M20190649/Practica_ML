Complex valued Ray-Singer torsion
In the spirit of Ray and Singer we define a complex valued analytic torsion
using non-selfadjoint Laplacians. We establish an anomaly formula which permits
to turn this into a topological invariant. Conjecturally this analytically
defined invariant computes the complex valued Reidemeister torsion, including
its phase. We establish this conjecture in some non-trivial situations.
