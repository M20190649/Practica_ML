Mean curvature and compactification of surfaces in a negatively curved
  Cartan-Hadamard manifold
We state and prove a Chern-Osserman-type inequality in terms of the volume
growth for complete surfaces with controlled mean curvature properly immersed
in a Cartan-Hadamard manifold $N$ with sectional curvatures bounded from above
by a negative quantity $K_{N}\leq b<0$
