Stability index jump for cmc hypersurfaces of spheres
It is known that the totally umbilical hypersurfaces in the (n+1)-dimensional
spheres are characterized as the only hypersurfaces with weak stability index
0. That is, a compact hypersurface with constant mean curvature, cmc, in
S^{n+1}, different from an Euclidean sphere, must have stability index greater
than or equal to 1. In this paper we prove that the weak stability index of any
non-totally umbilical compact hypersurface M\subset S^{n+1} with cmc cannot
take the values 1,2,3... n.
