Skew Killing spinors
In this paper, we study the existence of a skew Killing spinor (see the
definition below) on 2 and 3-dimensional Riemannian spin manifolds. We
establish the integrability conditions and prove that these spinor fields
correspond to twistor spinors in the two dimensional case while, up to a
conformal change of the metric, they correspond to parallel spinors in the
three dimensional case.
