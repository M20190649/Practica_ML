Bounding the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of a tube around a complex
  submanifold of $CP^n$ by the degrees of the polynomials defining it
We obtain upper bounds for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of a tube around a
complex submanifold $P$ of $CP^n$ which depends only on the radius of the tube,
the degrees of the polynomials defining $P$ and the first eigenvalue of some
model centers of the tube. The bounds are sharp on these models. Moreover, when
the models used are $CP^q$ or the complex hyperquadric, these bounds also give
gap phenomena and comparison results.
