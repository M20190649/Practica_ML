Enveloppes inferieures de fonctions admissibles sur l'espace projectif
  complexe. Cas dissymetrique
This paper generalizes the first author's preceding works concerning
admissible functions on certain Fano manifolds. Here, we study a larger class
of functions which can be less symmetric than the ones studied before. When the
sup of these functions is null, we prove that they admit a lower bound, giving
precisely Tian invariant on these manifolds.
