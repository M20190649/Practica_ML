3D-Algorithms of Composed Pursuit Navigation
The problem of pursuing a moving target is always one of the main topics in
navigation. In the literatures, there are two well-known algorithms called Pure
Pursuit and Pure Rendezvous navigation in the 3-dimensional space
$\mathbb{R}^3$. In this paper, these two methods are combined to introduce a
novel family of pursuing algorithms called Composed Pursuit Navigation. The
Kinematic and geometric properties of this navigation is studied. The
trajectories of this new family of algorithms benefit the advantages of two
known methods and its prominence is demonstrated in two real examples.
Moreover, it is shown that the metric related to the algorithms are given by
Matsumoto metrics.
