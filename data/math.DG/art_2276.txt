Structure theorems for embedded disks with mean curvature bounded in L^P
After appropriate normalizations an embedded disk whose second fundamental
form has large norm contains a multi-valued graph, provided the L^P norm of the
mean curvature is sufficiently small. This generalizes to non-minimal surfaces
a well known result of Colding and Minicozzi.
