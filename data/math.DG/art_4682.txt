Almost exponential maps and integrability results for a class of
  horizontally regular vector fields
We show a higher order integrability theorem for distributions generated by a
family of vector fields under a horizontal regularity assumption on their
coefficients. We use as chart a class of almost exponential maps which we
discuss in details
