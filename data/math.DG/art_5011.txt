Variation of complex structures and the stability of KÃ¤hler-Ricci
  Solitons
We investigate the linear stability of K\"ahler-Ricci solitons for
perturbations induced by varying the complex structure within a fixed K\"ahler
class. We calculate stability for the known examples of K\"ahler-Ricci
solitons.
