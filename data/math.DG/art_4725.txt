Scalar curvature and vector bundles
In the first part we use Gromov's K--area to define the K--area homology
which stabilizes into singular homology on the category of pairs of compact
smooth manifolds. The second part treats the questions of certain curvature
gaps. For instance, the $L^\infty $--curvature gap of complex vector bundles on
a compact manifold is positive if and only if the K--area homology coincides
with the reduced singular homology in all even degrees. In the third part we
give some upper bounds of the scalar curvature on compact manifolds. In
particular, we generalize results by Llarull and Goette, Semmelmann.
