The analogue of Wilczynski's projective frame in Lie sphere geometry:
  Lie-applicable surfaces and commuting Schr√∂dinger operators with magnetic
  fields
We propose a twistor construction of surfaces in Lie sphere geometry based on
the linear system which copies equations of Wilczynski's projective frame. In
the particular case of Lie-applicable surfaces this linear system describes
joint eigenfunctions of a pair of commuting Schr\"odinger operators with
magnetic fields.
