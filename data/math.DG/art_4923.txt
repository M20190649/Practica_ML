A note on Codazzi tensors
We discuss a gap in Besse's book, recently pointed out by Merton, which
concerns the classification of Riemannian manifolds admitting a Codazzi tensors
with exactly two distinct eigenvalues. For such manifolds, we prove a structure
theorem, without adding extra hypotheses and then we conclude with some
application of this theory to the classification of three-dimensional gradient
Ricci solitons.
