On the lower bound estimates of sections of the canonical bundle over a
  Riemann surface
In this paper, we give some estimates of the sum of the square norm of the
sections of the pluricanonical bundles over a Riemann surface with genus
greater than 2 and Gauss curvature (-1). Using these estimate, we give a
uniform estimate of the corona problem on Riemann surfaces.
