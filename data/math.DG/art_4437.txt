On the Mannheim Surface Offsets
In this paper, we study Mannheim surface offsets in dual space. By the aid of
the E. Study Mapping, we consider ruled surfaces as dual unit spherical curves
and define the Mannheim offsets of the ruled surfaces by means of dual geodesic
trihedron (dual Darboux frame). We obtain the relationships between the
invariants of Mannheim ruled surfaces. Furthermore, we give the conditions for
these surface offset to be developable. Furthermore, we obtained that the dual
spherical radius of curvature of offset surface is equal to dual offset angle.
