Special involute-evolute partner D-curves in E3
In this paper, we take into account the opinion of involute-evolute curves
which lie on fully surfaces and by taking into account the Darboux frames of
them we illustrate these curves as special involute-evolute partner D-curves in
E3. Besides, we find the relations between the normal curvatures, the geodesic
curvatures and the geodesic torsions of these curves. Finally, some
consequences and examples are given.
