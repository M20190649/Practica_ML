Hermitian structures on cotangent bundles of four dimensional solvable
  Lie groups
We study hermitian structures, with respect to the standard neutral metric on
the cotangent bundle $T^*G$ of a 2n-dimensional Lie group $G$, which are left
invariant with respect to the Lie group structure on $T^*G$ induced by the
coadjoint action. These are in one-to-one correspondence with left invariant
generalized complex structures on $G$. Using this correspondence and results of
Cavalcanti-Gualtieri and Fern\'andez-Gotay-Gray, it turns out that when $G$ is
nilpotent and four or six dimensional, the cotangent bundle $T^*G$ always has a
hermitian structure. However, we prove that if $G$ is a four dimensional
solvable Lie group admitting neither complex nor symplectic structures, then
$T^*G$ has no hermitian structure or, equivalently, $G$ has no left invariant
generalized complex structure.
