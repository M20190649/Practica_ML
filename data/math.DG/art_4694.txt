Biharmonic submanifolds in a Riemannian manifold with non-positive
  curvature
We show that for an isometric immersion of a complete Riemannian manifold
into a Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature, the norm of the mean
curvature vector field is square integrable, then it is minimal. This is a
partial affirmative answer of the B. Y. Chen's conjecture.
