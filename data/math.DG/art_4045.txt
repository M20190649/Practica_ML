Surfaces with parallel mean curvature in $\mathbb{S}^3\times\mathbb{R}$
  and $\mathbb{H}^3\times\mathbb{R}$
We prove a Simons type equation for non-minimal surfaces with parallel mean
curvature vector (pmc surfaces) in $M^3(c)\times\mathbb{R}$, where $M^3(c)$ is
a 3-dimensional space form. Then, we use this equation in order to characterize
certain complete non-minimal pmc surfaces.
