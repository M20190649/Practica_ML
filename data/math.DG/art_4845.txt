New examples of Willmore submanifolds in the unit sphere via
  isoparametric functions,II
This paper is a continuation of a paper with the same title of the last two
authors. In the first part of the present paper, we give a unified geometric
proof that both focal submanifolds of every isoparametric hypersurface in
spheres with four distinct principal curvatures are Willmore. In the second
part, we completely determine which focal submanifolds are Einstein except one
case.
