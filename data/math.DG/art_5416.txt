Minimal immersions of Riemannian manifolds in products of space forms
In this note, we give natural extensions to cylinders and tori of a classical
result due to T. Takahashi about minimal immersions into spheres. More
precisely, we deal with Euclidean isometric immersions whose projections in R^N
satisfy a spectral condition of their Laplacian.
