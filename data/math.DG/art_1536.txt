A Note on Doubly Warped Product Contact CR-Submanifolds in
  trans-Sasakian Manifolds
Warped product CR-submanifolds in Kaehlerian manifolds were intensively
studied only since 2001 after the impulse given by B.Y. Chen. Immediately
after, another line of research, similar to that concerning Sasakian geometry
as the odd dimensional version of Kaehlerian geometry, was developed, namely
warped product contact CR-submanifolds in Sasakian manifolds. In this note we
proved that there exists no proper doubly warped product contact
CR-submanifolds in trans-Sasakian manifolds.
