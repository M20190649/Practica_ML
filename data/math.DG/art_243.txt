Soliton equations in N-dimensions as exact reductions of Self-dual
  Yang-Mills equation III. Soliton geometry in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions
Some aspects of the relation between differential geometry of curves and
surfaces and multidimensional soliton equations is discussed. The connection
between multidimensional soliton equations and Self-dual Yang-Mills equation is
studied.
