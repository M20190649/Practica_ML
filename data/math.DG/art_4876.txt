Piecewise minimal surfaces interpolating between two real analytic
  curves
This paper is about interpolating minimal surfaces between two real analytic
curves, a and b, each of which are simple real analytic curves, using the
Bj\"{o}rling-Schwarz formula in the domain where it is valid, changing the
normal distributions on inital curves. We insert curves $l_1,...l_L$ at
specific locations and claim that there exists piecewise minimal surfaces
interpolating between $a$ to $l_1$,$l_2$ to $l_3$, ...$l_L$ to $b
