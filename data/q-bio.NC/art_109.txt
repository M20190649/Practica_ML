Face Recognition in the Machine Reveals Properties of Human Face
  Recognition
Psychophysical studies suggest that face recognition takes place in a narrow
band of low spatial frequencies (``critical band''). Here, we examined the
recognition performance of an artificial face recognition system as a function
of the size of the input images. Recognition performance was quantified with
three discriminability measures: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, non
Parametric Discriminant Analysis, and mutual information. All of the three
measures revealed a maximum at the same image sizes. Since spatial frequency
content is a function of image size, our data consistently predict the range of
psychophysical found frequencies. Our results therefore support the notion that
the critical band of spatial frequencies for face recognition in humans and
machines follows from inherent properties of face images.
