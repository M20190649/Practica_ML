Measuring information spatial densities
A novel definition of the stimulus-specific information is presented, which
is particularly useful when the stimuli constitute a continuous and metric set,
as for example, position in space. The approach allows one to build the spatial
information distribution of a given neural response. The method is applied to
the investigation of putative differences in the coding of position in
hippocampus and lateral septum.
