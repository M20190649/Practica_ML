Review: the development of neural stem cell biology and technology in
  regenerative medicine
In the middle of the last century, it has been known that neural stem cells
(NSCs) play a key role in regenerative medicine to cure the neurodegenerative
disease. This review article covers about the introduction to neural stem cell
biology and the isolation, differentiation and transplantation
methods/techniques of neural stem cells. The neural stem cells can be
transplanted into the human brain in the future to replace the damaged and dead
neurons. The highly limited access to embryonic stem cells and ethical issues
have escalated the search for other NSC sources. The developing technologies
are indicating that it can be achieved before the end of this century. In
addition, the differentiation and the maturation of NSCs can artificially
accelerate by modern methods.
