Synchronization in Electrically Coupled Neural Networks
In this report, we investigate the synchronization of temporal activity in an
electrically coupled neural network model. The electrical coupling is
established by homotypic static gap-junctions (Connexin 43). Two distinct
network topologies, namely: {\em sparse random network, (SRN)} and {\em fully
connected network, (FCN)} are used to establish the connectivity. The strength
of connectivity in the FCN is governed by the {\em mean gap junctional
conductance} ($\mu$). In the case of the SRN, the overall strength of
connectivity is governed by the {\em density of connections} ($\delta$) and the
connection strength between two neurons ($S_0$). The synchronization of the
network with increasing gap junctional strength and varying population sizes is
investigated. It was observed that the network {\em abruptly} makes a
transition from a weakly synchronized to a well synchronized regime when
($\delta$) or ($\mu$) exceeds a critical value. It was also observed that the
($\delta$, $\mu$) values used to achieve synchronization decreases with
increasing network size.
