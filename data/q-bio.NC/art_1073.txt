Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting
Network architecture forms a critical constraint on neuronal function. Here
we examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself,
in driving network-wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of
neuronal activity, we study how autaptic connections affect activity patterns,
and evaluate if neuronal degree or controllability are significant factors that
affect changes in bursting from these autaptic connections. We observed that
adding increasing numbers of autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
increased the number of spiking events in the network and the number of
network-wide bursts, particularly in the portion of the phase space in which
excitatory synapses were stronger contributors to bursting behavior than
inhibitory synapses. In comparison, autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
with high average controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding
the same number of self-looping connections to neurons with high modal
controllability. The number of autaptic connections required to induce bursting
behavior could be lowered by selectively adding autapses to high degree
excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic connections in
controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of
mammalian brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic
neurophysiological correlates of structural controllability.
