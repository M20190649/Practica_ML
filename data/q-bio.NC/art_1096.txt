On the quantum principles of cognitive learning
Pothos & Busemeyer's (P&B's) query about whether quantum probability can
provide a foundation for the cognitive modeling embodies so many underlying
implications that the subject is far from exhausted. In this brief commentary,
however, I suggest that the conceptual thresholds of the meaningful learning
give rise to a typical Boltzmann's weighting measure, which indicates a
statistical verisimilitude of quantum behavior in the human cognitive ensemble.
