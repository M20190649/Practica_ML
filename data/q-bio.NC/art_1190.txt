The Neuroscience of Spontaneous Thought: An Evolving, Interdisciplinary
  Field
An often-overlooked characteristic of the human mind is its propensity to
wander. Despite growing interest in the science of mind-wandering, most studies
operationalize mind-wandering by its task-unrelated contents, which may be
orthogonal to the processes constraining how thoughts are evoked and unfold
over time. In this chapter, we emphasize the importance of incorporating such
processes into current definitions of mind-wandering, and proposing that
mind-wandering and other forms of spontaneous thought (such as dreaming and
creativity) are mental states that arise and transition relatively freely due
to an absence of constraints on cognition. We review existing psychological,
philosophical, and neuroscientific research on spontaneous thought through the
lens of this framework, and call for additional research into the dynamic
properties of the mind and brain.
