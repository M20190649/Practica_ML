Data-Driven Predictive Modeling of Neuronal Dynamics using Long
  Short-Term Memory
Modeling brain dynamics to better understand and control complex behaviors
underlying various cognitive brain functions are of interests to engineers,
mathematicians, and physicists from the last several decades. With a motivation
of developing computationally efficient models of brain dynamics to use in
designing control-theoretic neurostimulation strategies, we have developed a
novel data-driven approach in a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network
architecture to predict the temporal dynamics of complex systems over an
extended long time-horizon in future. In contrast to recent LSTM-based
dynamical modeling approaches that make use of multi-layer perceptrons or
linear combination layers as output layers, our architecture uses a single
fully connected output layer and reversed-order sequence-to-sequence mapping to
improve short time-horizon prediction accuracy and to make multi-timestep
predictions of dynamical behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
in reconstructing the regular spiking to bursting dynamics exhibited by an
experimentally-validated 9-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley model of hippocampal CA1
pyramidal neurons. Through simulations, we show that our LSTM neural network
can predict the multi-time scale temporal dynamics underlying various spiking
patterns with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, our results show that the
predictions improve with increasing predictive time-horizon in the
multi-timestep deep LSTM neural network.
