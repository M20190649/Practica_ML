Unveiling Stimulation Secrets of Electrical Excitation of Neural Tissue
  Using a Circuit Probability Theory
A new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, is proposed to unveil the
secret of electrical nerve stimulation, essentially explain the nonlinear and
resonant phenomena observed when neural and non-neural tissues are electrically
stimulated. For the explanation of frequency dependent response, an inductor is
involved in the neural circuit model. Furthermore, predicted response to varied
stimulation strength is calculated stochastically. Based on this theory, many
empirical models, such as strength-duration relationship and LNP model, can be
theoretically explained, derived, and amended. This theory can explain the
complex nonlinear interactions in electrical stimulation and fit in vivo
experiment data on stimulation-responses of many experiments. As such, the C-P
theory should be able to guide novel experiments and more importantly, offer an
in-depth physical understanding of the neural tissue. As a promising neural
model, we can even further explore the more accurate circuit configuration and
probability equation to better describe the electrical stimulation of neural
tissues in the future.
