On the role of chemical synapses in coupled neurons with noise
We examine the behavior in the presence of noise of an array of Morris-Lecar
neurons coupled via chemical synapses. Special attention is devoted to
comparing this behavior with the better known case of electrical coupling
arising via gap junctions. In particular, our numerical simulations show that
chemical synapses are more efficient than gap junctions in enhancing coherence
at an optimal noise (what is known as array-enhanced coherence resonance): in
the case of (nonlinear) chemical coupling, we observe a substantial increase in
the stochastic coherence of the system, in comparison with (linear) electrical
coupling. We interpret this qualitative difference between both types of
coupling as arising from the fact that chemical synapses only act while the
presynaptic neuron is spiking, whereas gap junctions connect the voltage of the
two neurons at all times. This leads in the electrical coupling case to larger
correlations during interspike time intervals which are detrimental to the
array-enhanced coherence effect. Finally, we report on the existence of a
system-size coherence resonance in this locally coupled system, exhibited by
the average membrane potential of the array.
