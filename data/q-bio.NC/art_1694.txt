An interdisciplinary overview of developmental indices and behavioral
  measures of the minimal self
In this review paper we discuss the development of the minimal self in
humans, the behavioural measures indicating the presence of different aspects
of the minimal self, namely, body ownership and sense of agency, and also
discuss robotics research investigating and developing these concepts in
artificial agents. We investigate possible avenues for expanding the research
in robotics to further explore the development of an artificial minimal self.
