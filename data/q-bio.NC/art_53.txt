Postsynaptic mechanisms for the induction of long-term potentiation and
  long-term depression of synaptic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the
  hippocampus
The studies described in this dissertation have attempted to address the
cellular mechanisms of information storage by the brain. My work has focused
primarily on the postsynaptic events that occur during and after induction of
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at the Schaffer
collateral-CA1 synapse of the hippocampus. I have explored various aspects of
the role of postsynaptic Ca$^{2+}$ in the induction of LTP and LTD using both
extracellular and whole-cell recording techniques, as well as fluorescence
imaging of Ca$^{2+}$. I have also examined the possible role of modulation of
dendritic K$^{+}$ channels in the induction of LTP.
