FEM-based Scalp-to-Cortex data mapping via the solution of the Cauchy
  problem
We propose an approach and the numerical algorithm for pre-processing of the
electroencephalography (EEG) data, enabling to generate an accurate mapping of
the potential from the measurement area - scalp - to the brain surface. The
algorithm based on the solution of ill-posed Cauchy problem for the Laplace's
equation using tetrahedral finite elements linear approximation. Application of
the proposed algorithm sufficiently increases the spatial resolution of the EEG
technique, making it comparable with much more complicated electrocorticography
(ECoG) method.
