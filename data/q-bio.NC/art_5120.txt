Extreme value theory of evolving phenomena in complex dynamical systems:
  firing cascades in a model of neural network
We extend the scope of the dynamical theory of extreme values to cover
phenomena that do not happen instantaneously, but evolve over a finite, albeit
unknown at the onset, time interval. We consider complex dynamical systems,
composed of many individual subsystems linked by a network of interactions. As
a specific example of the general theory, a model of neural network, introduced
to describe the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, is analyzed in
detail: on the basis of this analysis we propose a novel definition of neuronal
cascade, a physiological phenomenon of primary importance. We derive extreme
value laws for the statistics of these cascades, both from the point of view of
exceedances (that satisfy critical scaling theory) and of block maxima.
