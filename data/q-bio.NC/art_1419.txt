Neurofeedback: principles, appraisal and outstanding issues
Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour
relationships.
