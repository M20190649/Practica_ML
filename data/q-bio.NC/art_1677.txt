When is now in a distributed system? Animated motion (could) set the
  present in brain networks
Our brains are viewed as interconnected distributed systems. The connections
between distant areas in the brain are significantly delayed. How to obtained
now in such networks with delayed interconnections? We aim to show that delayed
communication and interconnectedness of the brain impose an interaction with
the environment, assuming that such an access to now, which we label t-present,
is of use for this system. It is conjectured that for any sensory, motor or
cognitive functions to work efficiently an updated sort of time origin is
required, and we claim that it is uniquely given by a direct contact with the
physical environment. To get such contact autonomously any movement is
required, be it originating in the motion of sensory systems or in goal
directed movements. Some limit cases are identified and discussed. Next,
several testable situations are envisioned and available studies in favor of
the main theoretical hypothesis are shortly reviewed. Finally, as a proof of
concept, an experimental study employing galvanic vestibular stimulation is
presented and discussed.
