Statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions: large-scale EEG
  influences on molecular processes
Recent calculations further supports the premise that large-scale synchronous
firings of neurons may affect molecular processes. The context is scalp
electroencephalography (EEG) during short-term memory (STM) tasks. The
mechanism considered is $\mathbf{\Pi} = \mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units)
coupling, where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momenta of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves
$q$ the charge of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in units of the electron charge, and
$\mathbf{A}$ the magnetic vector potential of current $\mathbf{I}$ from
neuronal minicolumnar firings considered as wires, giving rise to EEG. Data has
processed using multiple graphs to identify sections of data to which
spline-Laplacian transformations are applied, to fit the statistical mechanics
of neocortical interactions (SMNI) model to EEG data, sensitive to synaptic
interactions subject to modification by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves.
