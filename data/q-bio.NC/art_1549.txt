Resting-state ASL : Toward an optimal sequence duration
Resting-state functional Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-fASL) in clinical daily
practice and academic research stay discreet compared to resting-state BOLD.
However, by giving direct access to cerebral blood flow maps, rs-fASL leads to
significant clinical subject scaled application as CBF can be considered as a
biomarker in common neuropathology. Our work here focuses on the link between
overall quality of rs-fASL and duration of acquisition. To this end, we
consider subject self-Default Mode Network (DMN), and assess DMN quality
depletion compared to a gold standard DMN depending on the duration of
acquisition.
