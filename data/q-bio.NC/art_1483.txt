MEG-Derived Functional Tractography, Results for Normal and Concussed
  Cohorts
Measures of neuroelectric activity from each of 18 automatically identified
white matter tracts were extracted from resting MEG recordings from a
normative, n=588, and a chronic TBI, traumatic brain injury, n=63, cohort, 60
of whose TBIs were mild. Activity in the TBI cohort was significantly reduced
compared with the norms for ten of the tracts, p < 10-6 for each. Significantly
reduced activity (p < 10-3) was seen in more than one tract in seven mTBI
individuals and one member of the normative cohort.
