Cholinergic switch between two types of slow waves in cerebral cortex
Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow
waves occurring under anesthetized states present no positive effects on
memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of
extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro and computational models. We find
two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive
slow-wave events. The first type of slow waves is seen during sleep, while the
second type prevails in anesthetized states. Network models of spiking neurons
predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on
inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency
adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between
the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation
strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a
neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show
that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external
stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia
differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between
slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.
