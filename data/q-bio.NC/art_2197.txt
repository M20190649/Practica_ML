Polarization Theory of Motivations, Emotions and Attention
A new theory of motivations, emotions and attention is suggested, considering
them as functions of sensory systems. The theory connects neurophysiological
mechanisms of mental phenomena with the change of metabolic and functional
state of perceptive neurons, which is reflected in the degree of polarization
of a cell membrane.
