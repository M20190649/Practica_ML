The Imaging Computational Microscope
The Imaging Computational Microscope (ICM) is a suite of computational tools
for automated analysis of functional imaging data that runs under the
cross-platform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.). ICM uses a
semi-supervised framework, in which at every stage of analysis computers handle
the routine work, which is then refined by user intervention. The main
functionality of ICM is built upon automated extraction of component signals
from imaging data, segmentation and clustering of component signals, and
feature computation and visualization. Analysis of imaging data through ICM can
also be done in real-time, enabling guided imaging experiments. ICM is built
using MATLAB's object-oriented class design, which allows the tool to be used
both as a graphic user interface (GUI) as well as in custom scripts. ICM is
freely available under the GNU public license for non-commerical use and open
source development, together with sample data, user tutorials and extensive
documentation.
