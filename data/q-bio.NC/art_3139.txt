Emotion Specification from Musical Stimuli: An EEG Study with AFA and
  DFA
The present study reports interesting findings in regard to emotional arousal
based activities while listening to two Hindustani classical ragas of contrast
emotion. EEG data was taken on 5 naive listeners while they listened to two
ragas Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray
contrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non
linear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the
two methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results
compared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of biosignal data. The
results and implications have been discussed in detail.
