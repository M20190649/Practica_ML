Generative models as parsimonious descriptions of sensorimotor loops
The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive processing and variational free
energy minimisation are typically used to describe perceptual processes based
on accurate generative models of the world. However, generative models need not
be veridical representations of the environment. We suggest that they can (and
should) be used to describe sensorimotor relationships relevant for behaviour
rather than precise accounts of the world.
