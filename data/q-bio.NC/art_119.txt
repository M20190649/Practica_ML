Brain as Quantum-like Machine for Transferring Time into Mind
We propose a model of processing of information in the brain which has the
following distinguishing features: a). It is quantum-like (QL). The brain uses
the quantum rule (given by von Neumann trace formula) for calculation of
averages for psychological functions. b). Those functions are considered as
self-observations of the brain. c). The QL-representation has the temporal
basis. The brain is a machine transferring time into cognition. d). Any
cognitive process is based on (at least) two time scales: precognitive time
scale (which is very fine) and cognitive time scale (which is essentially
coarser).
  To couple our model to physiology, behavioral science, and psychology, we
consider a number of known fundamental time scales in the brain. Although the
elaboration of those scales was based on advanced experimental research, there
are still many controversial approaches and results. The temporal structure of
the brain functioning is very complex.
