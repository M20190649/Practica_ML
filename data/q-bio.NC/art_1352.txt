Moral attitudes and willingness to induce cognitive enhancement and
  repair with brain stimulation
The availability of technological means to enhance and repair human cognitive
function raises questions about the perceived morality of their use. In this
study, we administered a survey to the public in which subjects were asked to
report how willing they would be to enhance and/or repair specific cognitive
abilities. Among 894 responders, we found that subjects were more willing to
use technologies to repair other people than themselves, and especially to
enhance or repair functions more "core" to authentic identity in others.
Subjects' ratings of the moral acceptability of specific uses was related to
their reported willingness to use brain stimulation. These findings suggest
that the public endorses an altruistic approach to applying brain stimulation
for cognitive gains. Further, this study establishes a basis to guide moral
psychological studies of cognitive modification and social processes that guide
attitudes toward and uses of brain stimulation.
