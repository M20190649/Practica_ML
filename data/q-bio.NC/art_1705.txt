Retroactive Interference Model of Power-Law Forgetting
Memory and forgetting constitute two sides of the same coin, and although the
first has been rigorously investigated, the latter is often overlooked. A
number of experiments under the realm of psychology and experimental
neuroscience have described the properties of forgetting in humans and animals,
showing that forgetting exhibits a power-law relationship with time. These
results indicate a counter-intuitive property of forgetting, namely that old
memories are more stable than younger ones. We have devised a phenomenological
model that is based on the principle of retroactive interference, driven by a
multi-dimensional valence measure for acquired memories. The model has only one
free integer parameter and can be solved analytically. We performed recognition
experiments with long streams of words were performed, resulting in a good
match to a five-dimensional version of the model.
