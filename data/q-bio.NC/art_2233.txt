The Complexity of Synaptic Transmission Revealed by a Multiscale
  Analysis Approach From The Molecular to The Cellular Level
Synaptic Transmission is a multiscale process, revealed by various
approaches, going from the molecular to the cellular level. This correspondence
points out to our recent contributions in this field. We now provide the
physical and mathematical foundation, leading to the rational quantification of
the analysis of the stochastic steps, underlying synaptic transmission.
