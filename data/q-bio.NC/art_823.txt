Causal-order superposition as an enabler of free will
It is often argued that bottom-up causation under a physicalist, reductionist
worldview precludes free will in the libertarian sense. On the one hand, the
paradigm of classical mechanics makes determinism inescapable, while on the
other, the leading models that allow a role for quantum effects are
noncommittal regarding how conscious agents are supposed to translate
indeterminacy into self-formed choice. Recent developments, however, not only
imply that self-formed decisions are possible, but actually suggest how they
might come about. The cornerstone appears to be causality superposition rather
than quantum-state entanglement, as is usually assumed, and the natural arena
for applying these developments is (perhaps ironically) a framework that was
built without any consideration for quantum effects.
