Motor skill learning by increasing the movement planning horizon
We investigated motor skill learning using a path tracking task, where human
subjects had to track various curved paths as fast as possible, in the absence
of any external perturbations. Subjects became better with practice, producing
faster and smoother movements even when tracking novel untrained paths. Using a
"searchlight" paradigm, where only a short segment of the path ahead of the
cursor was shown, we found that subjects with a higher tracking skill took a
longer chunk of the future path into account when computing the control policy
for the upcoming movement segment. We observed the same effects in a second
experiment where tracking speed was fixed and subjects were practicing to
increase their accuracy. These findings demonstrate that human subjects
increase their planning horizon when acquiring a motor skill.
