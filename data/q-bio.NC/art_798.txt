Transcranial Focused Ultrasound for BOLD fMRI Signal Modulation in
  Humans
Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging form of non-surgical
human neuromodulation that confers advantages over existing electro and
electromagnetic technologies by providing a superior spatial resolution on the
millimeter scale as well as the capability to target sub-cortical structures
non-invasively. An examination of the pairing of tFUS and blood oxygen level
dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) in humans is presented here.
