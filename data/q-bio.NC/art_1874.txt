Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a
  neural population
Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is
impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but
experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher order interactions
among large groups of elements play an important role. In the vertebrate
retina, we show that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with
strongly collective behavior in the responses of ten or more neurons.
Surprisingly, we find that this collective behavior is described quantitatively
by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher
order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising
models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by
correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or
error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such
behavior. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that
similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.
