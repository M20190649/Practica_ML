On the Origin of Tremor in Parkinson's Disease
The exact origin of tremor in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. We explain
why the existing data converge on the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop as a
tremor generator and consider a conductance-based model of subthalamo-pallidal
circuits embedded into a simplified representation of the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit to investigate the dynamics of this loop. We
show how variation of the strength of dopamine-modulated connections in the
basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop (representing the decreasing dopamine level
in Parkinson's disease) leads to the occurrence of tremor-like burst firing.
These tremor-like oscillations are suppressed when the connections are
modulated back to represent a higher dopamine level (as it would be the case in
dopaminergic therapy), as well as when the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop
is broken (as would be the case for ablative anti-parkinsonian surgeries).
Thus, the proposed model provides an explanation for the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop mechanism of tremor generation. The strengthening
of the loop leads to tremor oscillations, while the weakening or disconnection
of the loop suppresses them. The loop origin of parkinsonian tremor also
suggests that new tremor-suppression therapies may have anatomical targets in
different cortical and subcortical areas as long as they are within the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.
