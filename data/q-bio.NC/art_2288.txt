Response Selection Using Neural Phase Oscillators
In a recent paper, Suppes et al. (2012) [arXiv:arXiv:1010.3063] used neural
oscillators to create a model, based on reasonable neurophysiological
assumptions, of the behavioral stimulus-response (SR) theory. In this paper, we
describe the model in a less mathematical and more physical and intuitive way.
