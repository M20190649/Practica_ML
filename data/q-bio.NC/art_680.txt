Mechanistic Model to Replace Hodgkin-Huxley Equations
In this paper we construct a mathematical model for excitable membranes by
introducing circuit characteristics for ion pump, ion current activation, and
voltage-gating. The model is capable of reestablishing the Nernst resting
potentials, all-or-nothing action potentials, absolute refraction, anode break
excitation, and spike bursts. We propose to replace the Hodgkin-Huxley model by
our model as the basis template for neurons and excitable membranes.
