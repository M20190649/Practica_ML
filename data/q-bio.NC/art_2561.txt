Reduction of colored noise in excitable systems to white noise and
  dynamic boundary conditions
A recent study on the effect of colored driving noise on the escape from a
metastable state derives an analytic expression of the transfer function of the
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model subject to colored noise. Here we present
an alternative derivation of the results, taking into account time-dependent
boundary conditions explicitly. This systematic approach may facilitate future
extensions beyond first order perturbation theory. The analogy of the quantum
harmonic oscillator to the LIF neuron model subject to white noise enables a
derivation of the well known transfer function simpler than the original
approach. We offer a pedagogical presentation including all intermediate steps
of the calculations.
