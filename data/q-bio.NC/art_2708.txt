Modeling response time with power-law distributions
Understanding the properties of response time distributions is a
long-standing problem in cognitive science. We provide a tutorial overview of
several contemporary models that assume power law scaling is a plausible
description of the skewed heavy tails that are typically expressed in response
time distributions. We discuss several properties and markers of these
distribution functions that have implications for cognitive and
neurophysiological organization supporting a given cognitive activity. We
illustrate how a power law assumption suggests that collecting larger samples,
and combining individual subjects' data into a single set for a
distribution-function analysis allows for a better comparison of a group of
interest to a control group. We demonstrate our techniques in contrasts of
response time measurements of children with and without dyslexia.
