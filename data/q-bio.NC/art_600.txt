Integration of rule-based models and compartmental models of neurons
Synaptic plasticity depends on the interaction between electrical activity in
neurons and the synaptic proteome, the collection of over 1000 proteins in the
post-synaptic density (PSD) of synapses. To construct models of synaptic
plasticity with realistic numbers of proteins, we aim to combine rule-based
models of molecular interactions in the synaptic proteome with compartmental
models of the electrical activity of neurons. Rule-based models allow
interactions between the combinatorially large number of protein complexes in
the postsynaptic proteome to be expressed straightforwardly. Simulations of
rule-based models are stochastic and thus can deal with the small copy numbers
of proteins and complexes in the PSD. Compartmental models of neurons are
expressed as systems of coupled ordinary differential equations and solved
deterministically. We present an algorithm which incorporates stochastic
rule-based models into deterministic compartmental models and demonstrate an
implementation ("KappaNEURON") of this hybrid system using the SpatialKappa and
NEURON simulators.
