Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network
Recently spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received much attention because
of its rich biological significance and its power in processing spatial and
temporal information. However, most existing SNNs are static due to the fixed
eigenvalues of spiking generation functions, which means that neurons fire
spikes in a fixed frequency when receiving constant input signals. Thereby, the
static SNNs are limited in scalability. In this paper, we clarify the
bifurcation relationship that dynamic eigenvalues have a great influence on the
neuron excitation frequency. And then we propose the Bifurcation Spiking Neural
Network (BSNN) for developing a dynamic SNN. Different from traditional static
SNNs, BSNN takes a bifurcation system with time-varying eigenvalues as the
basic building block, thus it has more powerful flexibility and is able to
handle data with complex nonlinear structures. Experiments on wide-range tasks
have been conducted, including a delayed-memory XOR task, four image
recognition datasets, and 25 UCR archive. The results show that the performance
of BSNN is superior to the existing static SNN models.
