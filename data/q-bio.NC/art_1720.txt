Improved Hodgkin & Huxley-type model for action potentials in squid
By extending the crude Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz electrodiffusion model for
resting-state membrane potentials in perfused axons of squid we reformulate the
Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) phenomenological quantitative model to create a model which
is simpler, more quantitative, and based more fundamentally on electrodiffusion
principles. Our dynamical system, like that of HH, behaves as a 4-dimensional
resonator exhibiting subthreshold oscillations. Speeds of propagating action
potentials at 20 degrees Celsius are in very good agreement with the HH
experimental value at 18.5 degrees Celsius. Unlike its HH counterpart it does
not predict spike trains during prolonged constant-current stimulation, in
agreement with recent experiments. Our resonator model predicts rebound spiking
following prolonged hyperpolarizing stimulation, observed at 18.5 degrees
Celsius by HH but not predicted at this temperature by their quantitative
model. Spiking promoted by brief (0.1 ms) hyperpolarization is also predicted
at room temperature by our electrodiffusion model but only at much lower
temperatures (ca. 6 degrees Celsius) by the HH model. Such spiking in giant
axons induced directly by brief hyperpolarizing stimulation at room temperature
does not appear to have been investigated experimentally for either stationary
membrane action potentials or their propagating counterparts.
