A comparison of single-trial EEG classification and EEG-informed fMRI
  across three MR compatible EEG recording systems
Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to non-invasively measure the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain. One challenge is dealing with the
artifacts that each modality introduces into the other when the two are
recorded concurrently, for example the ballistocardiogram (BCG). We conducted a
preliminary comparison of three different MR compatible EEG recording systems
and assessed their performance in terms of single-trial classification of the
EEG when simultaneously collecting fMRI. We found tradeoffs across all three
systems, for example varied ease of setup and improved classification accuracy
with reference electrodes (REF) but not for pulse artifact subtraction (PAS) or
reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF).
