Physiologically Informed Bayesian Analysis of ASL fMRI Data
Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
data provides a quantitative measure of blood perfusion, that can be correlated
to neuronal activation. In contrast to BOLD measure, it is a direct measure of
cerebral blood flow. However, ASL data has a lower SNR and resolution so that
the recovery of the perfusion response of interest suffers from the
contamination by a stronger hemodynamic component in the ASL signal. In this
work we consider a model of both hemodynamic and perfusion components within
the ASL signal. A physiological link between these two components is analyzed
and used for a more accurate estimation of the perfusion response function in
particular in the usual ASL low SNR conditions.
