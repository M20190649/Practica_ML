Analog and digital codes in the brain
It has long been debated whether information in the brain is coded at the
rate of neuronal spiking or at the precise timing of single spikes. Although
this issue is essential to the understanding of neural signal processing, it is
not easily resolved because the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. We
suggest revising this coding issue so that one hypothesis is uniquely selected
for a given spike train. To this end, we decide whether the spike train is
likely to transmit a continuously varying analog signal or switching between
active and inactive states. The coding hypothesis is selected by comparing the
likelihood estimates yielded by empirical Bayes and hidden Markov models on
individual data. The analysis method is applicable to generic event sequences,
such as earthquakes, machine noises, human communications, and enhances the
gain in decoding signals and infers underlying activities.
