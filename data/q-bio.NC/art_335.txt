Synchronization with mismatched synaptic delays: A unique role of
  elastic neuronal latency
We show that the unavoidable increase in neuronal response latency to ongoing
stimulation serves as a nonuniform gradual stretching of neuronal circuit delay
loops and emerges as an essential mechanism in the formation of various types
of neuronal timers. Synchronization emerges as a transient phenomenon without
predefined precise matched synaptic delays. These findings are described in an
experimental procedure where conditioned stimulations were enforced on a
circuit of neurons embedded within a large-scale network of cortical cells
in-vitro, and are corroborated by neuronal simulations. They evidence a new
cortical timescale based on tens of microseconds stretching of neuronal circuit
delay loops per spike, and with realistic delays of a few milliseconds,
synchronization emerges for a finite fraction of neuronal circuit delays.
