Stride variability measures derived from wrist- and hip-worn
  accelerometers
Many epidemiological and clinical studies use accelerometry to objectively
measure physical activity using the activity counts, vector magnitude, or
number of steps. These measures use just a fraction of the information in the
raw accelerometry data as they are typically summarized at the minute level. To
address this problem we define and estimate two gait measures of temporal
stride-to-stride variability based on raw accelerometry data: Amplitude
Deviation (AD) and Phase Deviation (PD). We explore the sensitivity of our
approach to on-body placement of the accelerometer by comparing hip, left and
right wrist placements. We illustrate the approach by estimating AD and PD in
46 elderly participants in the Developmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study (DECOS)
who worn accelerometers during a 400 meter walk test. We also show that AD and
PD have a statistically significant association with the gait speed and
sit-to-stand test performance
