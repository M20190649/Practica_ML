Stress, Depression and Neuroplasticity
Modifications of signaling pathways and synapses owing to changing behaviors,
environments, numerous neural modulation as well as brain-tissue injuries is
defined as neuroplasticity in developmental neurology. The central purpose of
the review is to gain a better understanding of the relation between stress,
depression and neuroplasticity and explore potential therapeutic interventions
for enhancing neural resilience. We have also reviewed the role of different
factors like age, stress and sex on inducing neuroplasticity within various
brain regions.
