Computational analysis of laminar structure of the human cortex based on
  local neuron features
In this paper, we present a novel method for analysis and segmentation of
laminar structure of the cortex based on tissue characteristics whose change
across the gray matter facilitates distinction between cortical layers. We
develop and analyze features of individual neurons to investigate changes in
architectonic differentiation and present a novel high-performance, automated
tree-ensemble method trained on data manually labeled by three human
investigators. From the location and basic measures of neurons, more complex
features are developed and used in machine learning models for automatic
segmentation of cortical layers. Tree ensembles are used on data manually
labeled by three human experts. The most accurate classification results were
obtained by training three models separately and creating another ensemble by
combining probability outputs for final neuron layer classification.
Measurement of importances of developed neuron features on both global model
level and individual prediction level are obtained.
