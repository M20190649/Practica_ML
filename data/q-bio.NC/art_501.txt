Brain modularity controls the critical behavior of spontaneous activity
The human brain exhibits a complex structure made of scale-free highly
connected modules loosely interconnected by weaker links to form a small-world
network. These features appear in healthy patients whereas neurological
diseases often modify this structure. An important open question concerns the
role of brain modularity in sustaining the critical behaviour of spontaneous
activity. Here we analyse the neuronal activity of a model, successful in
reproducing on non-modular networks the scaling behaviour observed in
experimental data, on a modular network implementing the main statistical
features measured in human brain. We show that on a modular network, regardless
the strength of the synaptic connections or the modular size and number,
activity is never fully scale-free. Neuronal avalanches can invade different
modules which results in an activity depression, hindering further avalanche
propagation. Critical behaviour is solely recovered if inter-module connections
are added, modifying the modular into a more random structure.
