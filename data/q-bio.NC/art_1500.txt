Context-dependent architecture of brain state dynamics is explained by
  white matter connectivity and theories of network control
A diverse white matter network and finely tuned neuronal membrane properties
allow the brain to transition seamlessly between cognitive states. However, it
remains unclear how static structural connections guide the temporal
progression of large-scale brain activity patterns in different cogni- tive
states. Here, we deploy an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to define
brain states as time point level activity patterns from functional magnetic
resonance imaging data acquired dur- ing passive visual fixation (rest) and an
n-back working memory task. We find that brain states are composed of
interdigitated functional networks and exhibit context-dependent dynamics.
Using diffusion-weighted imaging acquired from the same subjects, we show that
structural connectivity constrains the temporal progression of brain states. We
also combine tools from network control theory with geometrically conservative
null models to demonstrate that brains are wired to sup- port states of high
activity in default mode areas, while requiring relatively low energy. Finally,
we show that brain state dynamics change throughout development and explain
working mem- ory performance. Overall, these results elucidate the structural
underpinnings of cognitively and developmentally relevant spatiotemporal brain
dynamics.
