Harnessing behavioral diversity to understand circuits for cognition
With the increasing acquisition of large-scale neural recordings comes the
challenge of inferring the computations they perform and understanding how
these give rise to behavior. Here, we review emerging conceptual and
technological advances that begin to address this challenge, garnering insights
from both biological and artificial neural networks. We argue that neural data
should be recorded during rich behavioral tasks, to model cognitive processes
and estimate latent behavioral variables. Careful quantification of animal
movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape
neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could serve as an important tool to connect
neural dynamics and rich behavioral data. ANNs have already begun to reveal how
particular behaviors can be optimally solved, generating hypotheses about how
observed neural activity might drive behavior and explaining diversity in
behavioral strategies.
