Suppression of neuronal phase synchronisation in cat cerebral cortex
We have studied effects of perturbations on the cat cerebral cortex.
According to the literature, this cortex structure can be described by a
clustered network. This way, we construct a clustered network with the same
number of areas as in the cat matrix, where each area is described as a
sub-network with small-world property. We focus on the suppression of neuronal
phase synchronisation considering different kinds of perturbations. Among the
various controlling interventions, we choose three methods: delayed feedback
control, external time-periodic driving, and activation of selected neurons. We
simulate these interventions to provide a procedure to suppress undesired and
pathological abnormal rhythms that can be associated with many forms of
synchronisation. In our simulations, we have verified that the efficiency of
synchronisation suppression by delayed feedback control is higher than external
time-periodic driving and activation of selected neurons for the cat cerebral
cortex with the same coupling strengths.
