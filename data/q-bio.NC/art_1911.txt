Universal properties of correlation transfer in integrate-and-fire
  neurons
One of the fundamental characteristics of a nonlinear system is how it
transfers correlations in its inputs to correlations in its outputs. This is
particularly important in the nervous system, where correlations between
spiking neurons are prominent. Using linear response and asymptotic methods for
pairs of unconnected integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons receiving white noise
inputs, we show that this correlation transfer depends on the output spike
firing rate in a strong, stereotyped manner, and is, surprisingly, almost
independent of the interspike variance. For cells receiving heterogeneous
inputs, we further show that correlation increases with the geometric mean
spiking rate in the same stereotyped manner, greatly extending the generality
of this relationship. We present an immediate consequence of this relationship
for population coding via tuning curves.
