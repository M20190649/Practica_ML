Auditory Brainstem Response in Infants and Children with Autism: A
  Meta-Analysis
Infants with autism were recently found to have prolonged Auditory Brainstem
Response (ABR); however, at older ages, findings are contradictory. We compared
ABR differences between participants with autism and controls with respect to
age using a meta-analysis. Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of
Science, Google Scholar, HOLLIS and ScienceDirect from their inception to June
2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727
participants with autism and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years.
Prolongation of wave V in autism had a significant negative correlation with
age (R2=0.23; P=.01). The 22 studies below age 18 years showed a significantly
prolonged wave V in autism (Standard Mean Difference=0.6 [95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8];
P<.001). The 3 studies above 18 years of age showed a significantly shorter
wave V in autism (SMD=-0.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.2]; P=.004). Prolonged ABR was
consistent in infants and children with autism, suggesting it can serve as an
autism biomarker at infancy. As the ABR is routinely used to screen infants for
hearing impairment, the opportunity for replication studies is extensive.
