Improving Motor Imagery Based Brain Computer Interfaces Using A Novel
  Physical Feedback Technique
In this project, and through an understanding of neuronal system
communication, A novel model serves as an assistive technology for locked-in
people suffering from Motor neuronal disease (MND) is proposed. Work was done
upon the potential of brain wave activity patterns to be detected as electrical
signals, classified and translated into commands following Brain Computer
Interfaces (BCI) constructing paradigm. However, the interface constructed was
for the first time a device which can reconstruct this command physically. The
project novelty is in the feedback step, where an electromagnets magnetic field
is used to showcase the command in ferrofluid droplets movement- these moved to
assigned targets due to rotation of a glass surface desk according to the data
received from the brain. The goal of this project is to address the challenges
of the inaccurate performance in user-training which is yet the main issues
preventing BCI from being upgraded into more applicable technology. Tests were
performed based on Open ViBE software after uploading recorded files of Motor
Imagery MI tasks and the design requirements tested were the motion speed of
the droplet and accuracy of hitting fixed targets. An average speed of 0.469
cm/s and average accuracy of 81.6% were obtained from the best volume for the
droplet. A conclusion to be drawn was that the promise of this other point of
view on BCI systems to be more Brain-Real World Systems
