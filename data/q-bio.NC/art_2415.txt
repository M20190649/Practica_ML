Applying Complexity Theory to a Dynamical Process Model of the
  Development of Pathological Belief Systems
A general dynamical process model of psychiatric disorders is proposed that
specifies the basic cognitive processes involved in the transition from beliefs
about self, others and world that are normal and adaptive, to beliefs that are
rigid, extreme, and maladaptive. The relevant thought trajectories are
self-confirming, and are considered to underlie the corresponding trajectories
in symptoms. In contrast with previous work, the model focuses on underlying
mechanisms, and it provides an evolutionary basis for the widespread
susceptibility to psychiatric symptoms and disorders without the problematic
claim that such disorders were selected by evolutionary forces. The model
thereby incorporates both normality and abnormality in the same framework.
