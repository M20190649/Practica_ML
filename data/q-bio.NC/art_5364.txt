Essential Motor Cortex Signal Processing: an ERP and functional
  connectivity MATLAB toolbox -- User Guide
The purpose of this document is to help individuals use the "Essential Motor
Cortex Signal Processing MATLAB Toolbox". The toolbox implements various
methods for three major aspects of investigating human motor cortex from
Neuroscience view point: (1) ERP estimation and quantification, (2) Cortical
Functional Connectivity analysis and (3) EMG quantification. The toolbox --
which is distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set
of MATLAB R routines -- can be downloaded directly at the address:
http://oset.ir/category.php?dir=Tools or from the public repository on GitHub,
at address below: https://github.com/EsiSeraj/ERP Connectivity EMG Analysis
  The purpose of this toolbox is threefold: 1. Extract the
event-related-potential (ERP) from preprocessed cerebral signals (i.e. EEG,
MEG, etc.), identify and then quantify the event-related
synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) events. Both time-course dynamics
and time-frequency (TF) analyzes are included. 2. Measure, quantify and
demonstrate the cortical functional connectivity (CFC) across scalp electrodes.
These set of functions can also be applied to various types of cerebral signals
(i.e. electric and magnetic). 3. Quantify electromyogram (EMG) recorded from
active muscles during performing motor tasks.
