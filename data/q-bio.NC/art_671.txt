Phase-of-firing code
Definition. The phase-of-firing code is a neural coding scheme whereby
neurons encode information using the time at which they fire spikes within a
cycle of the ongoing oscillatory pattern of network activity. This coding
scheme may allow neurons to use their temporal pattern of spikes to encode
information that is not encoded in their firing rate.
