Quasi-patterns produced by a Mexican Hat coupling of quasi-cycles
A family of stochastic processes has quasi-cycle oscillations if its
otherwise-damped oscillations are sustained by noise. Such a family forms the
reaction part of a stochastic reaction-diffusion system when we insert a local
Mexican Hat-type, difference of Gaussians, coupling on a one-dimensional and on
a two-dimensional lattice. We find spatial patterns of oscillating quasi-cycles
that resemble Turing patterns, called quasi-patterns. Specific properties of
these patterns, such as local phase synchronization, can be predicted from the
parameters of the reaction and of the Mexican Hat coupling. When the damping
parameters of the reaction and diffusion parts are small and balanced, phase
synchronization vanishes but amplitude patterns persist. These results extend
our knowledge of the behaviour of coupled neural field equations and its
dependence on stochastic fluctuations.
