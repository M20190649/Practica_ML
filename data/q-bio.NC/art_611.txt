Bootstrap testing for cross-correlation under low firing activity
A new cross-correlation synchrony index for neural activity is proposed. The
index is based on the integration of the kernel estimation of the
cross-correlation function. It is used to test for the dynamic synchronization
levels of spontaneous neural activity under two induced brain states:
sleep-like and awake-like. Two bootstrap resampling plans are proposed to
approximate the distribution of the test statistics. The results of the first
bootstrap method indicate that it is useful to discern significant differences
in the synchronization dynamics of brain states characterized by a neural
activity with low firing rate. The second bootstrap method is useful to unveil
subtle differences in the synchronization levels of the awake-like state,
depending on the activation pathway.
