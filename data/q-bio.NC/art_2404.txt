Inference Methods for Interaction and Noise Intensities Using Only
  Spike-time Data on Coupled Oscillators
We propose theoretical methods to infer coupling strength and noise intensity
simultaneously through an observation of spike timing in two well-synchronized
noisy oscillators. A phase oscillator model is applied to derive formulae
relating each of the parameters to some statistics from spike-time data. Using
these formulae, each parameter is inferred from a specific set of statistics.
We demonstrate the methods with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model as well as the phase
model. Our methods do not require any external perturbation and thus are ready
for application to various experimental systems.
