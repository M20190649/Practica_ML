How does Spreading Depression Spread? - Physiology and Modeling
Spreading depression (SD) is a wave phenomenon in gray matter tissue.
Locally, it is characterized by massive re-distribution of ions across cell
membranes. As a consequence, there is a sustained membrane depolarization and
tissue polarization that depresses any normal electrical activity. Despite
these dramatic cortical events, SD remains difficult to observe in humans
noninvasively, which for long has slowed advances in this field. The growing
appreciation of its clinical importance in migraine and stroke is therefore
consistent with an increasing need for computational methods that tackle the
complexity of the problem at multiple levels. In this review, we focus on
mathematical tools to investigate the question of spread and its two
complementary aspects: What are the physiological mechanisms and what is the
spatial extent of SD in the cortex? This review discusses two types of models
used to study these two questions, namely Hodgkin-Huxley type and generic
activator-inhibitor models, and the recent advances in techniques to link them.
