Computational implementation of the inverse continuous wavelet transform
  without a requirement of the admissibility condition
Recently, it has been proven [R. Soc. Open Sci. 1 (2014) 140124] that the
continuous wavelet transform with non-admissible kernels (approximate wavelets)
allows for an existence of the exact inverse transform. Here we consider the
computational possibility for the realization of this approach. We provide
modified simpler explanation of the reconstruction formula, restricted on the
practical case of real valued finite (or periodic/periodized) samples and the
standard (restricted) Morlet wavelet as a practically important example of an
approximate wavelet. The provided examples of applications includes the test
function and the non-stationary electro-physical signals arising in the problem
of neuroscience.
