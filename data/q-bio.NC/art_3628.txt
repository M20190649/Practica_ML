Brain Controllability: not a slam dunk yet
In our recent article (Tu et al., Warnings and caveats in brain
controllability, arXiv:1705.08261) we provided quantitative evidence to show
that there are warnings and caveats in the way Gu and collaborators (Gu et al.
Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6 (2015):
8414) define brain controllability. The comment by Pasqualetti et al.
(Pasqualetti et al. RE: Warnings and Caveats in Brain Controllability.
NeuroImage 297 (2019), 586-588) confirms the need to go beyond the methodology
and approach presented in Gu et al. original work. In fact, they recognize that
the source of confusion is due to the fact that assessing controllability via
numerical analysis typically leads to ill-conditioned problems, and thus often
generates results that are difficult to interpret. This is indeed the first
warning we discussed: our work was not meant to prove that brain networks are
not controllable from one node, rather we wished to highlight that the one node
controllability framework and all consequent results were not properly
justified based on the methodology presented in Gu et al. We used in our work
the same method of Gu et al. not because we believe it is the best methodology,
but because we extensively investigated it with the aim of replicating, testing
and extending their results. And the warning and caveats we have proposed are
the results of this investigation.
