Cortical Surface Parcellation using Spherical Convolutional Neural
  Networks
We present cortical surface parcellation using spherical deep convolutional
neural networks. Traditional multi-atlas cortical surface parcellation requires
inter-subject surface registration using geometric features with high
processing time on a single subject (2-3 hours). Moreover, even optimal surface
registration does not necessarily produce optimal cortical parcellation as
parcel boundaries are not fully matched to the geometric features. In this
context, a choice of training features is important for accurate cortical
parcellation. To utilize the networks efficiently, we propose cortical
parcellation-specific input data from an irregular and complicated structure of
cortical surfaces. To this end, we align ground-truth cortical parcel
boundaries and use their resulting deformation fields to generate new pairs of
deformed geometric features and parcellation maps. To extend the capability of
the networks, we then smoothly morph cortical geometric features and
parcellation maps using the intermediate deformation fields. We validate our
method on 427 adult brains for 49 labels. The experimental results show that
our method out-performs traditional multi-atlas and naive spherical U-Net
approaches, while achieving full cortical parcellation in less than a minute.
