Putting Mind Back into Nature: A Tribute to Henry P. Stapp
Henry Stapp has for 60 years been a leader, perhaps the leader, in exploring
the role of mind (psyche, consciousness, experience) in the ontology of quantum
mechanics. Henry's contention is that the very structure of quantum mechanics
implies a central and irreducible role for mind: an experiential aspect of
nature distinct from that of the physical matter and energy described by the
dynamical equations of physics. The task then becomes generating interest
across disciplines in the exploration of this thesis, and in particular to seek
connections with neuroscience and with empirical psychology.
