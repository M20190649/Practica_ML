Classification of Open and Closed Convex Codes on Five Neurons
Neural codes, represented as collections of binary strings, encode neural
activity and show relationships among stimuli. Certain neurons, called place
cells, have been shown experimentally to fire in convex regions in space. A
natural question to ask is: Which neural codes can arise as intersection
patterns of convex sets? While past research has established several criteria,
complete conditions for convexity are not yet known for codes with more than
four neurons. We classify all neural codes with five neurons as
convex/non-convex codes. Furthermore, we investigate which of these codes can
be represented by open versus closed convex sets. Interestingly, we find a code
which is an open but not closed convex code and demonstrate a minimal example
for this phenomenon.
