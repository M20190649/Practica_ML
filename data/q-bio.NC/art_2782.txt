Clinical and Educational Applications of LIVEIA: An Immersive
  Visualization Environment
The association between light and psychological states has a long history and
permeates our language. LIVEIA (Light-based Immersive Visualization Environment
for Imaginative Actualization) is a new immersive, interactive technology that
uses physical light as a metaphor for visualizing peoples' inner lives and
relationships. This paper outlines its educational value, as a tool for
understanding and explaining aspects of how people think and interact, and its
potential therapeutic value as a form of art therapy in which the artwork has
straightforwardly interpretable symbolic meanings.
