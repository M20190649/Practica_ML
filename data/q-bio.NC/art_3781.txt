Has the Brain Maximized its Information Storage Capacity?
Learning and memory may rely on the ability of neuronal circuits to
reorganize by dendritic spine remodeling. We have looked for geometrical
parameters of cortical circuits, which maximize information storage capacity
associated with this mechanism. In particular, we calculated optimal volume
fractions of various neuropil components. The optimal axonal and dendritic
volume fractions are not significantly different from anatomical measurements
in the mouse and rat neocortex, and the rat hippocampus. This has led us to
propose that the maximization of information storage capacity associated with
dendritic spine remodeling may have been an important driving force in the
evolution of the cortex.
