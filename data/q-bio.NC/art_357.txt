Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: a study of malnourished rats
Malnutrition is a main public health problem in developing countries.
Incidence is increasing and the mortality rate is still high. Malnutrition can
leads mayor problems that can be irreversible if it is present before brain
development is completed. We used BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent effect)
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to investigate the regions of brain
activity in malnourished rats. The food competition method was applied to a rat
model to provoke malnutrition during lactation. The weight increase is delayed
even if there is plenty milk available. To localize those regions of activity
resulting from the trigeminal nerve stimulation, the vibrissae-barrel axis was
employed due to the functional and morphological correlation between the
vibrissae and the barrels. BOLD response changes caused by the trigeminal nerve
stimulation on brain activity of malnourished and control rats were obtained at
7T. Results showed a major neuronal activity in malnourished rats on regions
like cerebellum, somatosensorial cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. This is
the first study in malnourished rats and illustrates BOLD activation in various
brain structures.
