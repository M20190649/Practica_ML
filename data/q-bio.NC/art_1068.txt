Next generation neural mass models
Neural mass models have been actively used since the 1970s to model the
coarse grained activity of large populations of neurons and synapses. They have
proven especially useful in understanding brain rhythms. However, although
motivated by neurobiological considerations they are phenomenological in
nature, and cannot hope to recreate some of the rich repertoire of responses
seen in real neuronal tissue. In this chapter we consider the $\theta$-neuron
model that has recently been shown to admit to an exact mean-field description
for instantaneous pulsatile interactions. We show that the inclusion of a more
realistic synapse model leads to a mean-field model that has many of the
features of a neural mass model coupled to a further dynamical equation that
describes the evolution of network synchrony. A bifurcation analysis is used to
uncover the primary mechanism for generating oscillations at the single and two
population level. Numerical simulations also show that the phenomena of event
related synchronisation and desynchronisation are easily realised. Importantly
unlike its phenomenological counterpart this \textit{next generation neural
mass model} is an exact macroscopic description of an underlying microscopic
spiking neurodynamics, and is a natural candidate for use in future large scale
human brain simulations.
