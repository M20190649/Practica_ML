Heritability estimates on resting state fMRI data using the ENIGMA
  analysis pipeline
Big data initiatives such as the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through
Meta-Analysis consortium (ENIGMA), combine data collected by independent
studies worldwide to achieve more accurate estimates of effect sizes and more
reliable and reproducible outcomes. Such efforts require harmonized analyses
protocols to consistently extract phenotypes. Even so, challenges include wide
variability of fMRI protocols and scanner platforms; this leads to site-to-site
variance in quality, resolution and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). An
effective harmonization should provide optimal measures for data of different
qualities. We developed a multi-site rsfMRI analysis pipeline to allow research
groups around the world to process rsfMRI scans in a harmonized way, to extract
consistent and quantitative measurements of connectivity and to perform
coordinated statistical tests. We used the single-modality ENIGMA rsfMRI
pipeline based on model-free Marchenko-Pastor PCA based denoising to verify and
replicate findings of significant heritability of measures from resting state
networks. We analyzed two independent cohorts, GOBS (Genetics of Brain
Structure) and HCP (the Human Connectome Project), which collected data using
conventional and connectomics oriented fMRI protocols. We used seed-based
connectivity and dual-regression approaches to show that rsfMRI signal is
consistently heritable across twenty major functional network measures.
Heritability values of 20-40% were observed across both cohorts.
