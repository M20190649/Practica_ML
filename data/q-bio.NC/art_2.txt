Frequency control in synchronized networks of inhibitory neurons
We analyze the control of frequency for a synchronized inhibitory neuronal
network. The analysis is done for a reduced membrane model with a
biophysically-based synaptic influence. We argue that such a reduced model can
quantitatively capture the frequency behavior of a larger class of neuronal
models. We show that in different parameter regimes, the network frequency
depends in different ways on the intrinsic and synaptic time constants. Only in
one portion of the parameter space, called `phasic', is the network period
proportional to the synaptic decay time. These results are discussed in
connection with previous work of the authors, which showed that for mildly
heterogeneous networks, the synchrony breaks down, but coherence is preserved
much more for systems in the phasic regime than in the other regimes. These
results imply that for mildly heterogeneous networks, the existence of a
coherent rhythm implies a linear dependence of the network period on synaptic
decay time, and a much weaker dependence on the drive to the cells. We give
experimental evidence for this conclusion.
