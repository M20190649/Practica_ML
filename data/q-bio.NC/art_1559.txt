Numerical Frequency Transference Analysis of a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
  Neuron
This work reports a transfer function-based approach to characterizing the
operation of single neuronal cells in terms of the instantaneous frequency of
the input and output signals. We adopt the leaky integrate-and-fire model. The
transfer function is obtained by performing successive numeric-computational
simulations and statistical regressions. Several interesting results are
reported, including the identification of linearity in the transfer functions,
as well as the identification of regions in the parameter space characterized
by sharper transfer functions.
