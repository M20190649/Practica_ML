Activity Modulation of Motor and Somatosensory Neurons in Learning
The cortical processes involved in learning are not well understood. Recent
experiments have studied population-level response in the orofacial
somatosensory (S1) and motor (S1) cortices of rhesus macaque monkeys during
adaptation to a simple tongue protrusion task within and across multiple
learning sessions. Initial findings have suggested the formation of cell
assemblies during adaptation. In this report we explore differences in cell
activity between successful and failed trials as the monkey learns during two
sessions. The ability to directly compare data across multiple sessions is
fairly new and until now research has mostly focused on the activity of neurons
during successful trials only. We confirm findings of the development of
coherently active cell assemblies and find that neural response differentiates
significantly between successful and unsuccessful trials, particularly as the
monkey adapts to the task. Our findings motivate further research into the
differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful trials in these
experiments.
