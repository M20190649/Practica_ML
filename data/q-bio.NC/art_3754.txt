Nonlinear Dynamics in Psychophysiology - Importance of Time Scales
Presented theory of feelings and emotions is based on Nonlinear Dynamics and
Theory of Complex Systems. The most important assumption is that the brain may
be considered to be composed of subsystems characterized by different
characteristic time scales. The theory explains a possible role of feelings and
emotions in cognition. We propose to call presented theory Chaosensology.
