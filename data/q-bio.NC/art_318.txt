Speed and Accuracy of Static Image Discrimination by Rats
When discriminating dynamic noisy sensory signals, human and primate subjects
achieve higher accuracy when they take more time to decide, an effect
attributed to accumulation of evidence over time to overcome neural noise. We
measured the speed and accuracy of twelve freely behaving rats discriminating
static, high contrast photographs of real-world objects for water reward in a
self-paced task. Response latency was longer in correct trials compared to
error trials. Discrimination accuracy increased with response latency over the
range of 500-1200ms. We used morphs between previously learned images to vary
the image similarity parametrically, and thereby modulate task difficulty from
ceiling to chance. Over this range we find that rats take more time before
responding in trials with more similar stimuli. We conclude that rats'
perceptual decisions improve with time even in the absence of temporal
information in the stimulus, and that rats modulate speed in response to
discrimination difficulty to balance speed and accuracy.
