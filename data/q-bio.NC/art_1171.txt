From the statistics of connectivity to the statistics of spike times in
  neuronal networks
An essential step toward understanding neural circuits is linking their
structure and their dynamics. In general, this relationship can be almost
arbitrarily complex. Recent theoretical work has, however, begun to identify
some broad principles underlying collective spiking activity in neural
circuits. The first is that local features of network connectivity can be
surprisingly effective in predicting global statistics of activity across a
network. The second is that, for the important case of large networks with
excitatory-inhibitory balance, correlated spiking persists or vanishes
depending on the spatial scales of recurrent and feedforward connectivity. We
close by showing how these ideas, together with plasticity rules, can help to
close the loop between network structure and activity statistics.
