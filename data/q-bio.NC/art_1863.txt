Synchronization and spindle oscillation in noisy
  integrate-and-fire-or-burst neurons with inhibitory coupling
We propose another integrate-and-fire model as a single neuron model. We
study a globally coupled noisy integrate-and-fire model with inhibitory
interaction using the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation, and
find a reentrant transition of oscillatory states. Intermittent time evolutions
of neuron firing are found in strongly inhibited systems. We propose another
integrate-and-fire-or-burst model including the dynamics of the low-threshold
Ca$^{2+}$ current based on the new integrate-and-fire model. We study a
globally coupled noisy integrate-and-fire-or-burst model with inhibitory
interaction using the Fokker-Planck equation, and find bistability of the tonic
mode and burst mode. Doubly periodic oscillation appears in a coupled system of
two neuron assemblies, which is similar to the spindle oscillation in thalamic
cells.
