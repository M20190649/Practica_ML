Functional Hubs in Mild Cognitive Impairment
We investigate how hubs of functional brain networks are modified as a result
of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition causing a slight but noticeable
decline in cognitive abilities, which sometimes precedes the onset of
Alzheimer's disease. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the
functional brain networks of a group of patients suffering from MCI and a
control group of healthy subjects, during the execution of a short-term memory
task. Couplings between brain sites were evaluated using synchronization
likelihood, from which a network of functional interdependencies was
constructed and the centrality, i.e. importance, of their nodes quantified. The
results showed that, with respect to healthy controls, MCI patients were
associated with decreases and increases in hub centrality respectively in
occipital and central scalp regions, supporting the hypothesis that MCI
modifies functional brain network topology, leading to more random structures.
