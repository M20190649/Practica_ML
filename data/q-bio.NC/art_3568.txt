Neural Codes and the Factor Complex
We introduce the factor complex of a neural code, and show how intervals and
maximal codewords are captured by the combinatorics of factor complexes. We use
these results to obtain algebraic and combinatorial characterizations of
max-intersection-complete codes, as well as a new combinatorial
characterization of intersection-complete codes.
