A Mathematical Model of Tripartite Synapse: Astrocyte Induced Synaptic
  Plasticity
In this paper we present a biologically detailed mathematical model of
tripartite synapses, where astrocytes modulate short-term synaptic plasticity.
The model consists of a pre-synaptic bouton, a post-synaptic dendritic
spine-head, a synaptic cleft and a peri-synaptic astrocyte controlling Ca2+
dynamics inside the synaptic bouton. This in turn controls glutamate release
dynamics in the cleft. As a consequence of this, glutamate concentration in the
cleft has been modeled, in which glutamate reuptake by astrocytes has also been
incorporated. Finally, dendritic spine-head dynamics has been modeled. As an
application, this model clearly shows synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal
region, i.e., astrocyte Ca2+ mediates synaptic plasticity, which is in
conformity with the majority of the recent findings (Perea & Araque, 2007;
Henneberger et al., 2010; Navarrete et al., 2012).
