A Unique Analytical Solution of the White Matter Standard Model using
  Linear and Planar Encodings
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in brain white matter probes
tissue microstructure and allows for the estimation of compartmental diffusion
parameters. Recently, it became apparent that traditional single-direction
diffusion encodings are not fully sufficient to resolve the white matter
compartmental diffusivities. Multiple diffusion encodings have been suggested
to make the problem less ambiguous, however, it still remained unclear whether
such protocols would completely solve the problem. Here, we constructively
prove that a combination of linear and planar diffusion encodings is enough to
determine the parameters of the three compartment white matter model.
