A guide to time-resolved and parameter-free measures of spike train
  synchrony
Measures of spike train synchrony have proven a valuable tool in both
experimental and computational neuroscience. Particularly useful are
time-resolved methods such as the ISI- and the SPIKE-distance, which have
already been applied in various bivariate and multivariate contexts. Recently,
SPIKE-Synchronization was proposed as another time-resolved synchronization
measure. It is based on Event-Synchronization and has a very intuitive
interpretation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the mathematical
properties of these three synchronization measures. For example, we were able
to obtain analytic expressions for the expectation values of the ISI-distance
and SPIKE-Synchronization for Poisson spike trains. For the SPIKE-distance we
present an empirical formula deduced from numerical evaluations. These
expectation values are crucial for interpreting the synchronization of spike
trains measured in experiments or numerical simulations, as they represent the
point of reference for fully randomized spike trains.
