Neural coding of a natural stimulus ensemble: Uncovering information at
  sub-millisecond resolution
Our knowledge of the sensory world is encoded by neurons in sequences of
discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is
persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these
spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using
the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. New
experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli,
comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic flight, and new
mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the
information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses
is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are
represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond
precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of ~60ms;
different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and
the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these
trajectories with high precision. Under these naturalistic conditions, the
system continues to transmit more information at higher photon flux, even
though individual photoreceptors are counting more than one million photons per
second, and removes redundancy in the stimulus to generate a more efficient
neural code.
