Damped oscillations of the probability of random events followed by
  absolute refractory period
Many events are followed by absolute refractoriness, when for some time after
the event a repetition of a similar event is impossible. If uniform events,
each of which is followed by the same period of absolute refractoriness, occur
randomly, as in the Bernoulli scheme, then the event probability as a function
of time exhibits damped oscillations. Here we give an exact analytical
description of the oscillations, with the focus on applying in neuroscience.
