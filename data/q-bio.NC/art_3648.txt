Effect of assistive method on the sense of fulfillment with agency:
  Modeling with flow and attribution theory
Several assistive technologies for users' operations have been recently
developed. A user's sense of agency (SoA) decreases with increasing system
assistance, possibly resulting in a decrease in the user's sense of
fulfillment. This study aims to provide a design guideline for an assistive
method to maintain and improve the sense of fulfillment with SoA. We propose a
mathematical model describing the mechanisms by which the assistive method
affects SoA and SoA induces a sense of fulfillment. The experience in the flow
state is assumed to be a sense of fulfillment. The assistance effect on the
skill-challenge plane in flow theory is defined as an increase in skill and
decrease in challenge. The factor that separates the two effects from
attribution theory is the locus of causality, which is matched to the judgement
of agency (JoA) from the two-step account of agency. We hypothesized that the
assistance increases the perception of skill and sense of fulfillment is
greater when the locus of causality is internal, rather than external. To
verify this hypothesis, a game task experiment was conducted with assistance
that varied with the ease of recognition. We hypothesized that a player's JoA
is internal for hard-to-recognize assistance, resulting in a high sense of
fulfillment. Experimental results supported this hypothesis.
