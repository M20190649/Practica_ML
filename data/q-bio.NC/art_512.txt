Rosetta Brains: A Strategy for Molecularly-Annotated Connectomics
We propose a neural connectomics strategy called Fluorescent In-Situ
Sequencing of Barcoded Individual Neuronal Connections (FISSEQ-BOINC),
leveraging fluorescent in situ nucleic acid sequencing in fixed tissue
(FISSEQ). FISSEQ-BOINC exhibits different properties from BOINC, which relies
on bulk nucleic acid sequencing. FISSEQ-BOINC could become a scalable approach
for mapping whole-mammalian-brain connectomes with rich molecular annotations.
