Structual Vulnerability of the Nematode Worm Neural Graph
The number of connected components and the size of the largest connected
component are studied under node and edge removal in the connectivity graph of
the C. elegans nervous system. By studying the two subgraphs - the directed
graph of chemical synapses and the undirected graph of electrical junctions -
we observe that adding a small number of undirected edges dramatically reduces
the number of components in the complete graph. Under random node and edge
removal, the C. elegans graph displays a remarkable structural robustness. We
then compare these results with the vulnerability of a number of canonical
graph models.
