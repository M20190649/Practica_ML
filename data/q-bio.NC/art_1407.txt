Seemless Utilization of Heterogeneous XSede Resources to Accelerate
  Processing of a High Value Functional Neuroimaging Dataset
We describe the technical effort used to process a voluminous high value
human neuroimaging dataset on the Open Science Grid with opportunistic use of
idle HPC resources to boost computing capacity more than 5-fold. With minimal
software development effort and no discernable competitive interference with
other HPC users, this effort delivered 15,000,000 core hours over 7 months.
