Equivalence between synaptic current dynamics and heterogeneous
  propagation delays in spiking neuron networks
Message passing between components of a distributed physical system is
non-instantaneous and contributes to determine the time scales of the emerging
collective dynamics like an effective inertia. In biological neuron networks
this inertia is due in part to local synaptic filtering of exchanged spikes,
and in part to the distribution of the axonal transmission delays. How
differently these two kinds of inertia affect the network dynamics is an open
issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the
non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field
dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the
population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the
hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory
allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed
inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model,
spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron
number is finite.
