Population Density Equations for Stochastic Processes with Memory
  Kernels
We present a novel method for solving population density equations (PDEs),
where the populations can be subject to non-Markov noise for arbitrary
distributions of jump sizes. The method combines recent developments in two
different disciplines that traditionally have had limited interaction:
computational neuroscience and the theory of random networks. The method uses a
geometric binning scheme, based on the method of characteristics, to capture
the deterministic neurodynamics of the population, separating the deterministic
and stochastic process cleanly. We can independently vary the choice of the
deterministic model and the model for the stochastic process, leading to a
highly modular numerical solution strategy. We demonstrate this by replacing
the Master equation implicit in many formulations of the PDE formalism, by a
generalization called the generalized Montroll-Weiss equation - a recent result
from random network theory - describing a random walker subject to transitions
realized by a non-Markovian process. We demonstrate the method for leaky- (LIF)
and quadratic-integrate and fire (QIF) neurons subject to spike trains with
Poisson and gamma distributed spike intervals. We are able to model jump
responses for both models accurately to both excitatory and inhibitory input
under the assumption that all inputs are generated by one renewal process.
