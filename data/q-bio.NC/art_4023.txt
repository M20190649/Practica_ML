Coherence stability and effect of random natural frequencies in
  populations of coupled oscillators
We consider the (noisy) Kuramoto model, that is a population of N
oscillators, or rotators, with mean-field interaction. Each oscillator has its
own randomly chosen natural frequency (quenched disorder) and it is stirred by
Brownian motion. In the limit N goes to infty this model is accurately
described by a (deterministic) Fokker-Planck equation. We study this equation
and obtain quantitatively sharp results in the limit of weak disorder. We show
that, in general, even when the natural frequencies have zero mean the
oscillators synchronize (for sufficiently strong interaction) around a common
rotating phase, whose frequency is sharply estimated. We also establish the
stability properties of these solutions (in fact, limit cycles). These results
are obtained by identifying the stable hyperbolic manifold of stationary
solutions of an associated non disordered model and by exploiting the
robustness of hyperbolic structures under suitable perturbations. When the
disorder distribution is symmetric the speed vanishes and there is a one
parameter family of stationary solutions : in this case we provide more precise
stability estimates. The methods we use apply beyond the Kuramoto model and we
develop here the case of active rotator models, that is the case in which the
dynamics of each rotator in absence of interaction and noise is not simply a
rotation.
