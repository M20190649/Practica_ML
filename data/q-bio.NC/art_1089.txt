Grand Challenges for Global Brain Sciences
The next grand challenges for society and science are in the brain sciences.
A collection of 60+ scientists from around the world, together with 10+
observers from national, private, and foundations, spent two days together
discussing the top challenges that we could solve as a global community in the
next decade. We eventually settled on three challenges, spanning anatomy,
physiology, and medicine. Addressing all three challenges requires novel
computational infrastructure. The group proposed the advent of The
International Brain Station (TIBS), to address these challenges, and launch
brain sciences to the next level of understanding.
