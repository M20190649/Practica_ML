Spatial representation of temporal information through spike timing
  dependent plasticity
We suggest a mechanism based on spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) of
synapses to store, retrieve and predict temporal sequences. The mechanism is
demonstrated in a model system of simplified integrate-and-fire type neurons
densely connected by STDP synapses. All synapses are modified according to the
so-called normal STDP rule observed in various real biological synapses. After
conditioning through repeated input of a limited number of of temporal
sequences the system is able to complete the temporal sequence upon receiving
the input of a fraction of them. This is an example of effective unsupervised
learning in an biologically realistic system. We investigate the dependence of
learning success on entrainment time, system size and presence of noise.
Possible applications include learning of motor sequences, recognition and
prediction of temporal sensory information in the visual as well as the
auditory system and late processing in the olfactory system of insects.
