What does the Allen Gene Expression Atlas tell us about mouse brain
  evolution?
We use the Allen Gene Expression Atlas (AGEA) and the OMA ortholog dataset to
investigate the evolution of mouse-brain neuroanatomy from the standpoint of
the molecular evolution of brain-specific genes. For each such gene, using the
phylogenetic tree for all fully sequenced species and the presence of orthologs
of the gene in these species, we construct and assign a discrete measure of
evolutionary age. The gene expression profile of all gene of similar age,
relative to the average gene expression profile, distinguish regions of the
brain that are over-represented in the corresponding evolutionary timescale. We
argue that the conclusions one can draw on evolution of twelve major brain
regions from such a molecular level analysis supplements existing knowledge of
mouse brain evolution and introduces new quantitative tools, especially for
comparative studies, when AGEA-like data sets for other species become
available. Using the functional role of the genes representational of a certain
evolutionary timescale and brain region we compare and contrast, wherever
possible, our observations with existing knowledge in evolutionary
neuroanatomy.
