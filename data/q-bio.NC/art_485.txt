Consciousness results when communication modifies the form of
  self-estimated fitness
The origin and development of consciousness is poorly understood. Although it
is clearly a naturalistic phenomenon evolved through Darwinian evolution,
explaining it in terms of physicochemical, neural, or symbolic mechanisms
remains elusive. Here I propose that two steps had to be taken in its
evolution. First, living systems evolved an intrinsic goal-directedness by
internalizing Darwinian fitness as a self-estimated fitness. The self-estimated
fitness participates in a feedback loop that effectively produces intrinsic
meaning in the organism. Second, animals with advanced nervous systems evolved
a special form of communication that modifies the way each partner estimates
fitness. The resulting change in intrinsic meaning is experienced subjectively
as a primary form of consciousness. This primary form is subsequently used to
generate, partly through internalized dialogue, more complex forms of
consciousness, such as consciousness of the natural and social worlds,
consciousness of the self, and language-dependent forms of consciousness.
