Differential flatness for neuroscience population dynamics -- A
  preliminary study
The present document is devoted to structural properties of neural population
dynamics and especially their differential flatness. Several applications of
differential flatness in the present context can be envisioned, among which:
trajectory tracking, feedforward to feedback switching, cyclic character,
positivity and boundedness.
