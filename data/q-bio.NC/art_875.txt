Evolving Network Model that Almost Regenerates Epileptic Data
In many realistic networks, the edges representing the interactions between
the nodes are time-varying. There is growing evidence that the complex network
that models the dynamics of the human brain has time-varying interconnections,
i.e., the network is evolving. Based on this evidence, we construct a patient
and data specific evolving network model (comprising discrete-time dynamical
systems) in which epileptic seizures or their terminations in the brain are
also determined by the nature of the time-varying interconnections between the
nodes. A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving
network model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense
that it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even upon presenting an
arbitrary initial condition to it. We illustrate a potential utility of our
methodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in
identifying an approximate seizure focus -- nodes in such a theoretically
determined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of
seizures. We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in
limiting seizures.
