A Mathematical model for Astrocytes mediated LTP at Single Hippocampal
  Synapses
Many contemporary studies have shown that astrocytes play a significant role
in modulating both short and long form of synaptic plasticity. There are very
few experimental models which elucidate the role of astrocyte over Long-term
Potentiation (LTP). Recently, Perea & Araque (2007) demonstrated a role of
astrocytes in induction of LTP at single hippocampal synapses. They suggested a
purely pre-synaptic basis for induction of this N-methyl-D- Aspartate (NMDA)
Receptor-independent LTP. Also, the mechanisms underlying this pre-synaptic
induction were not investigated. Here, in this article, we propose a
mathematical model for astrocyte modulated LTP which successfully emulates the
experimental findings of Perea & Araque (2007). Our study suggests the role of
retrograde messengers, possibly Nitric Oxide (NO), for this pre-synaptically
modulated LTP.
