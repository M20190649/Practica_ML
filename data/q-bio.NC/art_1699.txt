Models of Consciousness
The scientific study of consciousness is a new field which has emerged as a
response to groundbreaking developments in neuroscience, cognitive psychology
and analytic philosophy. Its aim is to develop a scientific account, formulated
in terms of formal mathematical laws or regularities, of how conscious
experience relates to the physical domain (e.g. to brain processes). Even
though several models of consciousness have been proposed in the literature,
details of the underlying conceptual terminology and formal framework remain
poorly understood. This paper aims to improve this situation by proposing a
grounding of the scientific study of consciousness which is based on a concise
definition of the object of investigation and gives rise to a clear-cut
mathematical framework for models of consciousness. Several examples are
studied and an application of this framework is given. The underlying
definitions are a further development of the grounding of the scientific study
of consciousness developed by David Chalmers and Thomas Nagel.
