A positive mood, a flexible brain
Flexible reconfiguration of human brain networks supports cognitive
flexibility and learning. However, modulating flexibility to enhance learning
requires an understanding of the relationship between flexibility and brain
state. In an unprecedented longitudinal data set, we investigate the
relationship between flexibility and mood, demonstrating that flexibility is
positively correlated with emotional state. Our results inform the modulation
of brain state to enhance response to training in health and injury.
