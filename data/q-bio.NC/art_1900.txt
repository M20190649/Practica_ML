Capacitance fluctuations causing channel noise reduction in stochastic
  Hodgkin-Huxley systems
Voltage-dependent ion channels determine the electric properties of axonal
cell membranes. They not only allow the passage of ions through the cell
membrane but also contribute to an additional charging of the cell membrane
resulting in the so-called capacitance loading. The switching of the channel
gates between an open and a closed configuration is intrinsically related to
the movement of gating charge within the cell membrane. At the beginning of an
action potential the transient gating current is opposite to the direction of
the current of sodium ions through the membrane. Therefore, the excitability is
expected to become reduced due to the influence of a gating current. Our
stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley like modeling takes into account both the channel
noise -- i.e. the fluctuations of the number of open ion channels -- and the
capacitance fluctuations that result from the dynamics of the gating charge. We
investigate the spiking dynamics of membrane patches of variable size and
analyze the statistics of the spontaneous spiking. As a main result, we find
that the gating currents yield a drastic reduction of the spontaneous spiking
rate for sufficiently large ion channel clusters. Consequently, this
demonstrates a prominent mechanism for channel noise reduction.
