Broadly heterogeneous network topology begets order-based representation
  by privileged neurons
How spiking activity reverberates through neuronal networks, how evoked and
spontaneous activity interact and blend, and how the combined activities
represent external stimulation are pivotal questions in neuroscience. We
simulated minimal models of unstructured spiking networks in silico, asking
whether and how gentle external stimulation might be subsequently reflected in
spontaneous activity fluctuations. Consistent with earlier findings in silico
and in vitro, we observe a privileged sub-population of 'pioneer neurons' that,
by their firing order, reliably encode previous external stimulation. We show
that the distinctive role of pioneer neurons is owed to a combination of
exceptional sensitivity to, and pronounced influence on, network activity. We
further show that broadly heterogeneous connection topology - a broad "middle
class" in degree of connectedness - not only increases the number of 'pioneer
neurons' in unstructured networks, but also renders the emergence of 'pioneer
neurons' more robust to changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. In
conclusion, we offer a minimal model for the emergence and representational
role of 'pioneer neurons', as observed experimentally in vitro. In addition, we
show how broadly heterogeneous connectivity can enhance the representational
capacity of unstructured networks.
