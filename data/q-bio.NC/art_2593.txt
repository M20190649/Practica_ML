Spatio-temporal patterns in multi-electrode array local field potential
  recordings
This paper presents a method for the detection of traveling waves of activity
in neural recordings from multi-electrode arrays. The method converts local
field potential measurements into the phase domain and fits a series of linear
models to find planar traveling waves of activity. Here I present the new
approach in the context of the previous work it extends, apply the approach to
data from neural recordings from a single animal, and verify the success of the
method on simulated data.
