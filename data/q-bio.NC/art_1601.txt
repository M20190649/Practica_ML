Cortical thickness and functional networks modules by cortical lobes
This study aims to investigate topological organization of cortical thickness
and functional networks by cortical lobes. First, I demonstrated modular
organization of these networks by the cortical surface frontal, temporal,
parietal and occipital divisions. Secondly, I mapped the overlapping edges of
cortical thickness and functional networks for positive and negative
correlations. Finally, I showed that overlapping positive edges map onto
within-lobe cortical interactions and negative onto between-lobes interactions.
