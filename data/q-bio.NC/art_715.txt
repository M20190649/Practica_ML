Stimulus-Dependent Frequency Modulation of Information Transmission in
  Neural Systems
Neural oscillations are universal phenomena and can be observed at different
levels of neural systems, from single neuron to macroscopic brain. The
frequency of those oscillations are related to the brain functions. However,
little is know about how the oscillating frequency of neural system affects
neural information transmission in them. In this paper, we investigated how the
signal processing in single neuron is modulated by subthreshold membrane
potential oscillation generated by upstream rhythmic neural activities. We
found that the high frequency oscillations facilitate the transferring of
strong signals, whereas slow oscillations the weak signals. Though the capacity
of information convey for weak signal is low in single neuron, it is greatly
enhanced when weak signals are transferred by multiple pathways with different
oscillation phases. We provided a simple phase plane analysis to explain the
mechanism for this stimulus-dependent frequency modulation in the leakage
integrate-and-fire neuron model. Those results provided a basic understanding
of how the brain could modulate its information processing simply through
oscillating frequency.
