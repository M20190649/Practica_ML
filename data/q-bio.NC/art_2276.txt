Self-organized stochastic tipping in slow-fast dynamical systems
Polyhomeostatic adaption occurs when evolving systems try to achieve a target
distribution function for certain dynamical parameters, a generalization of the
notion of homeostasis. Here we consider a single rate encoding leaky integrator
neuron model driven by white noise, adapting slowly its internal parameters,
the threshold and the gain, in order to achieve a given target distribution for
its time-average firing rate. For the case of sparse encoding, when the target
firing-rated distribution is bimodal, we observe the occurrence of spontaneous
quasi-periodic adaptive oscillations resulting from fast transition between two
quasi-stationary attractors. We interpret this behavior as self-organized
stochastic tipping, with noise driving the escape from the quasi-stationary
attractors.
