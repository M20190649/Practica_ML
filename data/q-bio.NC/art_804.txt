Emergence and Maintenance of Excitability: Kinetics over Structure
Emergence and maintenance of excitability is often phrased in terms of
arriving at and remaining about a manifold of 'solutions' embedded in a high
dimensional parameter space. Alongside studies that extend traditional focus on
control-based regulation of structural parameters (channel densities), there is
a budding interest in self-organization of kinetic parameters. In this picture,
ionic channels are continually forced by activity in-and-out of a large pool of
states not available for the mechanism of excitability. The process, acting on
expressed structure, provides a bed for generation of a spectrum of
excitability modes. Driven by microscopic fluctuations over a broad range of
temporal scales, self-organization of kinetic parameters extends the metaphors
and tools used in the study of development of excitability.
