Category specificity of N170 response recovery speeds for faces and
  Chinese characters
Neural selectivity of N170 responses is an important phenomenon in perceptual
processing; however, the recovery times of neural selective responses remain
unclear. In the present study, we used an adaptation paradigm to test the
recovery speeds of N170 responses to faces and Chinese characters. The results
showed that recovery of N170 responses elicited by faces occurred between 1400
and 1800 ms after stimuli onset, whereas recovery of N170 responses elicited by
Chinese characters occurred between 600 and 800 ms after stimuli onset. These
results demonstrate category-specific recovery speeds of N170 responses
involved in the processing of faces and Chinese characters.
