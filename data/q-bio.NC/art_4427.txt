Effects of time-delay in a model of intra- and inter-personal motor
  coordination
Motor coordination is an important feature of intra- and inter-personal
interactions, and several scenarios --- from finger tapping to human-computer
interfaces --- have been investigated experimentally. In the 1980, Haken, Kelso
and Bunz formulated a coupled nonlinear two-oscillator model, which has been
shown to describe many observed aspects of coordination tasks. We present here
a bifurcation study of this model, where we consider a delay in the coupling.
The delay is shown to have a significant effect on the observed dynamics. In
particular, we find a much larger degree of bistablility between in-phase and
anti-phase oscillations in the presence of a frequency detuning.
