Modelling axon growing using CTRW
The main goal of this study is to propose a mathematical model describing
paths of the axon growth cones and differences in the behavior of normal and
mutant axons. We introduce a probabilistic model for axon growing, such that
each family of axons is described as an ensemble of trajectories of a
continuous time random walk (CTRW) model under different parameters in the case
of normal and mutant axons. We describe different regimes in the model and
conclude how the behavior of axons depends on the parameters of the model.
Biological observations of the axonal growth process say us that the guiding
development of axons to their targets is operated by chemical signals from the
cellular environment. To simulate this control mechanism we propose the CTRW
model, where a random waiting time reflects a reaction time of the growth cones
on the neighboring chemical environment.
