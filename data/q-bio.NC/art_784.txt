Mapping Correlations of Psychological and Connectomical Properties of
  the Dataset of the Human Connectome Project with the Maximum Spanning Tree
  Method
We analyzed correlations between more than 700 psychological-, anatomical-
and connectome--properties, originated from the Human Connectome Project's
(HCP) 500-subject dataset. Apart from numerous natural correlations, which
describe parameters computable or approximable from one another, we have
discovered numerous significant correlations in the dataset, never described
before. We also have found correlations described very recently independently
from the HCP-dataset: e.g., between gambling behavior and the number of the
connections leaving the insula.
