A Macroscopic Behavioral Violation of No Signaling In Time Inequalities
In this paper we applied the no-signaling in time (NSIT) formalism discussed
by Kofler and Brukner to investigate temporal entanglement between binary human
behavioral unconscious choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2. NSIT
consists of a set of inequalities and represents mathematical conditions for
macro-realism which require only two measurements in time. The analyses of
three independent experiments show a strong violation of NSIT in two out of
three of them, supporting the hypothesis of a quantum-like temporal
entanglement between human choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2
