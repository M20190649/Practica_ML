A Review on Neural Network Models of Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum
  Disorder
This survey presents the most relevant neural network models of autism
spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, from the first connectionist models to
recent deep network architectures. We analyzed and compared the most
representative symptoms with its neural model counterpart, detailing the
alteration introduced in the network that generates each of the symptoms, and
identifying their strengths and weaknesses. For completeness we additionally
cross-compared Bayesian and free-energy approaches. Models of schizophrenia
mainly focused on hallucinations and delusional thoughts using neural
disconnections or inhibitory imbalance as the predominating alteration. Models
of autism rather focused on perceptual difficulties, mainly excessive attention
to environment details, implemented as excessive inhibitory connections or
increased sensory precision. We found an excessive tight view of the
psychopathologies around one specific and simplified effect, usually
constrained to the technical idiosyncrasy of the network used. Recent theories
and evidence on sensorimotor integration and body perception combined with
modern neural network architectures offer a broader and novel spectrum to
approach these psychopathologies, outlining the future research on neural
networks computational psychiatry, a powerful asset for understanding the inner
processes of the human brain.
