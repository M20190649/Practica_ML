Multistability, local pattern formation, and global collective firing in
  a small-world network of non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons
We investigate numerically the collective dynamical behavior of pulse-coupled
non-leaky integrate-and-fire-neurons that are arranged on a two-dimensional
small-world network. To ensure ongoing activity, we impose a probability for
spontaneous firing for each neuron. We study network dynamics evolving from
different sets of initial conditions in dependence on coupling strength and
rewiring probability. Beside a homogeneous equilibrium state for low coupling
strength, we observe different local patterns including cyclic waves, spiral
waves, and turbulent-like patterns, which -- depending on network parameters --
interfere with the global collective firing of the neurons. We attribute the
various network dynamics to distinct regimes in the parameter space. For the
same network parameters different network dynamics can be observed depending on
the set of initial conditions only. Such a multistable behavior and the
interplay between local pattern formation and global collective firing may be
attributable to the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological networks.
