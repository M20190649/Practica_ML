Processing of information in synchroneously firing chains in networks of
  neurons
The Abeles model of cortical activity assumes that in absence of stimulation
neural activity in zero order can be described by a Poisson process. Here the
model is extended to describe information processing by synfire chains within a
network of activity uncorrelated to the synfire chain. A quantitative
derivation of the transfer function from this concept is given.
