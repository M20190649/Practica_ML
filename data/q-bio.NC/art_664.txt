Power-law statistics and universal scaling in the absence of criticality
Critical states are sometimes identified experimentally through power-law
statistics or universal scaling functions. We show here that such features
naturally emerge from networks in self-sustained irregular regimes away from
criticality. In these regimes, statistical physics theory of large interacting
systems predict a regime where the nodes have independent and identically
distributed dynamics. We thus investigated the statistics of a system in which
units are replaced by independent stochastic surrogates, and found the same
power-law statistics, indicating that these are not sufficient to establish
criticality. We rather suggest that these are universal features of large-scale
networks when considered macroscopically. These results put caution on the
interpretation of scaling laws found in nature.
