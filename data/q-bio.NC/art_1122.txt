Cortical Brain Computer Interface for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation
Essential Tremor is the most common neurological movement disorder. This
progressive disease causes uncontrollable rhythmic motions -most often
affecting the patient's dominant upper extremity- that occur during volitional
movement and make it difficult for the patient to perform everyday tasks.
Medication may also become ineffective as the disorder progresses. For many
patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an effective means of
treating this condition when medication fails. In current use, however,
clinicians set the patient's stimulator to apply stimulation at all times-
whether it is needed or not. This practice leads to excess power use, and more
rapid depletion of batteries that require surgical replacement. In the work
described here, for the first time, neural sensing of movement (using
chronically-implanted cortical electrodes) is used to enable or disable
stimulation for tremor. Therapeutic stimulation is delivered only when the
patient is actively using their effected limb, thereby reducing the total
stimulation applied, and potentially extending the lifetime of
surgically-implanted batteries. This work, which involves both implanted and
external subsystems, paves the way for the future fully-implanted closed-loop
deep brain stimulators.
