Role of correlations in population coding
Correlations among spikes, both on the same neuron and across neurons, are
ubiquitous in the brain. For example cross-correlograms can have large peaks,
at least in the periphery, and smaller -- but still non-negligible -- ones in
cortex, and auto-correlograms almost always exhibit non-trivial temporal
structure at a range of timescales. Although this has been known for over forty
years, it's still not clear what role these correlations play in the brain --
and, indeed, whether they play any role at all. The goal of this chapter is to
shed light on this issue by reviewing some of the work on this subject.
