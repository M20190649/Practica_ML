Network properties of healthy and Alzheimer's brains
Small-world structures are often used to describe structural connections in
the brain. In this work, we compare the structural connection of cortical areas
of a healthy brain and a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease with artificial
small-world networks. Based on statistics analysis, we demonstrate that similar
small-world networks can be constructed using Newman-Watts procedure. The
network quantifiers of both structural matrices are identified inside the
probabilistic valley. Despite of similarities between structural connection
matrices and sampled small-world networks, increased assortativity can be found
in the Alzheimer brain. Our results indicate that network quantifiers can be
helpful to identify abnormalities in real structural connection matrices.
