A computational model revealing the effect of dopamine on action
  selection
In order to reveal the effect of nigrostriatal dopamine system on action
selection, first a computational model of the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus
loop is proposed and based on this model a simple compound model realizing the
Stroop effect is established. Even though Stroop task is mostly used to examine
selective attention, the main objective of this work is to investigate the
effect of action selection on Stroop task. The computational model of the
cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus loop is a non-linear dynamical system which is
not only capable of revealing the action selection property of basal ganglia
but also capable of modelling the effect of dopamine on action selection. While
the interpretation of action selection is based on the solutions of the
non-linear dynamical system, the effect of dopamine is modelled by a parameter
of the model. The inhibiting effect of dopamine on the habitual behaviour which
corresponds to word reading in Stroop task and letting the novel one occur
corresponding to colour naming is investigated using the compound computational
model established in this work.
