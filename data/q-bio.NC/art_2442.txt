Intrinsic Contextuality as the Crux of Consciousness
A stream of conscious experience is extremely contextual; it is impacted by
sensory stimuli, drives and emotions, and the web of associations that link,
directly or indirectly, the subject of experience to other elements of the
individual's worldview. The contextuality of one's conscious experience both
enhances and constrains the contextuality of one's behavior. Since we cannot
know first-hand the conscious experience of another, it is by way of behavioral
contextuality that we make judgements about whether or not, and to what extent,
a system is conscious. Thus we believe that a deep understanding of
contextuality is vital to the study of consciousness. Methods have been
developed for handling contextuality in the microworld of quantum particles.
Our goal has been to investigate the extent to which these methods can be used
to analyze contextuality in conscious experience. This work is the fledgling
efforts of a recently-initiated interdisciplinary collaboration.
