Modeling Interference-Free Neuron Spikes with Optogenetic Stimulation
This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method
to track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The
external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by a constant
current source that can be turned on or off. This paper considers firing
frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to
its resting potential after it fires. The time required for the neuron to
charge and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential are numerically
fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters and the input
current. Results show that simple functions of the model parameters and input
current can be used to predict the charging and recovery times, even when there
are deviations in the actual parameter values. Furthermore, the predictions
lead to lower bounds on the firing frequency that can be achieved without
significant distortion.
