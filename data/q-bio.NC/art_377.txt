Efficiency characterization of a large neuronal network: a causal
  information approach
When inhibitory neurons constitute about 40% of neurons they could have an
important antinociceptive role, as they would easily regulate the level of
activity of other neurons. We consider a simple network of cortical spiking
neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike timing dependent plasticity,
representative of a cortical column or hypercolumn with large proportion of
inhibitory neurons. Each neuron fires following a Hodgkin-Huxley like dynamics
and it is interconnected randomly to other neurons. The network dynamics is
investigated estimating Bandt and Pompe probability distribution function
associated to the interspike intervals and taking different degrees of
inter-connectivity across neurons. More specifically we take into account the
fine temporal ``structures'' of the complex neuronal signals not just by using
the probability distributions associated to the inter spike intervals, but
instead considering much more subtle measures accounting for their causal
information: the Shannon permutation entropy, Fisher permutation information
and permutation statistical complexity. This allows us to investigate how the
information of the system might saturate to a finite value as the degree of
inter-connectivity across neurons grows, inferring the emergent dynamical
properties of the system.
