An Efficient Coding Theory for a Dynamic Trajectory Predicts non-Uniform
  Allocation of Grid Cells to Modules in the Entorhinal Cortex
Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex encode the position of an animal in its
environment using spatially periodic tuning curves of varying periodicity.
Recent experiments established that these cells are functionally organized in
discrete modules with uniform grid spacing. Here we develop a theory for
efficient coding of position, which takes into account the temporal statistics
of the animal's motion. The theory predicts a sharp decrease of module
population sizes with grid spacing, in agreement with the trends seen in the
experimental data. We identify a simple scheme for readout of the grid cell
code by neural circuitry, that can match in accuracy the optimal Bayesian
decoder of the spikes. This readout scheme requires persistence over varying
timescales, ranging from ~1ms to ~1s, depending on the grid cell module. Our
results suggest that the brain employs an efficient representation of position
which takes advantage of the spatiotemporal statistics of the encoded variable,
in similarity to the principles that govern early sensory coding.
