Sequential sampling models in computational psychiatry: Bayesian
  parameter estimation, model selection and classification
Current psychiatric research is in crisis. In this review I will describe the
causes of this crisis and highlight recent efforts to overcome current
challenges. One particularly promising approach is the emerging field of
computational psychiatry. By using methods and insights from computational
cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry might enable us to move from a
symptom-based description of mental illness to descriptors based on objective
computational multidimensional functional variables. To exemplify this I will
survey recent efforts towards this goal. I will then describe a set of methods
that together form a toolbox of cognitive models to aid this research program.
At the core of this toolbox are sequential sampling models which have been used
to explain diverse cognitive neuroscience phenomena but have so far seen little
adoption in psychiatric research. I will then describe how these models can be
fitted to subject data and highlight how hierarchical Bayesian estimation
provides a rich framework with many desirable properties and benefits compared
to traditional optimization-based approaches. Finally, non-parametric Bayesian
methods provide general solutions to the problem of classifying mental illness
within this framework.
