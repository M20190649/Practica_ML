Spike statistics of stochastic homoclinic neuron models in the bistable
  region
Neurons typically show two distinct dynamical regimes: Resting state,
corresponding to a stable fixpoint, are often observed for low average input.
Higher input commonly result in tonic spiking, which corresponds to a stable
limit cycle. Some neurons, however, show an additional intermediate, bistable
regime, with coexistence of resting-state fixpoint and limit-cycle spiking. In
this article, a bistable neuron with spike onset at a saddle-homoclinic orbit
bifurcation is investigated. In the bistable region, noise can switch between
rest and spiking, and thus increase the variability of the spike train compared
to neurons with only one stable attractor. This has consequences for spike-time
coding as it effectively increases the output entropy of neuronal ensembles.
Here, the spiking statistics is derived for homoclinic conductance-based neuron
models. Switching between rest and spiking is mainly determined along the
downstroke of the action potential, a dynamical feature lacking in common
neuron models with reset dynamics. Nonetheless similar derivations can be
applied to quadratic integrate-and-fire models. The derived interspike interval
distribution is shown to be unimodal, which warrants the future use of
meanfield approaches to networks of bistable neurons.
