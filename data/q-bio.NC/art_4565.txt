Impact of noise and damage on collective dynamics of scale-free neuronal
  networks
We study the role of scale-free structure and noise in collective dynamics of
neuronal networks. For this purpose, we simulate and study analytically a
cortical circuit model with stochastic neurons. We compare collective neuronal
activity of networks with different topologies: classical random graphs and
scale-free networks. We show that, in scale-free networks with divergent second
moment of degree distribution, an influence of noise on neuronal activity is
strongly enhanced in comparison with networks with a finite second moment. A
very small noise level can stimulate spontaneous activity of a finite fraction
of neurons and sustained network oscillations. We demonstrate tolerance of
collective dynamics of the scale-free networks to random damage in a broad
range of the number of randomly removed excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A
random removal of neurons leads to gradual decrease of frequency of network
oscillations similar to the slowing-down of the alpha rhythm in Alzheimer's
disease. However, the networks are vulnerable to targeted attacks. A removal of
a few excitatory or inhibitory hubs can impair sustained network oscillations.
