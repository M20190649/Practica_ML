Chimera in a neuronal network model of the cat brain
Neuronal systems have been modeled by complex networks in different
description levels. Recently, it has been verified that networks can
simultaneously exhibit one coherent and other incoherent domain, known as
chimera states. In this work, we study the existence of chimera states in a
network considering the connectivity matrix based on the cat cerebral cortex.
The cerebral cortex of the cat can be separated in 65 cortical areas organised
into the four cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and
frontolimbic. We consider a network where the local dynamics is given by the
Hindmarsh-Rose model. The Hindmarsh-Rose equations are a well known model of
neuronal activity that has been considered to simulate membrane potential in
neuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as
well as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the
existence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of
desynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera
states with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with
desynchronised spikes.
