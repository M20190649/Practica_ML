Effects of dynamic synapses on noise-delayed response latency of a
  single neuron
Noise-delayed decay (NDD) phenomenon emerges when the first-spike latency of
a periodically forced stochastic neuron exhibits a maximum for a particular
range of noise intensity. Here, we investigate the latency response dynamics of
a single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron that is subject to both a suprathreshold
periodic stimulus and a background activity arriving through dynamic synapses.
We study the first spike latency response as a function of the presynaptic
firing rate f. This constitutes a more realistic scenario than previous works,
since f provides a suitable biophysically realistic parameter to control the
level of activity in actual neural systems. We first report on the emergence of
classical NDD behavior as a function of f for the limit of static synapses.
Secondly, we show that when short-term depression and facilitation mechanisms
are included at synapses, different NDD features can be found due to the their
modulatory effect on synaptic current fluctuations. For example a new
intriguing double NDD (DNDD) behavior occurs for different sets of relevant
synaptic parameters. Moreover, depending on the balance between synaptic
depression and synaptic facilitation, single NDD or DNDD can prevails, in such
a way that synaptic facilitation favors the emergence of DNDD whereas synaptic
depression favors the existence of single NDD. This is the first time it has
been reported the existence of DNDD effect in response latency dynamics of a
neuron.
