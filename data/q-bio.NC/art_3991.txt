Abnormal effective connectivity in migraine with aura under photic
  stimulation
Migraine patients with aura show a peculiar pattern of visual reactivity
compared with those of migraine patients without aura: an increased effective
connectivity, connected to a reduced synchronization among EEG channels, for
frequencies in the beta band. The effective connectivity is evaluated in terms
of the Granger causality. This anomalous response to visual stimuli may play a
crucial role in the progression of spreading depression and clinical evidences
of aura symptoms.
