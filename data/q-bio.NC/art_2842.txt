Vowel recognition with four coupled spin-torque nano-oscillators
Substantial evidence indicates that the brain uses principles of non-linear
dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with
nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical
nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations.
In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic
nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware
network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by
tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We
show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency
tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results
demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with
small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical
features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a
milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing.
