Localization of Brain Activity from EEG/MEG Using MV-PURE Framework
We consider the problem of localization of sources of brain electrical
activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
measurements using spatial filtering techniques. We propose novel reduced-rank
activity indices based on the minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank
estimation (MV-PURE) framework. The main results of this paper establish the
key unbiasedness property of the proposed indices and their higher spatial
resolution compared with full-rank indices in challenging task of localizing
closely positioned and possibly highly correlated sources, especially in low
signal-to-noise regime. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the
practical applicability of the proposed activity indices. Simulations presented
in this paper use open-source EEG/MEG spatial filtering framework freely
