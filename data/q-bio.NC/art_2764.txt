Assessing Executive Function Using a Computer Game: Computational
  Modeling of Cognitive Processes
Early and reliable detection of cognitive decline is one of the most
important challenges of current healthcare. In this project we developed an
approach whereby a frequently played computer game can be used to assess a
variety of cognitive processes and estimate the results of the pen-and-paper
Trail-Making Test (TMT) - known to measure executive function, as well as
visual pattern recognition, speed of processing, working memory, and
set-switching ability. We developed a computational model of the TMT based on a
decomposition of the test into several independent processes, each
characterized by a set of parameters that can be estimated from play of a
computer game designed to resemble the TMT. An empirical evaluation of the
model suggests that it is possible to use the game data to estimate the
parameters of the underlying cognitive processes and using the values of the
parameters to estimate the TMT performance. Cognitive measures and trends in
these measures can be used to identify individuals for further assessment, to
provide a mechanism for improving the early detection of neurological problems,
and to provide feedback and monitoring for cognitive interventions in the home.
