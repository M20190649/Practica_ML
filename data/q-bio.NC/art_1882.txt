On the use of analytic expressions for the voltage distribution to
  analyze intracellular recordings
Different analytic expressions for the membrane potential distribution of
membranes subject to synaptic noise have been proposed, and can be very helpful
to analyze experimental data. However, all of these expressions are either
approximations or limit cases, and it is not clear how they compare, and which
expression should be used in a given situation. In this note, we provide a
comparison of the different approximations available, with an aim to delineate
which expression is most suitable for analyzing experimental data.
