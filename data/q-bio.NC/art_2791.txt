The coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data
Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an area of growing interest in statistics. The
special characteristics of neuroimaging data render classical meta-analysis
methods inapplicable and therefore new methods have been developed. We review
existing methodologies, explaining the benefits and drawbacks of each. A
demonstration on a real dataset of emotion studies is included. We discuss some
still-open problems in the field to highlight the need for future research.
