SeizureNet: Multi-Spectral Deep Feature Learning for Seizure Type
  Classification
Automatic classification of epliptic seizure types in EEG datacould enable
more precise diagnosis and efficient manage-ment of the disease. Automatic
seizure type classificationusing clinical electroencephalograms (EEGs) is
challengingdue to factors such as low signal to noise ratios, signal
arte-facts, high variance in the seizure semiology among individ-ual epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data.To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present adeep learning based framework which
learns multi-spectralfeature embeddings using multiple CNN models in an
ensem-ble architecture for accurate cross-patient seizure type clas-sification.
Experiments on the recently released TUH EEGSeizure Corpus show that our
multi-spectral dense featurelearning produces a weighted f1 score of 0.98 for
seizure typeclassification setting new benchmarks on the dataset.
