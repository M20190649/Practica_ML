The impact of cancer on the neural activity
We study the impact of the decrease in the neural population on the neuronal
firing rate. We propose a cellular automaton model from cancerous growth in a
brain tissue and the death of neurons due absence of cells that help support to
neurons. We use this model to study how the firing rate changes when the
neuronal networks is under different external stimuli and the cancerous cells
have different proliferation rate. Our work shows that the cancer proliferation
decreases the neuronal firing rate.
