Towards Subject and Diagnostic Identifiability in the Alzheimer's
  Disease Spectrum based on Functional Connectomes
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only major cause of mortality in the world
without an effective disease modifying treatment. Evidence supporting the so
called disconnection hypothesis suggests that functional connectivity
biomarkers may have clinical potential for early detection of AD. However,
known issues with low test-retest reliability and signal to noise in functional
connectivity may prevent accuracy and subsequent predictive capacity. We
validate the utility of a novel principal component based diagnostic
identifiability framework to increase separation in functional connectivity
across the Alzheimer's spectrum by identifying and reconstructing FC using only
AD sensitive components or connectivity modes. We show that this framework (1)
increases test-retest correspondence and (2) allows for better separation, in
functional connectivity, of diagnostic groups both at the whole brain and
individual resting state network level. Finally, we evaluate a posteriori the
association between connectivity mode weights with longitudinal neurocognitive
outcomes.
