Dynamic changes in network synchrony reveal resting-state functional
  networks
Experimental fMRI studies have shown that spontaneous brain activity i.e. in
the absence of any external input, exhibit complex spatial and temporal
patterns of co-activity between segregated brain regions. These so-called
large-scale resting-state functional connectivity networks represent
dynamically organized neural assemblies interacting with each other in a
complex way. It has been suggested that looking at the dynamical properties of
complex patterns of brain functional co-activity may reveal neural mechanisms
underlying the dynamic changes in functional interactions. Here, we examine how
global network dynamics is shaped by different network configurations, derived
from realistic brain functional interactions. We focus on two main dynamics
measures: synchrony and variations in synchrony. Neural activity and the
inferred hemodynamic response of the network nodes are simulated using system
of 90 FitzHugh-Nagumo neural models subject to system noise and time-delayed
interactions. These models are embedded into the topology of the complex brain
functional interactions, whose architecture is additionally reduced to its main
structural pathways. In the simulated functional networks, patterns of
correlated regional activity clearly arise from dynamical properties that
maximize synchrony and variations in synchrony. Our results on the fast changes
of the level of the network synchrony also show how flexible changes in the
large-scale network dynamics could be.
