Dynamical model of sequential spatial memory: winnerless competition of
  patterns
We introduce a new biologically-motivated model of sequential spatial memory
which is based on the principle of winnerless competition (WLC). We implement
this mechanism in a two-layer neural network structure and present the learning
dynamics which leads to the formation of a WLC network. After learning, the
system is capable of associative retrieval of pre-recorded sequences of spatial
patterns.
