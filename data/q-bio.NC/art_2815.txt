GnRH induced Phase Synchrony of Coupled Neurons
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is reported to control mammalian
reproductive processes. GnRH a neurohormone which is pulsatile released into
the pituitary portal blood by hypothalamic GnRH neurons. In the present study,
the phase synchronization among a population of identical neurons subjected to
a pool of coupling molecules GnRH in extracellular medium via mean-field
coupling mechanism is investigated. In the model of populated neurons, GnRH is
considered to be autocrine signaling molecule and is taken to be common to all
neurons to act as synchronizing agent. The rate of synchrony is estimated
qualitatively and quantitatively by measuring phase locking values, time
evolution of the phase differences and recurrence plots. Our numerical results
show a phase transition like behavior separating the synchronized and
desynchronized regimes. We also investigated long range communication or relay
information transfer for one dimensional array of such neurons.
