Robust information propagation through noisy neural circuits
Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can
limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much
work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded
in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of
covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the
informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of
population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that
information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the
retina's performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the
optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the
spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of
processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of
covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of
information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal
family are covariances with "differential correlations", which are known to
reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus,
covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and
those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very
different.
