Swift Two-sample Test on High-dimensional Neural Spiking Data
To understand how neural networks process information, it is important to
investigate how neural network dynamics varies with respect to different
stimuli. One challenging task is to design efficient statistical approaches to
analyze multiple spike train data obtained from a short recording time. Based
on the development of high-dimensional statistical methods, it is able to deal
with data whose dimension is much larger than the sample size. However, these
methods often require statistically independent samples to start with, while
neural data are correlated over consecutive sampling time bins. We develop an
approach to pretreat neural data to become independent samples over time by
transferring the correlation of dynamics for each neuron in different sampling
time bins into the correlation of dynamics among different dimensions within
each sampling time bin. We verify the method using simulation data generated
from Integrate-and-fire neuron network models and a large-scale network model
of primary visual cortex within a short time, e.g., a few seconds. Our method
may offer experimenters to use the advantage of the development of statistical
methods to analyze high-dimensional neural data.
