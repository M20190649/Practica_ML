Incoherence-Mediated Remote Synchronization
In previously identified forms of remote synchronization between two nodes,
the intermediate portion of the network connecting the two nodes is not
synchronized with them but generally exhibits some coherent dynamics. Here we
report on a network phenomenon we call incoherence-mediated remote
synchronization (IMRS), in which two non-contiguous parts of the network are
identically synchronized while the dynamics of the intermediate part is
statistically and information-theoretically incoherent. We identify mirror
symmetry in the network structure as a mechanism allowing for such behavior,
and show that IMRS is robust against dynamical noise as well as against
parameter changes. IMRS may underlie neuronal information processing and
potentially lead to network solutions for encryption key distribution and
secure communication.
