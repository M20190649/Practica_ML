Natural movement with concurrent brain-computer interface control
  induces persistent dissociation of neural activity
As Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology develops it is likely it may be
incorporated into protocols that complement and supplement existing movements
of the user. Two possible scenarios for such a control could be: the increasing
interest to control artificial supernumerary prosthetics, or in cases following
brain injury where BCI can be incorporated alongside residual movements to
recover ability. In this study we explore the extent to which the human motor
cortex is able to concurrently control movements via a BCI and overtly executed
movements. Crucially both movement types are driven from the same cortical
site. With this we aim to dissociate the activity at this cortical site from
the movements being made and instead allow the representation and control for
the BCI to develop alongside motor cortex activity. We investigated both BCI
performance and its effect on the movement evoked potentials originally
associated with overt execution.
