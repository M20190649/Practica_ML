Dynamical Disequilibrium, Transformation, and the Evolution and
  Development of Sustainable Worldviews
This chapter begins by outlining a promising, new theoretical framework for
the process by which human culture evolves inspired by the views of complexity
theorists on the problem of how life began. Elements of culture, like species,
evolve over time; that is, they exhibit cumulative change that is adaptive in
nature. By studying how biological evolution got started, we gain insight into
not just the specifics of biological evolution, but also general insights into
the initiation of any evolutionary process that may be applicable to culture.
We then explore the implications of this new framework for culture on the
transformative processes of individuals. Specifically, we will address what
this emerging perspective on cultural evolution implies for to go about
attaining a sustainable worldview; that is, a web of habits, understandings,
and ways of approaching situations that is conducive to the development of a
sustainable world.
