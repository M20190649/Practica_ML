General analytical solution to Linsker's application of Hebbian rules in
  neural networks
Previous work by Linsker revealed how simple cells can emerge in the absence
of structured environmental input, via a selforganisation learning process. He
empirically showed the development of spatial-opponent cells driven only by
input noise, emerging as a result of structure in the initial synaptic
connectivity distribution. To date, a complete set of radial eigenfunctions
have not been provided for this multi-layer network. In this paper, the
complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a three-layered network is
for the first time analytically derived. Initially a simplified learning
equation is considered for which the homeostatic parameters are set to zero. To
extend the eigenfunction analysis to the full learning equation, including
non-zero homeostatic parameters, a perturbation analysis is used.
