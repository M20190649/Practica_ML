Network induces burst synchronisation in cat brain
The brain of mammals are divided into different cortical areas that are
anatomically connected forming larger networks which perform cognitive tasks.
The cat cerebral cortex is composed of 65 areas organised into the visual,
auditory, somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic cognitive regions. We have built
a network of networks, in which networks are connected among themselves
according to the connections observed in the cat cortical areas aiming to study
how inputs drive the synchronous behaviour in this cat brain-like network. We
show that without external perturbations it is possible to observe high level
of bursting synchronisation between neurons within almost all areas, except for
the auditory area. Bursting synchronisation appears between neurons in the
auditory region when an external perturbation is applied in another cognitive
area. This is a clear evidence that pattern formation and collective behaviour
in the brain might be a process mediated by other brain areas under
stimulation.
