A scalp-EEG network-based analysis of Alzheimer's disease patients at
  rest
Most brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to
alterations in the normal brain network organization and function. Exploring
these network alterations using non-invasive and easy to use technique is a
topic of great interest. In this paper, we collected EEG resting-state data
from AD patients and healthy control subjects. Functional connectivity between
scalp EEG signals was quantified using the phase locking value (PLV) for 6
frequency bands. To assess the differences in network properties,
graph-theoretical analysis was performed. AD patients showed decrease of mean
connectivity, average clustering and global efficiency in the lower alpha band.
Positive correlation between the cognitive score and the extracted graph
measures was obtained, suggesting that EEG could be a promising technique to
derive new biomarkers of AD diagnosis.
