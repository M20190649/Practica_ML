Characterization of cortical motor function and imagery-related cortical
  activity: Potential application for prehabilitation
To minimize functional morbidity associated with brain surgery, new
preventive approaches (also referred to as "prehabilitation") by using
motor-imagery-based computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) can be utilized. To achieve
successful MI-BCI performance for prehabilitation purposes, the characteristics
of an electrocorticographic (ECoG) signal that is associated with overt motor
function ("real movement" - RM) versus covert motor function ("motor imagery" -
MI) need to be determined. In our current study, 5 patients with
pharmacoresistant epilepsy (2 males, average age 25 years, SD 15), undergoing
evaluation for epilepsy surgery participated in both RM and MI tasks. Although
the RM- and MI- related ECoG changes had some common features, they also
differed in a number of ways, such as location, frequency ranges, signal
synchronization and desynchronization. These similarities and differences are
discussed in a view of other neuroimaging studies, including
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
We emphasize the need for inclusion of a broad spectrum of frequencies in ECoG
analysis, when RM- and MI- related activities are concerned.
