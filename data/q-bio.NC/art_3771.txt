A quantitative model for presynaptic free calcium dynamics during
  different stimulation protocols
The presynaptic free calcium dynamics of neurons due to various stimulation
protocols is investigated in a mathematical model. The model includes calcium
influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels, calcium buffering by
endogenous and exogenous buffers as well as calcium efflux through ATP-driven
plasma membrane calcium pumps and sodium/calcium exchangers. We want to support
a specific way of modeling which starts on the level of single proteins. Each
protein is represented by characteristics that are determined by single protein
experiments and that are considered to be widely independent of neuron types.
This allows the applications of the model to different classes of neurons and
experiments. The procedure is demonstrated for single boutons of pyramidal
neurons of the rat neocortex. The corresponding fluorescence measurements of
Koester & Sakmann (2000, J. Physiol., 529, 625) are quantitatively reproduced.
The model enables us to reconstruct the free calcium dynamics in neurons as it
would have been without fluorescence indicators starting from the fluorescence
data. We discuss the different calcium responses and find that during
high-frequency stimulation an accumulation of free calcium occurs above some
threshold stimulation frequency. The threshold frequency depends on the amount
of fluorescence indicator used in the experiment.
