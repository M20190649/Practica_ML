A complex network framework to model cognition: unveiling correlation
  structures from connectivity
Several approaches to cognition and intelligence research rely on
statistics-based models testing, namely factor analysis. In the present work we
exploit the emerging dynamical systems perspective putting the focus on the
role of the network topology underlying the relationships between cognitive
processes. We go through a couple of models of distinct cognitive phenomena and
yet find the conditions for them to be mathematically equivalent. We find a
non-trivial attractor of the system that corresponds to the exact definition of
a well-known network centrality and hence stress the interplay between the
dynamics and the underlying network connectivity, showing that both of the two
are relevant. The connectivity structure between cognitive processes is not
known but yet it is not any. Regardless of the network considered, it is always
possible to recover a positive manifold of correlations. However, we show that
different network topologies lead to different plausible statistical models
concerning correlations structure, ranging from one to multiple factors models
and richer correlation structures.
