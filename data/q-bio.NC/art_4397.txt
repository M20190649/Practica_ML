Multi-chimera states in the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model
We study the dynamics of identical leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with
symmetric non-local coupling. Upon varying control parameters (coupling
strength, coupling range, refractory period) we investigate the system's
behaviour and highlight the formation of chimera states. We show that the
introduction of a refractory period enlarges the parameter region where chimera
states appear and affects the chimera multiplicity.
