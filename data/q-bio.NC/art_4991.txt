A Novel Variational Family for Hidden Nonlinear Markov Models
Latent variable models have been widely applied for the analysis and
visualization of large datasets. In the case of sequential data, closed-form
inference is possible when the transition and observation functions are linear.
However, approximate inference techniques are usually necessary when dealing
with nonlinear dynamics and observation functions. Here, we propose a novel
variational inference framework for the explicit modeling of time series,
Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover
nonlinear observation and transition functions from sequential data. The
framework includes a structured approximate posterior, and an algorithm that
relies on the fixed-point iteration method to find the best estimate for latent
trajectories. We apply the method to several datasets and show that it is able
to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of these systems, in some cases
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
