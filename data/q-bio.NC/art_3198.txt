How images determine our visual search strategy
When searching for a target within an image our brain can adopt different
strategies, but which one does it choose? This question can be answered by
tracking the motion of the eye while it executes the task. Following many
individuals performing various search tasks we distinguish between two
competing strategies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a model that
captures the interplay of the search strategies and allows us to create
artificial eye-tracking trajectories, which could be compared to the
experimental ones. Identifying the model parameters allows us to quantify the
strategy employed in terms of ensemble averages, characterizing each
experimental cohort. In this way we can discern with high sensitivity the
relation between the visual landscape and the average strategy, disclosing how
small variations in the image induce changes in the strategy.
