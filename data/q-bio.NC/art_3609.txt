Scalable Spike Source Localization in Extracellular Recordings using
  Amortized Variational Inference
Extracellular recordings using modern, dense probes provide detailed
footprints of action potentials (spikes) from thousands of neurons
simultaneously. Inferring the activity of single neurons from these recordings,
however, is a complex blind source separation problem, complicated both by the
high intrinsic data dimensionality and large data volume. Despite these
complications, dense probes can allow for the estimation of a spike's source
location, a powerful feature for determining the firing neuron's position and
identity in the recording. Here we present a novel, generative model for
inferring the source of individual spikes given observed electrical traces. To
allow for scalable, efficient inference, we implement our model as a
variational autoencoder and perform amortized variational inference. We
evaluate our method on biophysically realistic simulated datasets, showing that
our method outperforms heuristic localization methods such as center of mass
and can improve spike sorting performance significantly. We further apply our
model to real data to show that it is an effective, interpretable tool for
analyzing large-scale extracellular recordings.
