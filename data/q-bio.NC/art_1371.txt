Closed-loop control of a modular neuromorphic biohybrid
Neural networks modularity is a major challenge for the development of
control circuits of neural activity. Under physiological limitations, the
accessible regions for external stimulation are possibly different from the
functionally relevant ones, requiring complex indirect control designs.
Moreover, control over one region might affect activity of other downstream
networks, once sparse connections exist. We address these questions by
developing a hybrid device of a cortical culture functionally integrated with a
biomimetic hardware neural network. This design enables the study of modular
networks controllability, while connectivity is well-defined and key features
of cortical networks are accessible. Using a closed-loop control to monitor the
activity of the coupled hybrid, we show that both modules are congruently
modified, in the macroscopic as well as the microscopic activity levels.
Control impacts efficiently the activity on both sides whether the control
circuit is an indirect series one, or implemented independently only on one of
the modules. Hence, these results present global functional impacts of a local
control intervention. Overall, this strategy provides an experimental access to
the controllability of neural activity irregularities, when embedded in a
modular organization.
