Existence of Millisecond-order Stable States in Time-Varying Phase
  Synchronization Measure in EEG Signals
In this paper, we have developed a new measure of understanding the temporal
evolution of phase synchronization for EEG signals using cross-electrode
information. From this measure it is found that there exists a small number of
well-defined phase-synchronized states, each of which is stable for few
milliseconds during the execution of a face perception task. We termed these
quasi-stable states as synchrostates. We used k-means clustering algorithms to
estimate the optimal number of synchrostates from 100 trials of EEG signals
over 128 channels. Our results show that these synchrostates exist consistently
in all the different trials. It is also found that from the onset of the
stimulus, switching between these synchrostates results in well-behaved
temporal sequence with repeatability which may be indicative of the dynamics of
the cognitive process underlying that task. Therefore these synchrostates and
their temporal switching sequences may be used as a new measure of the
stability of phase synchrony and information exchange between different regions
of a human brain.
