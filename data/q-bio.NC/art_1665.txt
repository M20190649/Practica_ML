Quantifying the role of neurons for behavior is a mediation question
Many systems neuroscientists want to understand neurons in terms of
mediation; we want to understand how neurons are involved in the causal chain
from stimulus to behavior. Unfortunately, most tools are inappropriate for that
while our language takes mediation for granted. Here we discuss the contrast
between our conceptual drive towards mediation and the difficulty of obtaining
meaningful evidence.
