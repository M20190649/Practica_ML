Self-wiring in neural nets of point-like cortical neurons fails to
  reproduce cytoarchitectural differences
We propose a model for description of activity-dependent evolution and
self-wiring between binary neurons. Specifically, this model can be used for
investigation of growth of neuronal connectivity in the developing neocortex.
By using computational simulations with appropriate training pattern sequences,
we show that long-term memory can be encoded in neuronal connectivity and that
the external stimulations form part of the functioning neocortical circuit. It
is proposed that such binary neuron representations of point-like cortical
neurons fail to reproduce cytoarchitectural differences of the neocortical
organization, which has implications for inadequacies of compartmental models.
