Comparing different muscle activation dynamics using sensitivity
  analysis
In this paper, we mathematically compared two models of mammalian striated
muscle activation dynamics proposed by Hatze and Zajac. Both models are
representative of a broad variety of biomechanical models formulated as
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The models incorporate some parameters
that directly represent known physiological properties. Other parameters have
been introduced to reproduce empirical observations. We used sensitivity
analysis as a mathematical tool for investigating the influence of model
parameters on the solution of the ODEs. That is, we adopted a former approach
for calculating such (first order) sensitivities. Additionally, we expanded it
to treating initial conditions as parameters and to calculating second order
sensitivities. The latter quantify the non-linearly coupled effect of any
combination of two parameters. As a completion we used a global sensitivity
analysis approach to take the variability of parameters into account. The
method we suggest has numerous uses. A theoretician striving for model
reduction may use it for identifying particularly low sensitivities to detect
superfluous parameters. An experimenter may use it for identifying particularly
high sensitivities to facilitate determining the parameter value with maximised
precision.
