Generalized Phase Representation of Integrate-and-Fire Models
The quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model captures the normal form
bifurcation dynamics of Type-I neurons found in cortex. Remarkably, this model
is known to have a dual equivalent representation in terms of phase, called the
$\theta$-model, which has advantages for numerical simulations and analysis
over the QIF model. Here, I investigate the nature of the dual representation
and derive the general phase model expression for all integrate-and-fire
models. Moreover, I show the condition for which the phase models exhibit
discontinuous onset firing rate, the hallmark of Type-II spiking neurons.
