Brain Modularity Mediates the Relation between Task Complexity and
  Performance
Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has focused on analyzing the brain as a
network, rather than as a collection of independent regions. Prior studies
taking this approach have found that individual differences in the degree of
modularity of the brain network relate to performance on cognitive tasks.
However, inconsistent results concerning the direction of this relationship
have been obtained, with some tasks showing better performance as modularity
increases and other tasks showing worse performance. A recent theoretical model
(Chen & Deem, 2015) suggests that these inconsistencies may be explained on the
grounds that high-modularity networks favor performance on simple tasks whereas
low-modularity networks favor performance on more complex tasks. The current
study tests these predictions by relating modularity from resting-state fMRI to
performance on a set of simple and complex behavioral tasks. Complex and simple
tasks were defined on the basis of whether they did or did not draw on
executive attention. Consistent with predictions, we found a negative
correlation between individuals' modularity and their performance on a
composite measure combining scores from the complex tasks but a positive
correlation with performance on a composite measure combining scores from the
simple tasks. These results and theory presented here provide a framework for
linking measures of whole brain organization from network neuroscience to
cognitive processing.
