Electrolyte-gated organic synapse transistor interfaced with neurons
We demonstrate an electrolyte-gated hybrid nanoparticle/organic synapstor
(synapse-transistor, termed EGOS) that exhibits short-term plasticity as
biological synapses. The response of EGOS makes it suitable to be interfaced
with neurons: short-term plasticity is observed at spike voltage as low as 50
mV (in a par with the amplitude of action potential in neurons) and with a
typical response time in the range of tens milliseconds. Human neuroblastoma
stem cells are adhered and differentiated into neurons on top of EGOS. We
observe that the presence of the cells does not alter short-term plasticity of
the device.
