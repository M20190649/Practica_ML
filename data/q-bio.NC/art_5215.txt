Mean-field dynamics of sequence processing neural networks with finite
  connectivity
A recent dynamic mean-field theory for sequence processing in fully connected
neural networks of Hopfield-type (During, Coolen and Sherrington, 1998) is
extended and analized here for a symmetrically diluted network with finite
connectivity near saturation. Equations for the dynamics and the stationary
states are obtained for the macroscopic observables and the precise equivalence
is established with the single-pattern retrieval problem in a layered
feed-forward network with finite connectivity.
