Self-sustained activity in a small-world network of excitable neurons
We study the dynamics of excitable integrate-and-fire neurons in a
small-world network. At low densities $p$ of directed random connections, a
localized transient stimulus results in either self-sustained persistent
activity or in a brief transient followed by failure. Averages over the
quenched ensemble reveal that the probability of failure changes from 0 to 1
over a narrow range in $p$; this failure transition can be described
analytically through an extension of an existing mean-field result. Exceedingly
long transients emerge at higher densities $p$; their activity patterns are
disordered, in contrast to the mostly periodic persistent patterns observed at
low $p$. The times at which such patterns die out are consistent with a
stretched-exponential distribution, which depends sensitively on the
propagation velocity of the excitation.
