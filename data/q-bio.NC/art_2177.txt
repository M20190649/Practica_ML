Qubit-wannabe Neural Networks
Recurrent neurons, or "simulated" qubits, can store simultaneous true and
false with probabilistic behaviors usually reserved for the qubits of quantum
physics. Although possible to construct artificially, simulated qubits are
intended to explain biological mysteries. It is shown below that they can
simulate certain quantum computations and, although less potent than the qubits
of quantum physics, they nevertheless are shown to significantly exceed the
capabilities of classical deterministic circuits.
