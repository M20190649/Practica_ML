Intelligent systems in the context of surrounding environment
We investigate the behavioral patterns of a population of agents, each
controlled by a simple biologically motivated neural network model, when they
are set in competition against each other in the Minority Model of Challet and
Zhang. We explore the effects of changing agent characteristics, demonstrating
that crowding behavior takes place among agents of similar memory, and show how
this allows unique `rogue' agents with higher memory values to take advantage
of a majority population. We also show that agents' analytic capability is
largely determined by the size of the intermediary layer of neurons.
  In the context of these results, we discuss the general nature of natural and
artificial intelligence systems, and suggest intelligence only exists in the
context of the surrounding environment (embodiment).
