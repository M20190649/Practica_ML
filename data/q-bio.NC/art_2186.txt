An excitable electronic circuit as a sensory neuron model
An electronic circuit device, inspired on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of
neuronal excitability, was constructed and shown to operate with
characteristics compatible with those of biological sensory neurons. The
nonlinear dynamical model of the electronics quantitatively reproduces the
experimental observations on the circuit, including the Hopf bifurcation at the
onset of tonic spiking. Moreover, we have implemented an analog noise generator
as a source to study the variability of the spike trains. When the circuit is
in the excitable regime, coherence resonance is observed. At sufficiently low
noise intensity the spike trains have Poisson statistics, as in many biological
neurons. The transfer function of the stochastic spike trains has a dynamic
range of 6 dB, close to experimental values for real olfactory receptor
neurons.
