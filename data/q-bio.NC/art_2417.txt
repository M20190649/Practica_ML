Initiation and blocking of the action potential in the axon in weak
  ultrasonic or microwave fields
In this paper, we analyze the effect of the redistribution of the
transmembrane ion channels in the axon caused by longitudinal acoustic
vibrations of the membrane. These oscillations can be excited by an external
source of ultrasound and weak microwave radiation interacting with the charges
sitting on the surface of the lipid membrane. It is shown, using the
Hodgkin-Huxley model of the axon, that the density redistribution of
transmembrane sodium channels may reduce the threshold of the action potential,
up to its spontaneous initiation. At the significant redistribution of sodium
channels in membrane, the rarefaction zones of the transmembrane channels
density are formed, blocking the propagation of the action potential. Blocking
the action potential propagation along the axon is shown to cause anestesia in
the example case of a squid axon. Various approaches to experimental
observation of the effects considered in this paper are discussed.
