Perspective: network-guided pattern formation of neural dynamics
The understanding of neural activity patterns is fundamentally linked to an
understanding of how the brain's network architecture shapes dynamical
processes. Established approaches rely mostly on deviations of a given network
from certain classes of random graphs. Hypotheses about the supposed role of
prominent topological features (for instance, the roles of modularity, network
motifs, or hierarchical network organization) are derived from these
deviations. An alternative strategy could be to study deviations of network
architectures from regular graphs (rings, lattices) and consider the
implications of such deviations for self-organized dynamic patterns on the
network. Following this strategy, we draw on the theory of spatiotemporal
pattern formation and propose a novel perspective for analyzing dynamics on
networks, by evaluating how the self-organized dynamics are confined by network
architecture to a small set of permissible collective states. In particular, we
discuss the role of prominent topological features of brain connectivity, such
as hubs, modules and hierarchy, in shaping activity patterns. We illustrate the
notion of network-guided pattern formation with numerical simulations and
outline how it can facilitate the understanding of neural dynamics.
