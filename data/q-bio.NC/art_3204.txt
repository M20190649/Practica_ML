Statistical Physics and Representations in Real and Artificial Neural
  Networks
This document presents the material of two lectures on statistical physics
and neural representations, delivered by one of us (R.M.) at the Fundamental
Problems in Statistical Physics XIV summer school in July 2017. In a first
part, we consider the neural representations of space (maps) in the
hippocampus. We introduce an extension of the Hopfield model, able to store
multiple spatial maps as continuous, finite-dimensional attractors. The phase
diagram and dynamical properties of the model are analyzed. We then show how
spatial representations can be dynamically decoded using an effective Ising
model capturing the correlation structure in the neural data, and compare
applications to data obtained from hippocampal multi-electrode recordings and
by (sub)sampling our attractor model. In a second part, we focus on the problem
of learning data representations in machine learning, in particular with
artificial neural networks. We start by introducing data representations
through some illustrations. We then analyze two important algorithms, Principal
Component Analysis and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, with tools from
statistical physics.
