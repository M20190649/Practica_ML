Exact firing time statistics of neurons driven by discrete inhibitory
  noise
Neurons in the intact brain receive a continuous and irregular synaptic
bombardment from excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic neurons, which
determines the firing activity of the stimulated neuron. In order to
investigate the influence of inhibitory stimulation on the firing time
statistics, we consider Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons subject to inhibitory
instantaneous post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we report exact results
for the firing rate, the coefficient of variation and the spike train spectrum
for various synaptic weight distributions. Our results are not limited to
stimulations of infinitesimal amplitude, but they apply as well to finite
amplitude post-synaptic potentials, thus being able to capture the effect of
rare and large spikes. The developed methods are able to reproduce also the
average firing properties of heterogeneous neuronal populations.
