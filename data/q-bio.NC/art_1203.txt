Consistency of Regions of Interest as nodes of functional brain networks
  measured by fMRI
The functional network approach, where fMRI BOLD time series are mapped to
networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.
