Field theory for biophysical neural networks
The human brain is a complex system composed of a network of hundreds of
billions of discrete neurons that are coupled through time dependent synapses.
Simulating the entire brain is a daunting challenge. Here, we show how ideas
from quantum field theory can be used to construct an effective reduced theory,
which may be analyzed with lattice computations. We give some examples of how
the formalism can be applied to biophysically plausible neural network models.
