Stochastic synchronization of neural activity waves
We demonstrate that waves in distinct layers of a neuronal network can become
phase-locked by common spatiotemporal noise. This phenomenon is studied for
stationary bumps, traveling waves, and breathers. A weak noise expansion is
used to derive an effective equation for the position of the wave in each
layer, yielding a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise.
Stability of the synchronous state is characterized by a Lyapunov exponent,
which we can compute analytically from the reduced system. Our results extend
previous work on limit-cycle oscillators, showing common noise can synchronize
waves in a broad class of models.
