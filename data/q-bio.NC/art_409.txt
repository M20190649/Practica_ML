On the Technology Prospects and Investment Opportunities for Scalable
  Neuroscience
Two major initiatives to accelerate research in the brain sciences have
focused attention on developing a new generation of scientific instruments for
neuroscience. These instruments will be used to record static (structural) and
dynamic (behavioral) information at unprecedented spatial and temporal
resolution and report out that information in a form suitable for computational
analysis. We distinguish between recording - taking measurements of individual
cells and the extracellular matrix - and reporting - transcoding, packaging and
transmitting the resulting information for subsequent analysis - as these
represent very different challenges as we scale the relevant technologies to
support simultaneously tracking the many neurons that comprise neural circuits
of interest. We investigate a diverse set of technologies with the purpose of
anticipating their development over the span of the next 10 years and
categorizing their impact in terms of short-term [1-2 years], medium-term [2-5
years] and longer-term [5-10 years] deliverables.
