"Social Laser": Action Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Social
  Energy
The problem of the "explanation" of recent social explosions, especially in
the Middle East, but also in Southern Europe and the USA, have been debated
actively in the social and political literature. We can mention the
contributions of P. Mason, F. Fukuyama, E. Schmidt and J. Cohen, I. Krastev to
this debate. We point out that the diversity of opinions and conclusions is
really amazing. At the moment, there is no consistent and commonly acceptable
theory of these phenomena. We present a model of social explosions based on a
novel approach for the description of social processes, namely, the
quantum-like approach. Here quantum theory is treated simply as an operational
formalism - without any direct relation to physics. We explore the quantum-like
laser model to describe the possibility of Action Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Social Energy (ASE).
