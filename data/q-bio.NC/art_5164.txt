What does it mean to understand a neural network?
We can define a neural network that can learn to recognize objects in less
than 100 lines of code. However, after training, it is characterized by
millions of weights that contain the knowledge about many object types across
visual scenes. Such networks are thus dramatically easier to understand in
terms of the code that makes them than the resulting properties, such as tuning
or connections. In analogy, we conjecture that rules for development and
learning in brains may be far easier to understand than their resulting
properties. The analogy suggests that neuroscience would benefit from a focus
on learning and development.
