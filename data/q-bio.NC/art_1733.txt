Dynamics of random recurrent networks with correlated low-rank structure
A given neural network in the brain is involved in many different tasks. This
implies that, when considering a specific task, the network's connectivity
contains a component which is related to the task and another component which
can be considered random. Understanding the interplay between the structured
and random components, and their effect on network dynamics and functionality
is an important open question. Recent studies addressed the co-existence of
random and structured connectivity, but considered the two parts to be
uncorrelated. This constraint limits the dynamics and leaves the random
connectivity non-functional. Algorithms that train networks to perform specific
tasks typically generate correlations between structure and random
connectivity. Here we study nonlinear networks with correlated structured and
random components, assuming the structure to have a low rank. We develop an
analytic framework to establish the precise effect of the correlations on the
eigenvalue spectrum of the joint connectivity. We find that the spectrum
consists of a bulk and multiple outliers, whose location is predicted by our
theory. Using mean-field theory, we show that these outliers directly determine
both the fixed points of the system and their stability. Taken together, our
analysis elucidates how correlations allow structured and random connectivity
to synergistically extend the range of computations available to networks.
