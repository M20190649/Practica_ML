Apparent extracellular current density and extracellular space: basis
  for the current source density analysis in neural tissue
This article provides a theoretical basis for relating macroscopic electrical
signals recorded from biological tissue, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and
local field potential (LFP), to the electrophysiological processes at the
cellular level in a manner consistent with Maxwell's equations. Concepts of the
apparent extracellular current density and the apparent extracellular space
with apparent permittivity and conductivity are introduced from the
conservation of current and Gauss's theorem. A general equation for the current
source density (CSD) analysis is derived for biological tissue with
frequency-dependent apparent permittivity and conductivity. An intuitive
account of the apparent extracellular space is given to relate the concept to
the dielectric dispersion of biological tissue.
