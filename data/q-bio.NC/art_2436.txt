Crosstalk and transitions between multiple spatial maps in an attractor
  neural network model of the hippocampus: Collective motion of the activity
  (II)
The dynamics of a neural model for hippocampal place cells storing spatial
maps is studied. In the absence of external input, depending on the number of
cells and on the values of control parameters (number of environments stored,
level of neural noise, average level of activity, connectivity of place cells),
a 'clump' of spatially-localized activity can diffuse, or remains pinned due to
crosstalk between the environments. In the single-environment case, the
macroscopic coefficient of diffusion of the clump and its effective mobility
are calculated analytically from first principles, and corroborated by
numerical simulations. In the multi-environment case the heights and the widths
of the pinning barriers are analytically characterized with the replica method;
diffusion within one map is then in competition with transitions between
different maps. Possible mechanisms enhancing mobility are proposed and tested.
