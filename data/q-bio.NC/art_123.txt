A Framework for Conscious Information Processing
This paper exploits the fact that the variability in the inter-spike
intervals, in the spike train issuing from a neuron, carries substantial
information regarding the input to the neuron. A framework for neuronal
information processing is proposed which utilizes the above fact to distinguish
phenomenal from non-phenomenal mental representation. In the process, an
explanation is offered as to what it is, in the nature of conscious mental
states, that imparts them a subjective feeling: there is something it is like
to be in those mental states. To give empirical support, it is shown how the
proposed framework can neatly explain, the delay in eliciting conscious
awareness as observed by Libet and the related backwards referral in time.
