Synthetic ablations in the C. elegans nervous system
Synthetic lethality, the finding that the simultaneous knockout of two or
more individually non-essential genes leads to cell or organism death, has
offered a systematic framework to explore cellular function, and also offered
therapeutic applications. Yet, the concept lacks its parallel in neuroscience -
a systematic knowledge base on the role of double or higher order ablations in
the functioning of a neural system. Here, we use the framework of network
control to systematically predict the ablation of neuron pairs and triplets. We
find that surprisingly small sets of 58 pairs and 46 triplets can reduce muscle
controllability, and that these sets are localised in the nervous system in
distinct groups. Further, they lead to highly specific experimentally testable
predictions about mechanisms of loss of control, and which muscle cells are
expected to experience this loss.
