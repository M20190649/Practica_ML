Delay stabilizes stochastic motion of bumps in layered neural fields
We study the effects of propagation delays on the stochastic dynamics of
bumps in neural fields with multiple layers. In the absence of noise, each
layer supports a stationary bump. Using linear stability analysis, we show that
delayed coupling between layers causes translating perturbations of the bumps
to decay in the noise-free system. Adding noise to the system causes bumps to
wander as a random walk. However, coupling between layers can reduce the
variability of this stochastic motion by canceling noise that perturbs bumps in
opposite directions. Delays in interlaminar coupling can further reduce
variability, since they couple bump positions to states from the past. We
demonstrate these relationships by deriving an asymptotic approximation for the
effective motion of bumps. This yields a stochastic delay-differential equation
where each delayed term arises from an interlaminar coupling. The impact of
delays is well approximated by using a small delay expansion, which allows us
to compute the effective diffusion in bumps' positions, accurately matching
results from numerical simulations.
