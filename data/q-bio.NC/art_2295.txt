Evidence for early identification of Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease is a human brain disease that affects a significant
fraction of the population by causing problems with short-term memory,
thinking, spatial orientation and behavior, memory loss and other intellectual
abilities. Up to date there is no singular test that can definitively diagnose
Alzheimer's disease, although imaging technology designed to detect Alzheimer's
plaques and tangles is rapidly becoming more powerful and precise. In this
paper we introduce a decision-making model, based on the combination of
mitochondrial hypothesis-dynamics with the role of electromagnetic influences
of the metal ions into the inner mitochondrial membrane and the quantitative
analysis of mitochondrial population. While there are few disappointing
clinical-trial results for drug treatments in patients with Alzheimer's
disease, scientific community need alternative diagnostic tools rather
investing mainly in amyloid-targeting drugs.
