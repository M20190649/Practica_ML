Like Quantum Computing without Quantum Physics: Is it How the Brain
  Works?
Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common
and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The
computation in both is parallel and non-discrete at least in time. Though the
underlying physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic,
the observed or interpreted outcomes look probabilistic. Consequently, various
investigations have thus been undertaken to understand and mimic the brain on
the basis of quantum computing and physics. However, there have been arguments
from physics and cognitive science points of view on whether the brain can and
have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that need to survive in the
macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This paper presents a unique
physical and microscopic computational model of the brain based on an ansatz
that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, not with
quantum waves but with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in
the context of wave-based computing plays a critical role in bridging the gap
between Cartesian and Tensor product states of classical and quantum waves. Our
model can provide a basis for a unified computing framework of artificial
intelligence and quantum computing.
