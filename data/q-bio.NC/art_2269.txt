A Quantum-mechanical description of ion motion within the confining
  potentials of voltage gated ion channels
Voltage gated channel proteins cooperate in the transmission of membrane
potentials between nerve cells. With the recent progress in atomic-scaled
biological chemistry it has now become established that these channel proteins
provide highly correlated atomic environments that may maintain electronic
coherences even at warm temperatures. Here we demonstrate solutions of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation that represent the interaction of a single potassium
ion within the surrounding carbonyl dipoles in the Berneche-Roux model of the
bacterial \textit{KcsA} model channel. We show that, depending on the
surrounding carbonyl derived potentials, alkali ions can become highly
delocalized in the filter region of proteins at warm temperatures. We provide
estimations about the temporal evolution of the kinetic energy of ions
depending on their interaction with other ions, their location within the
oxygen cage of the proteins filter region and depending on different
oscillation frequencies of the surrounding carbonyl groups. Our results provide
the first evidence that quantum mechanical properties are needed to explain a
fundamental biological property such as ion-selectivity in trans-membrane
ion-currents and the effect on gating kinetics and shaping of classical
conductances in electrically excitable cells.
