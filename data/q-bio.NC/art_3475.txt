Reframing Convergent and Divergent Thought for the 21st Century
Convergent thought is defined and measured in terms of the ability to perform
on tasks where there is a single correct solution, and divergent thought is
defined and measured in terms of the ability to generate multiple different
solutions. However, this characterization of them presents inconsistencies, and
despite that they are promoted as key constructs of creativity, they do not
capture the capacity to reiteratively modify an idea in light of new
perspectives arising out of an overarching conceptual framework. Research on
formal models of concepts and their interactions suggests that different
creative outputs may be projections of the same underlying idea at different
phases of this kind of 'honing' process. This leads us to redefine convergent
thought as thought in which the relevant concepts are considered from
conventional contexts, and divergent thought as thought in which they are
considered from unconventional contexts. Implications for the assessment of
creativity are discussed.
