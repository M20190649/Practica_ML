An increase in membrane cholesterol by graphene oxide disrupts calcium
  homeostasis in primary astrocytes
The use of graphene nanomaterials (GNMs) for biomedical applications targeted
to the central nervous system is exponentially increasing, although precise
information on their effects on brain cells is lacking. In this work, we
addressed the molecular changes induced in cortical astrocytes by few-layer
graphene (FLG) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. Our results show that exposure
to FLG/GO does not affect cell viability or proliferation. However, proteomic
and lipidomic analyses unveiled alterations in several cellular processes,
including intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis and cholesterol metabolism,
which were particularly intense in cells exposed to GO. Indeed, GO exposure
impaired spontaneous and evoked astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals and induced a marked
increase in membrane cholesterol levels. Importantly, cholesterol depletion
fully rescued [Ca2+]i dynamics in GO-treated cells, indicating a causal
relationship between these GO-mediated effects. Our results indicate that
exposure to GNMs alters intracellular signaling in astrocytes and may impact on
astrocyte-neuron interactions.
