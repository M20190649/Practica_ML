Bypassing damaged nervous tissue
We show the principal ability of bypassing damaged demyelinated portions of
nervous tissue, thereby restoring its normal function for the passage of action
potentials. We carry out a theoretical analysis on the basis of the
synchronization mechanism of action potential propagation along a bundle of
neurons, proposed recently in [1]. And we discuss the feasibility of implement
a bypass to restore damaged nervous tissue and creating an artificial neuron
network.
