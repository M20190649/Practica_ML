Utilizing Neurons for Digital Logic Circuits: A Molecular Communications
  Analysis
With the advancement of synthetic biology, several new tools have been
conceptualized over the years as alternative treatments for current medical
procedures. Most of those applications are applied to various chronic diseases.
This work investigates how synthetically engineered neurons can operate as
digital logic gates that can be used towards bio-computing for the brain. We
quantify the accuracy of logic gates under high firing rates amid a network of
neurons and by how much it can smooth out uncontrolled neuronal firings. To
test the efficacy of our method, simulations composed of computational models
of neurons connected in a structure that represents a logic gate are performed.
The simulations demonstrated the accuracy of performing the correct logic
operation, and how specific properties such as the firing rate can play an
important role in the accuracy. As part of the analysis, the Mean squared error
is used to quantify the quality of our proposed model and predicting the
accurate operation of a gate based on different sampling frequencies. As an
application, the logic gates were used to trap epileptic seizures in a neuronal
network, where the results demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing the
firing rate. Our proposed system has the potential for computing numerous
neurological conditions of the brain.
