Nicotinic Î±7 acetylcholine receptor-mediated currents are not
  modulated by the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid in adult hippocampal
  interneurons
The tryptophan metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), is classically known to be
an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Within the last decade several
reports have been published suggesting that KYNA also blocks nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the \alpha7 subunit (\alpha7*).
Most of these reports involve either indirect measurements of KYNA effects on
\alpha7 nAChR function, or are reports of KYNA effects in complicated in vivo
systems. However, a recent report investigating KYNA interactions with \alpha7
nAChRs failed to detect an interaction using direct measurements of \alpha7
nAChRs function. Further, it showed that a KYNA blockade of \alpha7 nAChR
stimulated GABA release (an indirect measure of \alpha7 nAChR function) was not
due to KYNA blockade of the \alpha7 nAChRs. The current study measured the
direct effects of KYNA on \alpha7-containing nAChRs expressed on interneurons
in the hilar and CA1 stratum radiatum regions of the mouse hippocampus and on
interneurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Here we show that KYNA
does not block \alpha7* nACHRs using direct patch-clamprecording of \alpha7
currents in adult brain slices.
