Neural Activity of Heterogeneous Inhibitory Spiking Networks with Delay
We study a network of spiking neurons with heterogeneous excitabilities
connected via inhibitory delayed pulses. For globally coupled systems the
increase of the inhibitory coupling reduces the number of firing neurons by
following a Winner Takes All mechanism. For sufficiently large transmission
delay we observe the emergence of collective oscillations in the system beyond
a critical coupling value. Heterogeneity promotes neural inactivation and
asynchronous dynamics and its effect can be counteracted by considering longer
time delays. In sparse networks, inhibition has the counterintuitive effect of
promoting neural reactivation of silent neurons for sufficiently large
coupling. In this regime, current fluctuations are on one side responsible for
neural firing of sub-threshold neurons and on the other side for their
desynchronization. Therefore, collective oscillations are present only in a
limited range of coupling values, which remains finite in the thermodynamic
limit. Out of this range the dynamics is asynchronous and for very large
inhibition neurons display a bursting behaviour alternating periods of silence
with periods where they fire freely in absence of any inhibition.
