Higher physical fitness levels are associated with less language decline
  in healthy ageing
Healthy ageing is associated with decline in cognitive abilities such as
language. Aerobic fitness has been shown to ameliorate decline in some
cognitive domains, but the potential benefits for language have not been
examined. In a cross-sectional sample, we investigated the relationship between
aerobic fitness and tip-of-the-tongue states. These are among the most frequent
cognitive failures in healthy older adults and occur when a speaker knows a
word but is unable to produce it. We found that healthy older adults indeed
experience more tip-of-the-tongue states than young adults. Importantly, higher
aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of experiencing
tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults. Fitness-related differences
in word finding abilities are observed over and above effects of age. This is
the first demonstration of a link between aerobic fitness and language
functioning in healthy older adults.
