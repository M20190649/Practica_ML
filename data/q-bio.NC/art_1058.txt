Graph analysis of spontaneous brain network using EEG source
  connectivity
Exploring the human brain networks during rest is a topic of great interest.
Several structural and functional studies have previously been conducted to
study the intrinsic brain networks. In this paper, we focus on investigating
the human brain network topology using dense Electroencephalography (EEG)
source connectivity approach. We applied graph theoretical methods on
functional networks reconstructed from resting state data acquired using EEG in
14 healthy subjects. Our findings confirmed the existence of sets of brain
regions considered as functional hubs. In particular, the isthmus cingulate and
the orbitofrontal regions reveal high levels of integration. Results also
emphasize on the critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in enabling an
efficient communication between brain regions.
