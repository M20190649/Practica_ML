An organizing center in a planar model of neuronal excitability
The paper studies the excitability properties of a generalized
FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The model differs from the purely competitive
FitzHugh-Nagumo model in that it accounts for the effect of cooperative gating
variables such as activation of calcium currents. Excitability is explored by
unfolding a pitchfork bifurcation that is shown to organize five different
types of excitability. In addition to the three classical types of neuronal
excitability, two novel types are described and distinctly associated to the
presence of cooperative variables.
