In reply to Faes et al. and Barnett et al. regarding "A study of
  problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience
  perspective"
This reply is in response to commentaries by Barnett, Barrett, and Seth
(arXiv:1708.08001) and Faes, Stramaglia, and Marinazzo (arXiv:1708.06990) on
our paper entitled "A study of problems encountered in Granger causality
analysis from a neuroscience perspective." (PNAS 114(34):7063-7072. 2017). In
our paper, we analyzed several properties of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) and
discussed potential problems in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated: (i)
that GGC, estimated using separate model fits, is either severely biased,
particularly when the true model is known, or a high variance is introduced to
overcome the bias; and (ii) that GGC does not reflect some component dynamics
of the system. The commentaries by both Faes et al. and Barnett et al. point
out that the computational problems of (i) are resolved by using recent
computational methods. We acknowledge that these problems are indeed resolved
by these methods. However, the traditional computation using separate model
fits continues to be presented and applied. More fundamentally, the
interpretational problems stemming from (ii) are not in anyway addressed by the
improved methods because they are inherent to the definition of GGC. These
properties are indeed acknowledged by both commentaries. We have no
misconception of the GGC measure and do not claim that these properties are
facially wrong. But we do discuss at length how these properties make it
inappropriate and misleading for common types of scientific questions, how
presentation of GGC results without model estimates are not decipherable, and
how the absence of clear statements of questions of interest present further
opportunities for misinterpretation.
