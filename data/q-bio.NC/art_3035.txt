Synchronization of oscillators through time-shifted common inputs
Shared upstream dynamical processes are frequently the source of common
inputs in various physical and biological systems. However, due to finite
signal transmission speeds and differences in the distance to the source, time
shifts between otherwise common inputs are unavoidable. Since common inputs can
be a source of correlation between the elements of multi-unit dynamical
systems, regardless of whether these elements are directly connected with one
another or not, it is of importance to understand their impact on
synchronization. As a canonical model that is representative for a variety of
different dynamical systems, we study limit-cycle oscillators that are driven
by stochastic time-shifted common inputs. We show that if the oscillators are
coupled, time shifts in stochastic common inputs do not simply shift the
distribution of the phase differences, but rather the distribution actually
changes as a result. The best synchronization is therefore achieved at a
precise intermediate value of the time shift, which is due to a resonance-like
effect with the most probable phase difference that is determined by the
deterministic dynamics.
