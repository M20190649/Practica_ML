Biologically-Inspired Electronics with Memory Circuit Elements
Several abilities of biological systems, such as adaptation to natural
environment, or of animals to learn patterns when appropriately trained, are
features that are extremely useful, if emulated by electronic circuits, in
applications ranging from robotics to solution of complex optimization
problems, traffic control, etc. In this chapter, we discuss several examples of
biologically-inspired circuits that take advantage of memory circuit elements,
namely, electronic elements whose resistive, capacitive or inductive
characteristics depend on their past dynamics. We provide several illustrations
of what can be accomplished with these elements including learning circuits and
related adaptive filters, neuromorphic and cellular computing circuits, analog
massively-parallel computation architectures, etc. We also give examples of
experimental realizations of memory circuit elements and discuss opportunities
and challenges in this new field.
