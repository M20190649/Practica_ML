An associative memory of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks with
  Willshaw-type synaptic couplings
An associative memory has been discussed of neural networks consisting of
spiking N (=100) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with time-delayed couplings, which
memorize P patterns in their synaptic weights. In addition to excitatory
synapses whose strengths are modified after the Willshaw-type learning rule
with the 0/1 code for quiescent/active states, the network includes uniform
inhibitory synapses which are introduced to reduce cross-talk noises. Our
simulations of the HH neuron network for the noise-free state have shown to
yield a fairly good performance with the storage capacity of $\alpha_c = P_{\rm
max}/N \sim 0.4 - 2.4$ for the low neuron activity of $f \sim 0.04-0.10$. This
storage capacity of our temporal-code network is comparable to that of the
rate-code model with the Willshaw-type synapses. Our HH neuron network is
realized not to be vulnerable to the distribution of time delays in couplings.
The variability of interspace interval (ISI) of output spike trains in the
process of retrieving stored patterns is also discussed.
