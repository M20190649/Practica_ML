Burst detection methods
`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.
