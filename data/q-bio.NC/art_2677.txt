Dynamic similarity promotes interpersonal coordination in joint-action
Human movement has been studied for decades and dynamic laws of motion that
are common to all humans have been derived. Yet, every individual moves
differently from everyone else (faster/slower, harder/smoother etc). We propose
here an index of such variability, namely an individual motor signature (IMS)
able to capture the subtle differences in the way each of us moves. We show
that the IMS of a person is time-invariant and that it significantly differs
from those of other individuals. This allows us to quantify the dynamic
similarity, a measure of rapport between dynamics of different individuals'
movements, and demonstrate that it facilitates coordination during interaction.
We use our measure to confirm a key prediction of the theory of similarity that
coordination between two individuals performing a joint-action task is higher
if their motions share similar dynamic features. Furthermore, we use a virtual
avatar driven by an interactive cognitive architecture based on feedback
control theory to explore the effects of different kinematic features of the
avatar motion on the coordination with human players.
