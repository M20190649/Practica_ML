Structured psychosocial stress and therapeutic failure
Generalized language-of-thought arguments appropriate to interacting
cognitive modules permit exploration of how disease states interact with
medical treatment. The interpenetrating feedback between treatment and response
to it creates a kind of idiotypic hall-of-mirrors generating a synergistic
pattern of efficacy, treatment failure, adverse reactions, and patient
noncompliance which, from a Rate Distortion perspective, embodies a distorted
image of externally-imposed structured psychosocial stress. For the US,
accelerating spatial and social diffusion of such stress enmeshes both dominant
and subordinate populations in a linked system which will express itself, not
only in an increasingly unhealthy society, but in the diffusion of therapeutic
failure, including, but not limited to, drug-based treatments.
