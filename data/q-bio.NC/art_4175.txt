On the Asymptotic, Near-Equilibrium Sensory Response
The asymptotic, near-equilibrium neural response of the sensory periphery can
be derived theoretically using information theory, asymptotic Bayesian
statistics and a theory of complex systems. Almost no biological knowledge is
required. The theoretical approach is reminiscent of statistical physics.
