Point singularities and suprathreshold stochastic resonance in optimal
  coding
Motivated by recent studies of population coding in theoretical neuroscience,
we examine the optimality of a recently described form of stochastic resonance
known as suprathreshold stochastic resonance, which occurs in populations of
noisy threshold devices such as models of sensory neurons. Using the mutual
information measure, it is shown numerically that for a random input signal,
the optimal threshold distribution contains singularities. For large enough
noise, this distribution consists of a single point and hence the optimal
encoding is realized by the suprathreshold stochastic resonance effect.
Furthermore, it is shown that a bifurcational pattern appears in the optimal
threshold settings as the noise intensity increases. Fisher information is used
to examine the behavior of the optimal threshold distribution as the population
size approaches infinity.
