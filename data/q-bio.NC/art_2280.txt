Cooperation in Neural Systems: Bridging Complexity and Periodicity
Inverse power law distributions are generally interpreted as a manifestation
of complexity, and waiting time distributions with power index \mu < 2 reflect
the occurrence of ergodicity breaking renewal events. In this Letter we show
how to combine these properties with the apparently foreign clocklike nature of
biological processes. We use a two-dimensional regular network of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons, each of which is linked to its four nearest
neighbors, to show that both complexity and periodicity are generated by
locality breakdown: links of increasing strength have the effect of turning
local into long-range interaction, thereby generating first time complexity and
then time periodicity. Increasing the density of neuron firings reduces the
influence of periodicity thus creating a cooperation-induced distinctly
non-Poisson renewal condition.
