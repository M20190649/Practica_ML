Threshold of front propagation in neural fields: An interface dynamics
  approach
Neural field equations model population dynamics of large-scale networks of
neurons. Wave propagation in neural fields is often studied by constructing
traveling wave solutions in the wave coordinate frame. Nonequilibrium dynamics
are more challenging to study, due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality of
neural fields, whose interactions are described by the kernel of an integral
term. Here, we leverage interface methods to describe the threshold of wave
initiation away from equilibrium. In particular, we focus on traveling front
initiation in an excitatory neural field. In a neural field with a Heaviside
firing rate, neural activity can be described by the dynamics of the
interfaces, where the neural activity is at the firing threshold. This allows
us to derive conditions for the portion of the neural field that must be
activated for traveling fronts to be initiated in a purely excitatory neural
field. Explicit equations are possible for a single active (superthreshold)
region, and special cases of multiple disconnected active regions. The dynamic
spreading speed of the excited region can also be approximated asymptotically.
We also discuss extensions to the problem of finding the critical
spatiotemporal input needed to initiate waves.
