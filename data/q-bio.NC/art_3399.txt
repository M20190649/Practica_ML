A Novel Method for Epileptic Seizure Detection Using Coupled Hidden
  Markov Models
We propose a novel Coupled Hidden Markov Model to detect epileptic seizures
in multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) data. Our model defines a network
of seizure propagation paths to capture both the temporal and spatial evolution
of epileptic activity. To address the intractability introduced by the coupled
interactions, we derive a variational inference procedure to efficiently infer
the seizure evolution from spectral patterns in the EEG data. We validate our
model on EEG aquired under clinical conditions in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Using 5-fold cross validation, we demonstrate
that our model outperforms three baseline approaches which rely on a classical
detection framework. Our model also demonstrates the potential to localize
seizure onset zones in focal epilepsy.
