Quantitative evaluation of sense of discrepancy to operation response
  using event-related potential
This study aimed to develop a method to evaluate the sense of discrepancy to
the operation response quantitatively. We examined the availability of
event-related potential (P300), which is considered to reflect attention to
stimulation, to evaluate the sense of discrepancy to the product response to
the user's action. In the experiment using subjective evaluation and P300 to
investigate the sense of discrepancy due to the lack of operation response
(sound and vibration) to the shutter operation of the mirrorless single-lens
camera, it was confirmed that P300 amplitude corresponds to the degree of the
subjective sense of discrepancy. Our results showed that the P300 amplitude
could evaluate the sense of discrepancy to the operation response.
