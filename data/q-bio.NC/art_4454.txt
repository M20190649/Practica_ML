Unveiling causal activity of complex networks
We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing
for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to
be separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that
traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct
but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise.
In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden
features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical
data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that
neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.
