Multilayer Brain Networks
The field of neuroscience is facing an unprecedented expanse in the volume
and diversity of available data. Traditionally, network models have provided
key insights into the structure and function of the brain. With the advent of
big data in neuroscience, both more sophisticated models capable of
characterizing the increasing complexity of the data and novel methods of
quantitative analysis are needed. Recently multilayer networks, a mathematical
extension of traditional networks, have gained increasing popularity in
neuroscience due to their ability to capture the full information of
multi-model, multi-scale, spatiotemporal data sets. Here, we review multilayer
networks and their applications in neuroscience, showing how incorporating the
multilayer framework into network neuroscience analysis has uncovered
previously hidden features of brain networks. We specifically highlight the use
of multilayer networks to model disease, structure-function relationships,
network evolution, and link multi-scale data. Finally, we close with a
discussion of promising new directions of multilayer network neuroscience
research and propose a modified definition of multilayer networks designed to
unite and clarify the use of the multilayer formalism in describing real-world
systems.
