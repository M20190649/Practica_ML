On the coherent behavior of pancreatic beta cell clusters
Beta cells in pancreas represent an example of coupled biological oscillators
which via communication pathways, are able to synchronize their electrical
activity, giving rise to pulsatile insulin release. In this work we numerically
analyze scale free self-similarity features of membrane voltage signal power
density spectrum, through a stochastic dynamical model for beta cells in the
islets of Langerhans fine tuned on mouse experimental data. Adopting the
algebraic approach of coherent state formalism, we show how coherent molecular
domains can arise from proper functional conditions leading to a parallelism
with "phase transition" phenomena of field theory.
