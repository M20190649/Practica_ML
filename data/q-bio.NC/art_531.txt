A Vision Architecture
We are offering a particular interpretation (well within the range of
experimentally and theoretically accepted notions) of neural connectivity and
dynamics and discuss it as the data-and-process architecture of the visual
system. In this interpretation the permanent connectivity of cortex is an
overlay of well-structured networks, nets, which are formed on the slow
time-scale of learning by self-interaction of the network under the influence
of sensory input, and which are selectively activated on the fast perceptual
time-scale. Nets serve as an explicit, hierarchically structured representation
of visual structure in the various sub-modalities, as constraint networks
favouring mutually consistent sets of latent variables and as projection
mappings to deal with invariance.
