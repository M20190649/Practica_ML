Desynchronization in an ensemble of globally coupled chaotic bursting
  neuronal oscillators by dynamic delayed feedback control
In this paper, we propose a dynamic delayed feedback control approach for
desynchronization of chaotic-bursting synchronous activities in an ensemble of
globally coupled neuronal oscillators. We demonstrate that the difference
signal between an ensemble's mean field and its time delayed state, filtered
and fed back to the ensemble, can suppress the self-synchronization in the
ensemble. These individual units are decoupled and stabilized at the desired
desynchronized states while the stimulation signal reduces to the noise level.
The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by examples of two different
populations of globally coupled chaotic-bursting neurons. The proposed method
has potential for mild, effective and demand-controlled therapy of neurological
diseases characterized by pathological synchronization.
