Breakdown of fast-slow analysis in an excitable system with channel
  noise
We consider a stochastic version of an excitable system based on the
Morris-Lecar model of a neuron, in which the noise originates from stochastic
Sodium and Potassium ion channels opening and closing. One can analyze neural
excitability in the deterministic model by using a separation of time scales
involving a fast voltage variable and a slow recovery variable, which
represents the fraction of open Potassium channels. In the stochastic setting,
spontaneous excitation is initiated by ion channel noise. If the recovery
variable is constant during initiation, the spontaneous activity rate can be
calculated using Kramer's rate theory. The validity of this assumption in the
stochastic model is examined using a systematic perturbation analysis. We find
that in most physically relevant cases, this assumption breaks down, requiring
an alternative to Kramers theory for excitable systems with one deterministic
fixed point. We also show that an exit time problem can be formulated in an
excitable system by considering maximum likelihood trajectories of the
stochastic process.
