Diversity improves performance in excitable networks
As few real systems comprise indistinguishable units, diversity is a hallmark
of nature. Diversity among interacting units shapes properties of collective
behavior such as synchronization and information transmission. However, the
benefits of diversity on information processing at the edge of a phase
transition, ordinarily assumed to emerge from identical elements, remain
largely unexplored. Analyzing a general model of excitable systems with
heterogeneous excitability, we find that diversity can greatly enhance optimal
performance (by two orders of magnitude) when distinguishing incoming inputs.
Heterogeneous systems possess a subset of specialized elements whose capability
greatly exceeds that of the nonspecialized elements. Nonetheless, the behavior
of the whole network can outperform all subgroups. We also find that diversity
can yield multiple percolation, with performance optimized at tricriticality.
Our results are robust in specific and more realistic neuronal systems
comprising a combination of excitatory and inhibitory units, and indicate that
diversity-induced amplification can be harnessed by neuronal systems for
evaluating stimulus intensities.
