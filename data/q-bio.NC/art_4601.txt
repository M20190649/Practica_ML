Metabolite transport through glial networks stabilizes the dynamics of
  learning
Learning and memory are acquired through long-lasting changes in synapses. In
the simplest models, such synaptic potentiation typically leads to runaway
excitation, but in reality there must exist processes that robustly preserve
overall stability of the neural system dynamics. How is this accomplished?
Various approaches to this basic question have been considered. Here we propose
a particularly compelling and natural mechanism for preserving stability of
learning neural systems. This mechanism is based on the global processes by
which metabolic resources are distributed to the neurons by glial cells.
Specifically, we introduce and study a model comprised of two interacting
networks: a model neural network interconnected by synapses which undergo
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP); and a model glial network
interconnected by gap junctions which diffusively transport metabolic resources
among the glia and, ultimately, to neural synapses where they are consumed. Our
main result is that the biophysical constraints imposed by diffusive transport
of metabolic resources through the glial network can prevent runaway growth of
synaptic strength, both during ongoing activity and during learning. Our
findings suggest a previously unappreciated role for glial transport of
metabolites in the feedback control stabilization of neural network dynamics
during learning.
