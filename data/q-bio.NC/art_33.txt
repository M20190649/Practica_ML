How to compute using globally coupled oscillators
Synchronization is known to play a vital role within many highly connected
neural systems such as the olfactory systems of fish and insects. In this paper
we show how one can robustly and effectively perform practical computations
using small perturbations to a very simple globally coupled network of coupled
oscillators. Computations are performed by exploiting the spatio-temporal
dynamics of a robust attracting heteroclinic network (also referred to as
`winnerless competition' dynamics). We use different cluster synchronization
states to encode memory states and use this to design a simple multi-base
counter. The simulations indicate that this gives a robust computational system
exploiting the natural dynamics of the system.
