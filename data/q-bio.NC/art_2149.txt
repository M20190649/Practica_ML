State sampling dependence of the Hopfield network inference
The fully connected Hopfield network is inferred based on observed
magnetizations and pairwise correlations. We present the system in the glassy
phase with low temperature and high memory load. We find that the inference
error is very sensitive to the form of state sampling. When a single state is
sampled to compute magnetizations and correlations, the inference error is
almost indistinguishable irrespective of the sampled state. However, the error
can be greatly reduced if the data is collected with state transitions. Our
result holds for different disorder samples and accounts for the previously
observed large fluctuations of inference error at low temperatures.
