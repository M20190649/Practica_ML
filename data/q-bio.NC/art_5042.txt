Information Flow in Computational Systems
We develop a theoretical framework for defining and identifying flows of
information in computational systems. Here, a computational system is assumed
to be a directed graph, with "clocked" nodes that send transmissions to each
other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. A few measures
of information flow have been proposed previously in the literature, and
measures of directed causal influence are currently being used as a heuristic
proxy for information flow. However, there is as yet no rigorous treatment of
the problem with formal definitions and clearly stated assumptions, and the
process of defining information flow is often conflated with the problem of
estimating it. In this work, we provide a new information-theoretic definition
for information flow in a computational system, which we motivate using a
series of examples. We then show that this definition satisfies intuitively
desirable properties, including the existence of "information paths", along
which information flows from the input of the computational system to its
output. Finally, we describe how information flow might be estimated in a
noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on
the time-unrolled graph of a computational system.
