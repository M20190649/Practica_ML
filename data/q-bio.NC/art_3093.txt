Time Fractional Cable Equation And Applications in Neurophysiology
We propose an extension of the cable equation by introducing a Caputo time
fractional derivative. The fundamental solutions of the most common boundary
problems are derived analitically via Laplace Transform, and result be written
in terms of known special functions. This generalization could be useful to
describe anomalous diffusion phenomena with leakage as signal conduction in
spiny dendrites. The presented solutions are computed in Matlab and plotted.
