Kurt Lewin, psychological constructs and sources of brain cognitive
  activity
Understanding mind-brain-environment relations is one of the key topics in
psychology. Kurt Lewin, inspired by theoretical physics, tried to establish
topological and vector psychology analyzing patterns of interaction between the
individual and her/his environment. The time is ripe to reformulate his
ambitious goals, searching for ways to interpret objectively measured brain
processes in terms of suitable psychological constructs. Connecting cognitive
and social psychology constructs to neurophenomics, as it is done now in
psychiatry, should ground them in physical reality.
