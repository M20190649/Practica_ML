The derivation of continuum limits of neuronal networks with
  gap-junction couplings
We consider an idealized network, formed by N neurons individually described
by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations and connected by electrical synapses. The
limit for N to infinity of the resulting discrete model is thoroughly
investigated, with the aim of identifying a model for a continuum of neurons
having an equivalent behaviour. Two strategies for passing to the limit are
analysed: i) a more conventional approach, based on a fixed nearest-neighbour
connection topology accompanied by a suitable scaling of the diffusion
coefficients; ii) a new approach, in which the number of connections to any
given neuron varies with N according to a precise law, which simultaneously
guarantees the non-triviality of the limit and the locality of neuronal
interactions. Both approaches yield in the limit a pde-based model, in which
the distribution of action potential obeys a nonlinear
reaction-convection-diffusion equation; convection accounts for the possible
lack of symmetry in the connection topology. Several convergence issues are
discussed, both theoretically and numerically.
