When can dictionary learning uniquely recover sparse data from
  subsamples?
Sparse coding or sparse dictionary learning has been widely used to recover
underlying structure in many kinds of natural data. Here, we provide conditions
guaranteeing when this recovery is universal; that is, when sparse codes and
dictionaries are unique (up to natural symmetries). Our main tool is a useful
lemma in combinatorial matrix theory that allows us to derive bounds on the
sample sizes guaranteeing such uniqueness under various assumptions for how
training data are generated. Whenever the conditions to one of our theorems are
met, any sparsity-constrained learning algorithm that succeeds in
reconstructing the data recovers the original sparse codes and dictionary. We
also discuss potential applications to neuroscience and data analysis.
