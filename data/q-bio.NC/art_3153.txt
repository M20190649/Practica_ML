Multi-Scale Factor Analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Signals
In this paper, we develop an approach to modeling high-dimensional networks
with a large number of nodes arranged in a hierarchical and modular structure.
We propose a novel multi-scale factor analysis (MSFA) model which partitions
the massive spatio-temporal data defined over the complex networks into a
finite set of regional clusters. To achieve further dimension reduction, we
represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The
correlation matrix for all nodes in the network are approximated by
lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To
estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we
apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived
as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss.
Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based
on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the cross-dependence
measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale
analysis of both regional and global dependencies of the large networks. The
proposed novel approach is applied to estimate brain connectivity networks
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Results on
resting-state fMRI reveal interesting modular and hierarchical organization of
human brain networks during rest.
