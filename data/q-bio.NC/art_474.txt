The Scalable Brain Atlas: instant web-based access to public brain
  atlases and related content
The Scalable Brain Atlas (SBA) is a collection of web services that provide
unified access to a large collection of brain atlas templates for different
species. Its main component is an atlas viewer that displays brain atlas data
as a stack of slices in which stereotaxic coordinates and brain regions can be
selected. These are subsequently used to launch web queries to resources that
require coordinates or region names as input. It supports plugins which run
inside the viewer and respond when a new slice, coordinate or region is
selected. It contains 20 atlas templates in six species, and plugins to compute
coordinate transformations, display anatomical connectivity and fiducial
points, and retrieve properties, descriptions, definitions and 3d
reconstructions of brain regions. The ambition of SBA is to provide a unified
representation of all publicly available brain atlases directly in the web
browser, while remaining a responsive and light weight resource that
specializes in atlas comparisons, searches, coordinate transformations and
interactive displays.
