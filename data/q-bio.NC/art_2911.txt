Stability and Localization of inter-individual differences in functional
  connectivity
Much recent attention has been paid to quantifying anatomic and functional
neuroimaging on the individual subject level. For optimal individual subject
characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be
identified that maximize inter-individual variability while concomitantly
minimizing intra-subject variability. Here we develop a non-parametric
statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows
this individual subject differentiation. We apply this metric to analyzing
publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find
that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, there is a
relative tradeoff between increasing sampling through increased sampling
frequency or increased acquisition time; that for the sizes of the interrogated
data sets, only 4-5 min of acquisition time is necessary to perfectly
differentiate each subject; and that brain regions that most contribute to
individuals unique characterization lie in association cortices thought to
contribute to higher cognitive function. These findings may guide optimal
rs-fMRI experiment design and may aid elucidation of the neural bases for
subject-to-subject differences.
