On Simplicity and Complexity in the Brave New World of Large-Scale
  Neuroscience
Technological advances have dramatically expanded our ability to probe
multi-neuronal dynamics and connectivity in the brain. However, our ability to
extract a simple conceptual understanding from complex data is increasingly
hampered by the lack of theoretically principled data analytic procedures, as
well as theoretical frameworks for how circuit connectivity and dynamics can
conspire to generate emergent behavioral and cognitive functions. We review and
outline potential avenues for progress, including new theories of high
dimensional data analysis, the need to analyze complex artificial networks, and
methods for analyzing entire spaces of circuit models, rather than one model at
a time. Such interplay between experiments, data analysis and theory will be
indispensable in catalyzing conceptual advances in the age of large-scale
neuroscience.
