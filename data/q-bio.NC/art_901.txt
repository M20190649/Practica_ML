New approaches for CMOS-based devices for large-scale neural recording
Extracellular, large scale in vivo recording of neural activity is mandatory
for elucidating the interaction of neurons within large neural networks at the
level of their single unit activity. Technological achievements in MEMS-based
multichannel electrode arrays offer electrophysiological recording capabilities
that go far beyond those of classical wire electrodes. Despite their impressive
channel counts, recording systems with modest interconnection overhead have
been demonstrated thanks to the hybrid integration of CMOS circuitry for signal
preprocessing and data handling. The number of addressable channels is
increased even further by a switch matrix for electrode selection co-integrated
along the slender probe shafts. When realized by IC fabrication technologies,
these probes offer highest recording site densities along the entire shaft
length.
