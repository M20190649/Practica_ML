Regulation of Irregular Neuronal Firing by Autaptic Transmission
The importance of self-feedback autaptic transmission in modulating
spike-time irregularity is still poorly understood. By using a biophysical
model that incorporates autaptic coupling, we here show that self-innervation
of neurons participates in the modulation of irregular neuronal firing,
primarily by regulating the occurrence frequency of burst firing. In
particular, we find that both excitatory and electrical autapses increase the
occurrence of burst firing, thus reducing neuronal firing regularity. In
contrast, inhibitory autapses suppress burst firing and therefore tend to
improve the regularity of neuronal firing. Importantly, we show that these
findings are independent of the firing properties of individual neurons, and as
such can be observed for neurons operating in different modes. Our results
provide an insightful mechanistic understanding of how different types of
autapses shape irregular firing at the single-neuron level, and they highlight
the functional importance of autaptic self-innervation in taming and modulating
neurodynamics.
