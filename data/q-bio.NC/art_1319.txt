Occipital and left temporal EEG correlates of phenomenal consciousness
In the first section, Introduction, we present our experimental design. In
the second section, we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal
electrical activity correlated with a contrast in access. In the third section,
we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity
correlated with a contrast in phenomenology and conclude characterizing the
grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity co-occurring with
unconsciousness.
