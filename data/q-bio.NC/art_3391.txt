Human peripheral blur is optimal for object recognition
Our vision is sharpest at the center of our gaze and becomes progressively
blurry into the periphery. It is widely believed that this high foveal
resolution evolved at the expense of peripheral acuity. But what if this
sampling scheme is actually optimal for object recognition? To test this
hypothesis, we trained deep neural networks on 'foveated' images with high
resolution near objects and increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery.
Neural networks trained using a blur profile matching the human eye yielded the
best performance compared to shallower and steeper blur profiles. Even in
humans, categorization accuracy deteriorated only for steeper blur profiles.
Thus, our blurry peripheral vision may have evolved to optimize object
recognition rather than merely due to wiring constraints.
