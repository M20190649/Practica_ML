What Colour is Neural Noise?
Random noise plays a beneficial role in cognitive processing and produces
measurable improvement in simulations and biological agents' task performance.
Stochastic facilitation, the phenomenon of additive noise improving signal
transmission in complex systems, has been shown to occur in a variety of neural
contexts. However, neuroscience analyses to date have not fully explored the
colours that neural noise could be. The literature shows a 1/f pink noise power
spectrum distribution at many levels, but many less rigourous studies assume
white noise, with little justification of why that assumption is made. In this
work, we briefly review the colours of noise and their useful applications in
other fields. If we consider that noise is not so black and white, we could
more colourfully regularize artificial neural networks and re-investigate some
surprising results about how the brain benefits from noise.
