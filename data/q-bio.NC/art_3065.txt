A defense of using resting state fMRI as null data for estimating false
  positive rates
A recent Editorial by Slotnick (2017) reconsiders the findings of our paper
on the accuracy of false positive rate control with cluster inference in fMRI
(Eklund et al, 2016), in particular criticising our use of resting state fMRI
data as a source for null data in the evaluation of task fMRI methods. We
defend this use of resting fMRI data, as while there is much structure in this
data, we argue it is representative of task data noise and as such analysis
software should be able to accommodate this noise. We also discuss a potential
problem with Slotnick's own method.
