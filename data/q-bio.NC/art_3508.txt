Adaptive Internal Models: Explaining the Oculomotor System and the
  Cerebellum
We propose a new model of the oculomotor system, particularly the
vestibulo-ocular reflex, the optokinetic reflex, gaze fixation, and smooth
pursuit. Our key insight is to exploit recent developments on adaptive internal
models. The outcome is a simple model that includes the interactions between
the brainstem and the cerebellum and that recovers behaviors from more than 15
oculomotor experiments. In addition, we put forward a thesis that the
cerebellum embodies internal models of all persistent, exogenous reference and
disturbance signals acting on the body and observable through the error signals
it receives. Our proposed architecture is compared to feedback error learning,
a variant of the computed torque method in robotics and currently the best
developed computational architecture for the cerebellum.
