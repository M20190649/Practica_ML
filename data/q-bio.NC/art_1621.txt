Spared cognitive and behavioral functions prior to epilepsy onset in a
  rat model of 2 subcortical band heteropia
13 Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as doublecortex syndrome,
is a 14 malformation of cortical development resulting from mutations in the
doublecortin gene 15 (DCX). It is characterized by a lack of migration of
cortical neurons that accumulate in the 16 white matter forming a heterotopic
band. Patients with SBH may present mild to moderate 17 intellectual disability
as well as epilepsy. The SBH condition can be modeled in rats by in 18 utero
knockdown (KD) of Dcx. The affected cells form an SBH reminiscent of that
observed in 19 human patients and the animals develop a chronic epileptic
condition in adulthood. Here, 20 we investigated if the presence of an SBH is
sufficient to induce cognitive impairment in 21
