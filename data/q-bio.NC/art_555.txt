Untersuchungen zur Implementierung von Bildverarbeitungsalgorithmen
  mittels pulsgekoppelter neuronaler Netze
This thesis deals with the study of image processing algorithms which can be
implemented by pulse-coupled neural nets. The inspiration for this choice is
taken from biological image processing, which achieves with little
computational effort in highly parallel processes image analysis tasks such as
object recognition, image segmentation, velocity and distance estimation, etc.
Conventional, serially implemented algorithms either cannot realize those tasks
at all or will expend significantly more effort. Because the first stages of
the visual system comprise a sensor interface, they are comparatively
accessible with respect to defining their transfer or processing function. Some
of those processing functions or principles are to be used in hardware
implementations, with the focus on duplicating especially the highly parallel
processing.
