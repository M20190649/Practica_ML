Mapping brain activity with flexible graphene micro-transistors
Establishing a reliable communication interface between the brain and
electronic devices is of paramount importance for exploiting the full potential
of neural prostheses. Current microelectrode technologies for recording
electrical activity, however, evidence important shortcomings, e.g. challenging
high density integration. Solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs), on
the other hand, could overcome these shortcomings if a suitable transistor
material were available. Graphene is particularly attractive due to its
biocompatibility, chemical stability, flexibility, low intrinsic electronic
noise and high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we report on the use of an
array of flexible graphene SGFETs for recording spontaneous slow waves, as well
as visually evoked and also pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The
flexible array of graphene SGFETs allows mapping brain electrical activity with
excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting that this technology could
lay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo recording implants.
