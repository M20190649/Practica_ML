Synaptic Plasticity and Spike Synchronisation in Neuronal Networks
Brain plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, is a fundamental mechanism
of neuronal adaptation in response to changes in the environment or due to
brain injury. In this review, we show our results about the effects of synaptic
plasticity on neuronal networks composed by Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We show
that the final topology of the evolved network depends crucially on the ratio
between the strengths of the inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Excitation of
the same order of inhibition revels an evolved network that presents the
rich-club phenomenon, well known to exist in the brain. For initial networks
with considerably larger inhibitory strengths, we observe the emergence of a
complex evolved topology, where neurons sparsely connected to other neurons,
also a typical topology of the brain. The presence of noise enhances the
strength of both types of synapses, but if the initial network has synapses of
both natures with similar strengths. Finally, we show how the synchronous
behaviour of the evolved network will reflect its evolved topology.
