A Theoretical Solution of the Mind-Body Problem: An Operationalized
  Proof that no Purely Physical System Can Exhibit all the Properties of Human
  Consciousness
This article presents an operationalized solution to the mind-body problem
which relies on rigorously defined theoretical reasoning rather than
philosophical argument. We identify a specific operation which is a necessary
property of all healthy human conscious individuals -- specifically the
operation of self-certainty, or the capacity of healthy conscious humans to
"know" with certainty that they are conscious. This operation is shown to be
inconsistent with the properties possible in any meaningful definition of a
physical system. This inconsistency is demonstrated by proving a "no-go"
theorem for any physical system capable of human logical reasoning, if this
reasoning is required to be both sound and consistent. The proof of this
theorem is both general -- it applies to any function whereby evidence affects
the state of some physical system -- and recursive, since any physical process
subserving a function of this type is shown to imply another such function.
Thus for at least one aspect of human consciousness, the mind-body problem is
now conclusively resolved.
