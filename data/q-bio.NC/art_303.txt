Phase lagging model of brain response to external stimuli - modeling of
  single action potential
In this paper we detail a phase lagging model of brain response to external
stimuli. The model is derived using the basic laws of physics like conservation
of energy law. This model eliminates the paradox of instantaneous propagation
of the action potential in the brain. The solution of this model is then
presented. The model is further applied in the case of a single neuron and is
verified by simulating a single action potential. The results of this modeling
are useful not only for the fundamental understanding of single action
potential generation, but also they can be applied in case of neuronal
interactions where the results can be verified against the real EEG signal.
