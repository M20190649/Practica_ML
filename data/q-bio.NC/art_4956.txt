Noninvasive Blockade of Action Potential by Electromagnetic Induction
Conventional anesthesia methods such as injective anesthetic agents may cause
various side effects such as injuries, allergies, and infections. We aim to
investigate a noninvasive scheme of an electromagnetic radiator system to block
action potential (AP) in neuron fibers. We achieved a high-gradient and
unipolar tangential electric field by designing circular geometric coils on an
electric rectifier filter layer. An asymmetric sawtooth pulse shape supplied
the coils in order to create an effective blockage. The entire setup was placed
5 cm above 50 motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord. A validated
time-domain full-wave analysis code Based on cable model of the neurons and the
electric and magnetic potentials is used to simulate and investigate the
proposed scheme. We observed action potential blockage on both motor and
sensory neurons. In addition, the introduced approach shows promising potential
for AP manipulation in the spinal cord.
