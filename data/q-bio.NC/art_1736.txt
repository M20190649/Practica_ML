Neural coding of fast frequency modulated sweeps
Frequency modulation (FM) is a basic constituent of vocalisation. Formant
transitions in speech are characterised by short rising and falling FM-sweeps
in the kilohertz frequency range. These sounds elicit a pitch percept that
deviates from their average frequency. This study uses this perceptual effect,
termed here the sweep pitch shift, to inform a model characterising the neural
encoding of FM. First, a reexamination of the classical effect, consisting of
two perceptual experiments, provides a quantitative characterisation of the
dependence of the sweep pitch shift with the properties of the sweeps. Next,
simulations carried on the new experimental data show that classical temporal
and spectral models of pitch processing cannot explain the pitch shift.
Conversely, a modified spectral model considering a predictive interaction
between frequency and FM encoding fully reproduces our and previous
experimental data. The model introduces a feedback mechanism that modulates the
neurons that are expected to respond to future portions of the sweeps,
accelarating their onset response. Combined, the experimental and modelling
results suggest that predictive feedback modulation plays an important role in
the neural encoding of FM even at early stages of the processing hierarchy.
