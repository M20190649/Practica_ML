No evidence for critical slowing down prior to human epileptic seizures
There is a ongoing debate whether generic early warning signals for critical
transitions exist that can be applied across diverse systems. The human
epileptic brain is often considered as a prototypical system, given the
devastating and, at times, even life-threatening nature of the extreme event
epileptic seizure. More than three decades of international effort has
successfully identified predictors of imminent seizures. However, the
suitability of typically applied early warning indicators for critical slowing
down, namely variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, for indexing seizure
susceptibility is still controversially discussed. Here, we investigated
long-term, multichannel recordings of brain dynamics from 28 subjects with
epilepsy. Using a surrogate-based evaluation procedure of sensitivity and
specificity of time-resolved estimates of early warning indicators, we found no
evidence for critical slowing down prior to 105 epileptic seizures.
