An experimental evidence-based computational paradigm for new
  logic-gates in neuronal activity
We propose a new experimentally corroborated paradigm in which the
functionality of the brain's logic-gates depends on the history of their
activity, e.g. an OR-gate that turns into a XOR-gate over time. Our results are
based on an experimental procedure where conditioned stimulations were enforced
on circuits of neurons embedded within a large-scale network of cortical cells
in-vitro. The underlying biological mechanism is the unavoidable increase of
neuronal response latency to ongoing stimulations, which imposes a non-uniform
gradual stretching of network delays.
