Dimensions of Kernel Abstractions: A Theory on Neurobiology and
  Cognitive Functioning
The ability to create abstract categorizations to be reused in different
contexts is one of the most critical abilities for intelligent behavior. In
this letter, we present a proposal for how neurobiological structure plays a
role in this ability. We introduce two terms: kernel and kernel dimension. The
first to describe what the abstraction is and the second to numerically
quantify the first. Based on the common abnormalities in both biological
structure and cognitive functioning of two psychiatric disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, we hypothesize that the density of the dendritic spines in the
pyramidal neurons of the Prefrontal Cortex determines the dimension. We show
the computational validity of our claims by making two demonstrations with
artificial intelligence - one to show that structural density can effect kernel
dimension and the other to show that cognitive functioning is effected by the
dimension of the kernel.
