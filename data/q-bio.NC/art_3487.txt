Modeling the respiratory Central Pattern Generator with
  resonate-and-fire Izhikevich-Neurons
Computational models of the respiratory central pattern generator (rCPG) are
usually based on biologically-plausible Hodgkin Huxley neuron models. Such
models require numerous parameters and thus are prone to overfitting. The HH
approach is motivated by the assumption that the biophysical properties of
neurons determine the network dynamics. Here, we implement the rCPG using
simpler Izhikevich resonate-and-fire neurons. Our rCPG model generates a
3-phase respiratory motor pattern based on established connectivities and can
reproduce previous experimental and theoretical observations. Further, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the model by testing whether intrinsic bursting
properties are necessary for rhythmogenesis. Our simulations demonstrate that
replacing predicted mandatory bursting properties of pre-inspiratory neurons
with spike adapting properties yields a model that generates comparable
respiratory activity patterns. The latter supports our view that the importance
of the exact modeling parameters of specific respiratory neurons is
overestimated.
