Decorrelation by recurrent inhibition in heterogeneous neural circuits
The activity of neurons is correlated, and this correlation affects how the
brain processes information. We study the neural circuit mechanisms of
correlations by analyzing a network model characterized by strong and
heterogeneous interactions: excitatory input drives the fluctuations of neural
activity, which are counterbalanced by inhibitory feedback. In particular,
excitatory input tends to correlate neurons, while inhibitory feedback reduces
correlations. We demonstrate that heterogeneity of synaptic connections is
necessary for this inhibition of correlations. We calculate statistical
averages over the disordered synaptic interactions, and we apply our findings
to both a simple linear model and to a more realistic spiking network model. We
find that correlations at zero time-lag are positive and of magnitude K^{-1/2},
where K is the number of connections to a neuron. Correlations at longer
timescales are of smaller magnitude, of order K^{-1}, implying that inhibition
of correlations occurs quickly, on a timescale of K^{-1/2}. The small magnitude
of correlations agrees qualitatively with physiological measurements in the
Cerebral Cortex and Basal Ganglia. The model could be used to study
correlations in brain regions dominated by recurrent inhibition, such as the
Striatum and Globus Pallidus.
