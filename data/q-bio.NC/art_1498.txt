Scaling Spike Detection and Sorting for Next Generation
  Electrophysiology
Reliable spike detection and sorting, the process of assigning each detected
spike to its originating neuron, is an essential step in the analysis of
extracellular electrical recordings from neurons. The volume and complexity of
the data from recently developed large scale, high density microelectrode
arrays and probes, which allow recording from thousands of channels
simultaneously, substantially complicate this task conceptually and
computationally. This chapter provides a summary and discussion of recently
developed methods to tackle these challenges, and discuss the important aspect
of algorithm validation, and assessment of detection and sorting quality.
