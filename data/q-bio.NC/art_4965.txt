Cross-Subject Transfer Learning Improves the Practicality of Real-World
  Applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces
Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) have shown its robustness in facilitating high-efficiency communication.
State-of-the-art training-based SSVEP decoding methods such as extended
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA)
are the major players that elevate the efficiency of the SSVEP-based BCIs
through a calibration process. However, due to notable human variability across
individuals and within individuals over time, calibration (training) data
collection is non-negligible and often laborious and time-consuming,
deteriorating the practicality of SSVEP BCIs in a real-world context. This
study aims to develop a cross-subject transferring approach to reduce the need
for collecting training data from a test user with a newly proposed
least-squares transformation (LST) method. Study results show the capability of
the LST in reducing the number of training templates required for a 40-class
SSVEP BCI. The LST method may lead to numerous real-world applications using
near-zero-training/plug-and-play high-speed SSVEP BCIs.
