Persistent memories in transient networks
Spatial awareness in mammals is based on an internalized representation of
the environment, encoded by large networks of spiking neurons. While such
representations can last for a long time, the underlying neuronal network is
transient: neuronal cells die every day, synaptic connections appear and
disappear, the networks constantly change their architecture due to various
forms of synaptic and structural plasticity. How can a network with a dynamic
architecture encode a stable map of space? We address this question using a
physiological model of a "flickering" neuronal network and demonstrate that it
can maintain a robust topological representation of space.
