Use of an Hourglass Model in Neuronal Coding
We study a system of interacting renewal processes which is a model for
neuronal activity. We show that the system possesses an exponentially large
number (with respect to the number of neurons in the network) of limiting
configurations of the "firing neurons". These we call patterns. Furthermore,
under certain conditions of symmetry we find an algorithm to control limiting
patterns by means of the connection parameters.
