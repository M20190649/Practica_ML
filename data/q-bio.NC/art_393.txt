A methodology for detecting and exploring non-convulsive seizures in
  patients with SAH
A methodology for understanding and de- tecting nonconvulsive seizures in
individuals with sub- arachnoid hemorrhage is introduced. Specifically, begin-
ning with an EEG signal, the power spectrum is esti- mated yielding a
multivariate time series which is then ana- lyzed using empirical orthogonal
functional analysis. This methodology allows for easy identification and
observation of seizures that are otherwise only identifiable though ex- pert
analysis of the raw EEG.
