A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Uncovering Rat Hippocampal
  Population Codes During Spatial Navigation
Rodent hippocampal population codes represent important spatial information
about the environment during navigation. Several computational methods have
been developed to uncover the neural representation of spatial topology
embedded in rodent hippocampal ensemble spike activity. Here we extend our
previous work and propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach to infer rat
hippocampal population codes during spatial navigation. To tackle the model
selection problem, we leverage a nonparametric Bayesian model. Specifically, to
analyze rat hippocampal ensemble spiking activity, we apply a hierarchical
Dirichlet process-hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) using two Bayesian inference
methods, one based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the other based on
variational Bayes (VB). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Bayesian
approaches on recordings from a freely-behaving rat navigating in an open field
environment. We find that MCMC-based inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) hyperparameter sampling is flexible and efficient, and outperforms VB and
MCMC approaches with hyperparameters set by empirical Bayes.
