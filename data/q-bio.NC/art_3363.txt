A quantized physical framework for understanding the working mechanism
  of ion channels
A quantized physical framework, called the five-anchor model, is developed
for a general understanding of the working mechanism of ion channels. According
to the hypotheses of this model, the following two basic physical principles
are assigned to each anchor: the polarity change induced by an electron
transition and the mutual repulsion and attraction induced by an electrostatic
force. Consequently, many unique phenomena, such as fast and slow inactivation,
the stochastic gating pattern and constant conductance of a single ion channel,
the difference between electrical and optical stimulation (optogenetics), nerve
conduction block and the generation of an action potential, become intrinsic
features of this physical model. Moreover, this model also provides a
foundation for the probability equation used to calculate the results of
electrical stimulation in our previous C-P theory.
