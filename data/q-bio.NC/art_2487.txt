Exact detection of direct links in networks of interacting dynamical
  units
The inference of an underlying network topology from local observations of a
complex system composed of interacting units is usually attempted by using
statistical similarity measures, such as Cross-Correlation (CC) and Mutual
Information (MI). The possible existence of a direct link between different
units is, however, hindered within the time-series measurements. Here we show
that, for the class of systems studied, when an abrupt change in the ordered
set of CC or MI values exists, it is possible to infer, without errors, the
underlying network topology from the time-series measurements, even in the
presence of observational noise, non-identical units, and coupling
heterogeneity. We find that a necessary condition for the discontinuity to
occur is that the dynamics of the coupled units is partially coherent, i.e.,
neither complete disorder nor globally synchronous patterns are present. We
critically compare the inference methods based on CC and MI, in terms of how
effective, robust, and reliable they are, and conclude that, in general, MI
outperforms CC in robustness and reliability. Our findings could be relevant
for the construction and interpretation of functional networks, such as those
constructed from brain or climate data.
