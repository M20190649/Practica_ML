A hierarchical neural stimulation model for pain relief by variation of
  coil design parameters
Neural stimulation represents a powerful technique for neural disorder
treatment. This paper deals with optimization of coil design parameters to be
used during stimulation for modulation of neuronal firing to achieve pain
relief. Pain mechanism is briefly introduced and a hierarchical stimulation
model from coil stimulation to neuronal firing is proposed. Electromagnetic
field distribution for circular, figure of 8 and Magnetic resonance coupling
figure of 8 coils are analyzed with respect to the variation of stimulation
parameters such as distance between coils, stimulation frequency, number of
turns and radius of coils. MRC figure of 8 coils were responsible for inducing
the maximum Electric field for same amount of driving current in coils.
Variation of membrane potential, ion channel conductance and neuronal firing
frequency in a pyramidal neuronal model due to magnetic and acoustic
stimulation are studied. The frequency of neuronal firing for cortical neurons
is higher during pain state, compared to no pain state. Lowest neuronal firing
frequency 18 Hz was found for MRC figure of 8 coils, compared to 30 Hz for
circular coils. Therefore, MRC figure of 8 coils are most effective for
modulation of neuronal firing, thereby achieving pain relief in comparison to
other coils considered in this study
