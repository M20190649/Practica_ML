Visual Decisions in the Presence of Measurement and Stimulus
  Correlations
Humans and other animals base their decisions on noisy sensory input. Much
work has therefore been devoted to understanding the computations that underly
such decisions. The problem has been studied in a variety of tasks and with
stimuli of differing complexity. However, the impact of correlations in sensory
noise on perceptual judgments is not well understood. Here we examine how
stimulus correlations together with correlations in sensory noise impact
decision making. As an example, we consider the task of detecting the presence
of a single or multiple targets amongst distractors. We assume that both the
distractors and the observer's measurements of the stimuli are correlated. The
computations of an optimal observer in this task are nontrivial, yet can be
analyzed and understood intuitively. We find that when distractors are strongly
correlated, measurement correlations can have a strong impact on performance.
When distractor correlations are weak, measurement correlations have little
impact, unless the number of stimuli is large. Correlations in neural responses
to structured stimuli can therefore strongly impact perceptual judgments.
