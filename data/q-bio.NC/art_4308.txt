Avoiding catastrophic failure in correlated networks of networks
Networks in nature do not act in isolation but instead exchange information,
and depend on each other to function properly. An incipient theory of Networks
of Networks have shown that connected random networks may very easily result in
abrupt failures. This theoretical finding bares an intrinsic paradox: If
natural systems organize in interconnected networks, how can they be so stable?
Here we provide a solution to this conundrum, showing that the stability of a
system of networks relies on the relation between the internal structure of a
network and its pattern of connections to other networks. Specifically, we
demonstrate that if network inter-connections are provided by hubs of the
network and if there is a moderate degree of convergence of inter-network
connection the systems of network are stable and robust to failure. We test
this theoretical prediction in two independent experiments of functional brain
networks (in task- and resting states) which show that brain networks are
connected with a topology that maximizes stability according to the theory.
