Sparse Functional Identification of Complex Cells from Spike Times and
  the Decoding of Visual Stimuli
We investigate the sparse functional identification of complex cells and the
decoding of visual stimuli encoded by an ensemble of complex cells. The
reconstruction algorithm of both temporal and spatio-temporal stimuli is
formulated as a rank minimization problem that significantly reduces the number
of sampling measurements (spikes) required for decoding. We also establish the
duality between sparse decoding and functional identification, and provide
algorithms for identification of low-rank dendritic stimulus processors. The
duality enables us to efficiently evaluate our functional identification
algorithms by reconstructing novel stimuli in the input space. Finally, we
demonstrate that our identification algorithms substantially outperform the
generalized quadratic model, the non-linear input model and the widely used
spike-triggered covariance algorithm.
