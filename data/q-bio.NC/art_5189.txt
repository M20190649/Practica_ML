DISCo for the CIA: Deep learning, Instance Segmentation, and
  Correlations for Calcium Imaging Analysis
Calcium imaging is one of the most important tools in neurophysiology as it
enables the observation of neuronal activity for hundreds of cells in parallel
and at single-cell resolution. In order to use the data gained with calcium
imaging, it is necessary to extract individual cells and their activity from
the recordings. Although many sophisticated methods have been proposed, the
cell extraction from calcium imaging data can still be prohibitively laborious
and require manual annotation and correction. We present DISCo, a novel
approach for the cell segmentation in Calcium Imaging Analysis (CIA) that
combines the advantages of Deep learning with a state-of-the-art Instance
Segmentation algorithm and uses temporal information from the recordings in a
computationally efficient way by computing Correlations between pixels.
