Evolution of cooperation and communication skills as a consequence of
  environment fluctuations
Dynamics of a social population is analyzed taking into account some physical
constraints on individual behavior and decision making abilities. The model,
based on Evolutionary Game Theory, predicts that a population has to pass
through a series of different games, e.g as a consequence of environmental
fluctuations, in order to develop social cooperation and communication skills.
It differs from the general assumption that evolution of cooperation, the so
called Cooperation Paradox, can be explained by a single set of rules for
intra-population competitions. The developed methods, potentially, have a
practical value for some learning optimization problems in multiagent, e.g.
corporate, environment.
