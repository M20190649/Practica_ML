Time irreversibility of resting brain activity in the healthy brain and
  pathology
Characterising brain activity at rest is of paramount importance to our
understanding both of general principles of brain functioning and of the way
brain dynamics is affected in the presence of neurological or psychiatric
pathologies. We measured the time-reversal symmetry of spontaneous
electroencephalographic brain activity recorded from three groups of patients
and their respective control group under two experimental conditions (eyes open
and closed). We evaluated differences in time irreversibility in terms of
possible underlying physical generating mechanisms. The results showed that
resting brain activity is generically time-irreversible at sufficiently long
time scales, and that brain pathology is generally associated with a reduction
in time-asymmetry, albeit with pathology-specific patterns. The significance of
these results and their possible dynamical aetiology are discussed. Some
implications of the differential modulation of time asymmetry by pathology and
experimental condition are examined.
