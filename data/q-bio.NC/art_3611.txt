Contextuality in Human Decision Making in the Presence of Direct
  Influences: A Comment on Basieva et al. (2019)
In a recent paper Basieva, Cervantes, Dzhafarov, and Khrennikov (2019)
presented a series of experiments which they claimed show evidence for
contextuality in human judgments. This was based on a set of modified Bell-like
inequalities designed to rule out effects caused by signalling. In this comment
we show that it is, however, possible to construct a non-contextual model which
explains the experimental data via direct influences. We trace the apparent
inconsistency to a definition of signalling which does not account for all
possible forms of direct influence. Further, we cast doubt on the idea that any
experimental data in psychology could provide conclusive evidence for
contextuality.
