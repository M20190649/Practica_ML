A Survey on Deep Learning based Brain Computer Interface: Recent
  Advances and New Frontiers
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) bridges the human's neural world and the outer
physical world by decoding individuals' brain signals into commands
recognizable by computer devices. Deep learning has lifted the performance of
brain-computer interface systems significantly in recent years. In this
article, we systematically investigate brain signal types for BCI and related
deep learning concepts for brain signal analysis. We then present a
comprehensive survey of deep learning techniques used for BCI, by summarizing
over 230 contributions most published in the past five years. Finally, we
discuss the applied areas, opening challenges, and future directions for deep
learning-based BCI.
