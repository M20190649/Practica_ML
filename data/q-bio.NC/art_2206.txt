Theoretical frameworks for neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice
Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics,
econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have
mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic
inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been
extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent
advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice
have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in
intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the
new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.
The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations
of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,
cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.
