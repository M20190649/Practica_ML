Gap junction plasticity as a mechanism to regulate network-wide
  oscillations
Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions
and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations.
One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap-junctional coupling. Gap
junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover,
recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an
activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that
activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate
oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction
plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that gap junction
plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining
a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and
synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust
communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms:
transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct
functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in
cortex.
