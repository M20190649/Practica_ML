Information Processing in Brain Microtubules
Models of the mind are based on the possibility of computing in brain
microtubules. From this point of view, information processing is the
fundamental issue for understanding the brain mechanisms that produce
consciousness. The cytoskeleton polymers could store and process information
through their dynamic coupling mediated by mechanical energy. We analyze the
problem of information transfer and storage in brain microtubules, considering
them as a communication channel. We discuss the implications of assuming that
consciousness is generated by the subneuronal process.
