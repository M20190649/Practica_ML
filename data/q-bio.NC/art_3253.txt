Hyperplane Neural Codes and the Polar Complex
Hyperplane codes are a class of convex codes that arise as the output of a
one layer feed-forward neural network. Here we establish several natural
properties of stable hyperplane codes in terms of the {\it polar complex} of
the code, a simplicial complex associated to any combinatorial code. We prove
that the polar complex of a stable hyperplane code is shellable and show that
most currently known properties of the hyperplane codes follow from the
shellability of the appropriate polar complex.
