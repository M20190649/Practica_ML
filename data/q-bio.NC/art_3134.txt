The Creative Process of Cultural Evolution
Even this saying itself is a variant of a similar statement attributed to
Bernard of Chartres in the 12th Century, and inspired the title for a book by
Steven Hawking and an album by Oasis. Creative ideas beget other creative ideas
and, as a result, modifications accumulate, and we see an overall increase in
the complexity of cultural novelty over time, a phenomenon sometimes referred
to as the ratchet effect (Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). Although we may
never meet the people or objects that creatively influence us, by assimilating
what we encounter around us and bringing to bear our own insights and
perspectives, we all contribute in our own way, however small, to a second
evolutionary process -- the evolution of culture. This chapter explores how we
can better understand culture by understanding the creative processes that fuel
it, and better understand creativity by examining it from its cultural context.
First, we look at some theoretical frameworks for how culture evolves and what
these frameworks imply for the role of creativity. Then we will see how
questions about the relationship between creativity and cultural evolution have
been addressed using an agent-based model. We will also discuss studies of how
creative outputs are influenced, in perhaps unexpected ways, by other ideas and
individuals, and how individual creative styles "peek through" cultural outputs
in different domains.
