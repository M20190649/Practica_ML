Integrated Information in the Spiking-Bursting Stochastic Model
This study presents a comprehensive analytic description in terms of the
empirical "whole minus sum" version of Integrated Information in comparison to
the "decoder based" version for the "spiking-bursting" discrete-time,
discrete-state stochastic model, which was recently introduced to describe a
specific type of dynamics in a neuron-astrocyte network. The "whole minus sum"
information may change sign, and an interpretation of this transition in terms
of "net synergy" is available in the literature. This motivates our particular
interest to the sign of the "whole minus sum" information in our analytical
consideration. The behavior of the "whole minus sum" and "decoder based"
information measures are found to bear a lot of similarity, showing their
mutual asymptotic convergence as time-uncorrelated activity is increased, with
the sign transition of the "whole minus sum" information associated to a rapid
growth in the "decoder based" information. The study aims at creating a
theoretical base for using the spiking-bursting model as a well understood
reference point for applying Integrated Information concepts to systems
exhibiting similar bursting behavior (in particular, to neuron-astrocyte
networks). The model can also be of interest as a new discrete-state test bench
for different formulations of Integrated Information.
