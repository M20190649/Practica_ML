Dynamics on Networks of Manifolds
We propose a precise definition of a continuous time dynamical system made up
of interacting open subsystems. The interconnections of subsystems are coded by
directed graphs. We prove that the appropriate maps of graphs called graph
fibrations give rise to maps of dynamical systems. Consequently surjective
graph fibrations give rise to invariant subsystems and injective graph
fibrations give rise to projections of dynamical systems.
