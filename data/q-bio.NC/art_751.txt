The Dynamics of Functional Brain Networks: Integrated Network States
  during Cognitive Function
Higher brain function relies upon the ability to flexibly integrate
information across specialized communities of brain regions, however it is
unclear how this mechanism manifests over time. In this study, we use
time-resolved network analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to
demonstrate that the human brain traverses between two functional states that
maximize either segregation into tight-knit communities or integration across
otherwise disparate neural regions. The integrated state enables faster and
more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and is associated with dilations
in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern
the transition between these alternative modes of brain function. Our data
confirm a direct link between cognitive performance and the dynamic
reorganization of the network structure of the brain.
