Practical Approximation Method for Firing Rate Models of Coupled Neural
  Networks with Correlated Inputs
Rapid experimental advances now enable simultaneous electrophysiological
recording of neural activity at single-cell resolution across large regions of
the nervous system. Models of this neural network activity will necessarily
increase in size and complexity, thus increasing the computational cost of
simulating them and the challenge of analyzing them. Here we present a novel
method to approximate the activity and firing statistics of a general firing
rate network model (of Wilson-Cowan type) subject to noisy correlated
background inputs. The method requires solving a system of transcendental
equations and is fast compared to Monte Carlo simulations of coupled stochastic
differential equations. We implement the method with several examples of
coupled neural networks and show that the results are quantitatively accurate
even with moderate coupling strengths and an appreciable amount of
heterogeneity in many parameters. This work should be useful for investigating
how various neural attributes qualitatively effect the spiking statistics of
coupled neural networks. Matlab code implementing the method is freely
available at GitHub (\url{http://github.com/chengly70/FiringRateModReduction}).
