Predicting and increasing subjective well-being: response function model
  and rhythmic movement therapy
Background. The objective of the present study was to apply the nonlinear
response function model of subjective well-being (RFSWB model) to evaluate the
outcome of rhythmic movement therapy (RMT) for increasing subjective well-being
and to analyze whether intervention-related changes in several psychological
variables were mechanisms underlying SWB increase in subjects participating in
RMT group. Methods. A total of 273 subjects (54 males and 219 females, mean age
was 37.3(SD=10.5) years) were selected at random in nonclinical population and
assessed with the appropriate surveys and questionnaires. The RMT program was
proposed to the 105 subjects (24 males, 81 females, and mean age 37.6(SD=11.7)
years) with very low, low and medium SWB level. Control group was included.
Findings. Results revealed that: a) substantial changes in SWB and underlying
psychological state were observed among the participants as a result of RMT
intervention; b) RFSWB model predicts the changes in SWB after RMT intervention
satisfactorily and can help to identify the reliable predictors of success.
