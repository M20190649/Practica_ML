Evidence that Threatening Situations Enhance Creativity
We tested the hypothesis that threatening situations enhance creativity. 60
participants viewed a series of photographs and rated them on level of threat.
They then wrote two short stories: one based on the photograph they rated as
most threatening, and the other based on the photograph they rated as least
threatening. The stories were rated for level of creativity. Paired samples
t-tests revealed that stories based on threatening pictures produced a higher
degree of creativity than those based on non-threatening pictures. Theoretical
frameworks consistent with these findings are discussed.
