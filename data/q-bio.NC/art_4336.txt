Comb models for transport along spiny dendrites
This chapter is a contribution in the "Handbook of Applications of Chaos
Theory" ed. by Prof. Christos H Skiadas. The chapter is organized as follows.
First we study the statistical properties of combs and explain how to reduce
the effect of teeth on the movement along the backbone as a waiting time
distribution between consecutive jumps. Second, we justify an employment of a
comb-like structure as a paradigm for further exploration of a spiny dendrite.
In particular, we show how a comb-like structure can sustain the phenomenon of
the anomalous diffusion, reaction-diffusion and L\'evy walks. Finally, we
illustrate how the same models can be also useful to deal with the mechanism of
ta translocation wave / translocation waves of CaMKII and its propagation
failure. We also present a brief introduction to the fractional
integro-differentiation in appendix at the end of the chapter.
