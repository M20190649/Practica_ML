The most probable neural circuit exhibits low-dimensional sustained
  activity
Cortical neurons whose activity is recorded in behavioral experiments has
been classified into several types such as stimulus-related neurons,
delay-period neurons, and reward-related neurons. Moreover, the population
activity of neurons during a reaching task can be described by dynamics in
low-dimensional space. These results suggest that the low-dimensional dynamics
of a few types of neurons emerge in the cerebral cortex that is trained to
perform a task. This study investigates a simple neural circuit emerges with a
few types of neurons. Assuming an infinite number of neurons in the circuit
with connection weights drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we model the
dynamics of neurons by using a kernel function. Given that the system is
infinitely large, almost all capable circuits approximate the most probable
circuit for the task. We simulate two delayed response tasks and a
motor-pattern generation task. The model network exhibits low-dimensional
dynamics in all tasks. Considering that the connection weights are drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, the most probable circuit is the circuit with the
smallest connection weight; that is, the simplest circuit with the simplest
dynamics. Finally, we relate the dynamics to algorithmic information theory.
