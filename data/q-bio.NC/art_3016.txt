Criticality or Supersymmetry Breaking ?
In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded
by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently found approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastics (STS) identifies this phase as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase),
i.e., the phase where the topological supersymmetry pertaining to all
stochastic dynamical systems is broken spontaneously by the condensation of the
noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here, we support this picture in the context
of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of neuron-like elements and find that the
dynamics in the N-phase is indeed featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov
exponents and dominated by (anti)instantonic processes of
(creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks, which can be viewed as
predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also construct the phase
diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey neuromorphic hardware
and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in the deterministic
limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the application of STS to
neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain can reside only in
the N-phase.
