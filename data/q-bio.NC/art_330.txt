Impact of intrinsic biophysical diversity on the activity of spiking
  neurons
We study the effect of intrinsic heterogeneity on the activity of a
population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. By rescaling the dynamical
equation, we derive mathematical relations between multiple neuronal parameters
and a fluctuating input noise. To this end, common input to heterogeneous
neurons is conceived as an identical noise with neuron-specific mean and
variance. As a consequence, the neuronal output rates can differ considerably,
and their relative spike timing becomes desynchronized. This theory can
quantitatively explain some recent experimental findings.
