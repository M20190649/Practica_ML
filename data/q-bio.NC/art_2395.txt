Quantum-like perception entanglement leads to advantageous collective
  decisions
Social animals have to make collective decisions on a daily basis. In most
instances, these decisions are taken by consensus, when the group does what the
majority of individuals want. Individuals have to base these decisions on the
information they perceive from their socioecological landscape. The perception
mechanisms they use can influence the cost of collective decisions. Here I show
that when group-living individuals perceive their environment concurrently for
the same decisions, a quantum-like perception entanglement process can confer
less costly collective decisions than when individuals collect their
information independently. This highlights a mechanism that can help explain
what may seem to be irrational group-living behavior and opens avenues to
develop empirical tests for quantum decision theory.
