Simultaneous optogenetic manipulation and calcium imaging in freely
  moving C. elegans
A fundamental goal of systems neuroscience is to probe the dynamics of neural
activity that drive behavior. Here we present an instrument to simultaneously
manipulate neural activity via Channelrhodopsin, monitor neural response via
GCaMP3, and observe behavior in freely moving C. elegans. We use the instrument
to directly observe the relation between sensory stimuli, interneuron activity
and locomotion in the mechanosensory circuit.
