Fractal Fluctuations in Human Walking: Comparison between Auditory and
  Visually Guided Stepping
In human locomotion, sensorimotor synchronization of gait consists of the
coordination of stepping with rhythmic auditory cues (auditory cueing, AC). AC
changes the long-range correlations among consecutive strides (fractal
dynamics) into anti-correlations. Visual cueing (VC) is the alignment of step
lengths with marks on the floor. The effects of VC on the fluctuation structure
of walking have not been investigated. Therefore, the objective was to compare
the effects of AC and VC on the fluctuation pattern of basic spatiotemporal
gait parameters. Thirty-six healthy individuals walked 3 x 500 strides on an
instrumented treadmill with augmented reality capabilities. The conditions were
no cueing (NC), AC, and VC. AC included an isochronous metronome. In VC,
projected stepping stones were synchronized with the treadmill speed. Detrended
fluctuation analysis assessed the correlation structure. The coefficient of
variation (CV) was also assessed. The results showed that AC and VC similarly
induced a strong anti-correlated pattern in the gait parameters. The CVs were
similar between the NC and AC conditions but substantially higher in the VC
condition. AC and VC probably mobilize similar motor control pathways and can
be used alternatively in gait rehabilitation. However, the increased gait
variability induced by VC should be considered.
