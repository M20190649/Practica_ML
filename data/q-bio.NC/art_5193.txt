An encoding framework with brain inner state for natural image
  identification
Neural encoding and decoding, which aim to characterize the relationship
between stimuli and brain activities, have emerged as an important area in
cognitive neuroscience. Traditional encoding models, which focus on feature
extraction and mapping, consider the brain as an input-output mapper without
inner states. In this work, inspired by the fact that human brain acts like a
state machine, we proposed a novel encoding framework that combines information
from both the external world and the inner state to predict brain activity. The
framework comprises two parts: forward encoding model that deals with visual
stimuli and inner state model that captures influence from intrinsic
connections in the brain. The forward model can be any traditional encoding
model, making the framework flexible. The inner state model is a linear model
to utilize information in the prediction residuals of the forward model. The
proposed encoding framework can achieve much better performance on natural
image identification from fMRI response than forwardonly models. The
identification accuracy will decrease slightly with the dataset size
increasing, but remain relatively stable with different identification methods.
The results confirm that the new encoding framework is effective and robust
when used for brain decoding.
