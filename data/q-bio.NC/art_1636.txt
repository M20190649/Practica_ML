An Upper Bound on the Number of Discrete States Possible for the Human
  Brain
Human brains are arguably the most complex entities known. Composed of
billions of neurons, connected via a highly detailed structure where the
underlying method by which functionality occurs is still debated. Here we
consider one theory for neural coding, synchronization coding, which gives rise
to the highest possible number of discrete states that a brain could exist in.
A strict upper bound on the number of these states is determined. We conclude
that the theoretical upper limit on the capacity of one human brain is almost
inconceivably large and massively larger than the corresponding theoretical
limit that could be obtained using every transistor ever built.
