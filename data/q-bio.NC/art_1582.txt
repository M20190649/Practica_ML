Hacking the Brain: Triggering Neuroplasticity for Enhancing Musical
  Talent: A study on Monkey and Human behavior after Exposure to Videogames and
  Visual/Auditory Stimuli to Increase Musical Abilities through Neuroplasticity
In this paper, we analyze the cognitive improvements that can be achieved
through hacking the brain through the use of multiple methods to enhance
neuroplasticity. Exposure to gaming, for example, has proven conducive for
learning real-world abilities through auditory and visual stimuli. We will
discuss cortical magnification and receptive field sizes, as well as
topographic brain maps in the context of neuroplasticity. We finally propose
more studies to be performed to improve musical talent and musical abilities.
