Time-resolved and spectral-resolved optical imaging to study brain
  hemodynamics in songbirds
Contrary to the intense debate about brain oxygen dynamics and its uncoupling
in mammals, very little is known in birds. In zebra finches, picosecond optical
tomography (POT) with a white laser and a streak camera can measure in vivo
oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) concentration changes following
physiological stimulation (familiar calls and songs). POT demonstrated
sufficient sub-micromolar sensitivity to resolve the fast changes in
hippocampus and auditory forebrain areas with 250 \mu m resolution. The
time-course is composed of (i) an early 2s-long event with a significant
decrease in Hb and HbO2, respectively -0.7 \mu Moles/L and -0.9 \mu Moles/L
(ii) a subsequent increase in blood oxygen availability with a plateau of HbO2
(+0.3 \mu Moles/L) and (iii) pronounced vasodilatation events immediately
following the end of the stimulus. One of the findings of our work is the
direct link between the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals previously
published in birds and our results. Furthermore, the early vasoconstriction
event and post-stimulus ringing seem to be more pronounced in birds than in
mammals. These results in bird, a tachymetabolic vertebrate with a long
lifespan, can potentially yield new insights for example in brain aging.
