Adaptation of olfactory receptor abundances for efficient coding
Olfactory receptor usage is highly heterogeneous, with some receptor types
being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. We propose an explanation
for this striking fact: the receptor distribution is tuned to maximally
represent information about the olfactory environment in a regime of efficient
coding that is sensitive to the global context of correlated sensor responses.
This model predicts that in mammals, where olfactory sensory neurons are
replaced regularly, receptor abundances should continuously adapt to odor
statistics. Experimentally, increased exposure to odorants leads variously, but
reproducibly, to increased, decreased, or unchanged abundances of different
activated receptors. We demonstrate that this diversity of effects is required
for efficient coding when sensors are broadly correlated, and provide an
algorithm for predicting which olfactory receptors should increase or decrease
in abundance following specific environmental changes. Finally, we give simple
dynamical rules for neural birth and death processes that might underlie this
adaptation.
