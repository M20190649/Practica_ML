Rapid de novo shape encoding: a challenge to connectionist modeling
Neural network (connectionist) models are designed to encode image features
and provide the building blocks for object and shape recognition. These models
generally call for: a) initial diffuse connections from one neuron population
to another, and b) training to bring about a functional change in those
connections so that one or more high-tier neurons will selectively respond to a
specific shape stimulus. Advanced models provide for translation, size, and
rotation invariance. The present discourse notes that recent work on human
perceptual skills has demonstrated immediate encoding of unknown shapes that
were seen only once. Further, the perceptual mechanism provided for
translation, size, and rotation invariance. This finding represents a challenge
to connectionist models that require many training trials to achieve
recognition and invariance.
