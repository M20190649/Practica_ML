Analytical modelling of temperature effects on synapses
It was previously reported, that temperature may significantly influence
neural dynamics on different levels of brain modelling. Due to this fact, while
creating the model in computational neuroscience we would like to make it
scalable for wide-range of various brain temperatures. However currently,
because of a lack of experimental data and an absence of analytical model
describing temperature influence on synapses, it is not possible to include
temperature effects on multi-neuron modelling level. In this paper, we propose
first step to deal with this problem: new analytical model of AMPA-type
synaptic conductance, which is able to include temperature effects in
low-frequency stimulations. It was constructed on basis of Markov model
description of AMPA receptor kinetics and few simplifications motivated both
experimentally and from Monte Carlo simulation of synaptic transmission. The
model may be used for efficient and accurate implementation of temperature
effects on AMPA receptor conductance in large scale neural network simulations.
This in fact, opens wide-range of new possibilities for researching an
influence of temperature on brain functioning.
