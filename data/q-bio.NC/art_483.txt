Consciousness and Learning based on DNA Recombination and Memristor
  Quality of Microtubules
This paper is a completion of an earlier model proposed by us. In the model
different memories are attached at cell surface determinants which are the
result of DNA recombination. Our earlier experiments strongly suggest that DNA
recombination actually takes place during a short period of early development
in the brain in a limited number of neurons. In the present paper a model is
presented in which switchboard neurons play a key role in the storage and
retrieving of memory. And as a consequence, they play a major role in the
process of learning and form the basic material for consciousness. In the
original model there was insufficient explanation for the realization of the
internal connection of one cell surface determinant to the other. We realized
that tubulin should play a role in these intracellular connections. The tubulin
molecules can form a connective wire because of a change of shape of the
individual tubulin dimers. This way the fast switch is realized by the switch
of the tubulin dimer configuration. Because the cell should remember which
switch was activated and which one was not or less activated, we postulate the
memristor quality of microtubules.
