The Recognizability of Individual Creative Styles Within and Across
  Domains
We present a set of studies that tested the hypothesis that creative style is
recognizable within and across domains. Art students were shown two sets of
paintings, the first by five famous artists and the second by their art student
peers. For both sets, they guessed the creators of the works at above-chance
levels. In a similar study, creative writing students guessed at above-chance
levels which passages were written by which of five famous writers, and which
passages were written by which of their writing student peers. When creative
writing students were asked to produce works of art, they guessed at
above-chance levels which of their peers produced which artwork. Finally, art
students who were familiar with each other's paintings guessed at above-chance
levels which of their peers produced which non-painting artwork. The findings
support the hypothesis that creative styles are recognizable not just within
but also across domains. We suggest this is because all of an individual's
creative outputs are expressions of a particular underlying uniquely structured
self-organizing internal model of the world.
