Gender differences in time perception and its relation with academic
  performance: non-linear dynamics in the formation of cognitive systems
Non-linear dynamics is probably much more common in the epigenetic dynamics
of living beings than hitherto recognized. Here we report a case of global
bifurcation triggered by gender that affects higher cognitive functions in
humans. We report a cross-cultural study showing deviations in time perception,
as assessed by estimating the duration of brief sounds, according to their
durations and to the gender of the perciver. Results show that the duration of
sounds lasting less than 10 s were on average overestimated, whereas those
lasting longer were underestimated; estimates of sounds shorter than 1 s were
extremely inaccurate. Females consistently gave longer estimates than males.
Accuracy in time estimation was correlated to academic performance in
disciplines requiring mathematical or scientific skills in male, but not in
female students. This difference in correlation however had nothing to do with
overall skills in mathematics. Both sexes scored similarly in scientific and
technical disciplines, but females had higher grades than males in languages
and lower ones in physical education. Our results confirm existing evidence for
gender differences in cognitive processing, hinting to the existence of
different "mathematical intelligences" with different non-linear relationships
between natural or biological mathematical intuition and time perception.
