Characterizing functional brain networks and emotional centers based on
  Rasa theory of Indian aesthetics
In Indian history of arts, Rasas are the aesthetics associated with any
auditory, visual, literary or musical piece of art that evokes highly
orchestrated emotional states. In this work, we study the functional response
of the brain to movie clippings meant to evoke the Rasas through network
analysis. We extract functional brain networks using coherence measures on EEG
recordings of film clips from popular Indian Bollywood movies representing nine
Rasas in the Indian Natyasastra. Structural and functional network measures
were computed for these brain networks, averaging over a range of significant
edge weights, in different brainwave frequency bands. We identify segregation
of neuronal wiring in the brain into modules using a community detection
algorithm. Further, using mutual information measure, we compare and contrast
the modular organizations of brain network corresponding to different Rasas.
Hubs identified using centrality measure reveal the network nodes that are
central to information propagation across all Rasas. We also observe that the
functional connectivity is suppressed when high-frequency waves such as beta
and gamma are dominant in the brain. The significant links causing differences
between the Rasa pairs are extracted statistically.
