Bayesian Inference with Spiking Neurons
Humans and other animals behave as if we perform fast Bayesian inference
underlying decisions and movement control given uncertain sense data. Here we
show that a biophysically realistic model of the subthreshold membrane
potential of a single neuron can exactly compute the numerator in Bayes rule
for inferring the Poisson parameter of a sensory spike train. A simple network
of spiking neurons can construct and represent the Bayesian posterior density
of a parameter of an external cause that affects the Poisson parameter,
accurately and in real time.
