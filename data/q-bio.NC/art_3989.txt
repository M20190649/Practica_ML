Can intrinsic noise induce various resonant peaks?
We theoretically describe how weak signals may be efficiently transmitted
throughout more than one frequency range in noisy excitable media by kind of
stochastic multiresonance. This serves us here to reinterpret recent
experiments in neuroscience, and to suggest that many other systems in nature
might be able to exhibit several resonances. In fact, the observed behavior
happens in our (network) model as a result of competition between (1) changes
in the transmitted signals as if the units were varying their activation
threshold, and (2) adaptive noise realized in the model as rapid
activity-dependent fluctuations of the connection intensities. These two
conditions are indeed known to characterize heterogeneously networked systems
of excitable units, e.g., sets of neurons and synapses in the brain. Our
results may find application also in the design of detector devices.
