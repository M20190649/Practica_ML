Recurrent Interactions in Spiking Networks with Arbitrary Topology
The population activity of random networks of excitatory and inhibitory leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons has been studied extensively. In particular, a
state of asynchronous activity with low firing rates and low pairwise
correlations emerges in sparsely connected networks. We apply linear response
theory to evaluate the influence of detailed network structure on neuron
dynamics. It turns out that pairwise correlations induced by direct and
indirect network connections can be related to the matrix of direct linear
interactions. Furthermore, we study the influence of characteristics of the
neuron model. Interpreting the reset as self-inhibition we examine its
influence, via the spectrum of single neuron activity, on network
autocorrelation functions and the overall correlation level. The neuron model
also affects the form of interaction kernels and consequently the
time-dependent correlation functions. We finally find that a linear instability
of networks with Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi topology coincides with a global
transition to a highly correlated network state. Our work shows that recurrent
interactions have a profound impact on spike train statistics and provides
tools to study effects of specific network topologies.
