Predicting single-neuron activity in locally connected networks
The characterization of coordinated activity in neuronal populations has
received renewed interest in the light of advancing experimental techniques
which allow recordings from multiple units simultaneously. Across both in vitro
and in vivo preparations, nearby neurons show coordinated responses when
spontaneously active, and when subject to external stimuli. Recent work
(Truccolo, Hochberg, & Donoghue, 2010) has connected these coordinated
responses to behavior, showing that small ensembles of neurons in arm related
areas of sensorimotor cortex can reliably predict single-neuron spikes in
behaving monkeys and humans. We investigate this phenomenon utilizing an
analogous point process model, showing that in the case of a computational
model of cortex responding to random background inputs, one is similarly able
to predict the future state of a single neuron by considering its own spiking
history, together with the spiking histories of randomly sampled ensembles of
nearby neurons. This model exhibits realistic cortical architecture and
displays bursting episodes in the two distinct connectivity schemes studied. We
conjecture that the baseline predictability we find in these instances is
characteristic of locally connected networks more broadly considered.
