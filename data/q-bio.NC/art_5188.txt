Playing magic tricks to deep neural networks untangles human deception
Magic is the art of producing in the spectator an illusion of impossibility.
Although the scientific study of magic is in its infancy, the advent of recent
tracking algorithms based on deep learning allow now to quantify the skills of
the magician in naturalistic conditions at unprecedented resolution and
robustness. In this study, we deconstructed stage magic into purely motor
maneuvers and trained an artificial neural network (DeepLabCut) to follow coins
as a professional magician made them appear and disappear in a series of
tricks. Rather than using AI as a mere tracking tool, we conceived it as an
"artificial spectator". When the coins were not visible, the algorithm was
trained to infer their location as a human spectator would (i.e. in the left
fist). This created situations where the human was fooled while AI (as seen by
a human) was not, and vice versa. Magic from the perspective of the machine
reveals our own cognitive biases.
