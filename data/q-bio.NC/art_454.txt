Sequential dependencies between trials in free choice tasks
In two previous experiments we investigated the neural precursors of
subjects' "free" choices for one of two options (pressing one of two buttons,
and choosing between adding and subtracting numbers). In these experiments the
distribution of sequence lengths was taken as an approximate indicator of the
randomness (or lack of sequential dependency) of the choice sequences. However,
this method is limited in its ability to reveal sequential dependencies. Here
we present a more detailed individual-subject analysis and conclude that
despite of the presence of significant sequential dependencies the subjects'
behavior still approximates randomness, as measured by an entropy rate (on
pooled data) of 0.940 bit / trial and 0.965 bit / trial in the two experiments.
We also provide the raw single-subject behavioral data.
