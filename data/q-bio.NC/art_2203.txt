Depressive patients are more impulsive and inconsistent in intertemporal
  choice behavior for monetary gain and loss than healthy subjects- an analysis
  based on Tsallis' statistics
Depression has been associated with impaired neural processing of reward and
punishment. However, to date, little is known regarding the relationship
between depression and intertemporal choice for gain and loss. We compared
impulsivity and inconsistency in intertemporal choice for monetary gain and
loss (quantified with parameters in the q-exponential discount function based
on Tsallis' statistics) between depressive patients and healthy control
subjects. This examination is potentially important for advances in
neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice, because depression is associated with
reduced serotonergic activities in the brain. We observed that depressive
patients were more impulsive and time-inconsistent in intertemporal choice
action for gain and loss, in comparison to healthy controls. The usefulness of
the q-exponential discount function for assessing the impaired decision-making
by depressive patients was demonstrated. Furthermore, biophysical mechanisms
underlying the altered intertemporal choice by depressive patients are
discussed in relation to impaired serotonergic neural systems.
