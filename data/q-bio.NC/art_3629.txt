Rapid online learning and robust recall in a neuromorphic olfactory
  circuit
The mammalian olfactory system learns new odors rapidly, exhibits negligible
interference among odor memories, and identifies known odors under challenging
conditions. The mechanisms by which it does so are unknown. We here present a
general theory for odor learning and identification under noise in the
olfactory system, and demonstrate its efficacy using a neuromorphic model of
the olfactory bulb. As with biological olfaction, the spike timing-based
algorithm utilizes distributed, event-driven computations and rapid online
learning. Localized spike timing-dependent plasticity rules are employed
iteratively over sequential gamma-frequency packets to construct odor
representations from the activity of chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind
tunnel. Learned odors then are reliably identified despite strong destructive
interference. Noise resistance is enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual
priming. Lifelong learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The
algorithm is applicable to any signal identification problem in which
high-dimensional signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.
