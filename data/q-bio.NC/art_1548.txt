The Making of a Creative Worldview
Research at the interface between cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and the
science of complex, dynamical systems, is piecing together an understanding of
the creative process, including how it works, how it can be fostered, and the
developmental antecedents and personality traits of particularly creative
people. This chapter examines the workings of creative minds, those with the
potential to significantly impact the evolution of human culture.
