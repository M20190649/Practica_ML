Navigable maps of structural brain networks across species
Brains are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been shaped by
physical and biochemical constraints throughout evolution. While these networks
provide global connectivity and sustain the broad spectrum of the functions of
the brain, the underlying routing strategies for communication between the
different areas and their control remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigate
the flow of information in connectomes of several species using greedy routing
as a distributed navigation protocol. In Euclidean space, in which brains have
evolved, our results unveil that the navigability of brains vary highly across
species. On the one hand, this result may suggest that the more evolved an
organism is, the more the structure of the connectome is encoded in the spatial
organization of the brain. On the other hand, conclusions obtained using
coarse-grained connectomes, where nodes correspond to areas instead of
individual neurones, may not apply to connectomes obtained at the microscopic,
neuronal level. Moreover, we prove that the effective geometry of the brain is
better described as hyperbolic rather than Euclidean. This indicates that other
factors besides degrees and Euclidean distance play a significant role in the
existence of connections. On a more practical perspective, hyperbolic
embeddings offer a universal and meaningful representations to compare brain
networks across species on an equal footing.
