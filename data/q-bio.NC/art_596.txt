Task-driven intra- and interarea communications in primate cerebral
  cortex
Neural correlations during a cognitive task are central to study brain
information processing and computation. However, they have been poorly analyzed
due to the difficulty of recording simultaneous single neurons during task
performance. In the present work, we quantified neural directional correlations
using spike trains that were simultaneously recorded in sensory, premotor, and
motor cortical areas of two monkeys during a somatosensory discrimination task.
Upon modeling spike trains as binary time series, we used a nonparametric
Bayesian method to estimate pairwise directional correlations between many
pairs of neurons throughout different stages of the task, namely, perception,
working memory, decision making, and motor report. We find that solving the
task involves feedforward and feedback correlation paths linking sensory and
motor areas during certain task intervals. Specifically, information is
communicated by task-driven neural correlations that are significantly delayed
across secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor, and motor areas when decision
making takes place. Crucially, when sensory comparison is no longer requested
for task performance, a major proportion of directional correlations
consistently vanish across all cortical areas.
