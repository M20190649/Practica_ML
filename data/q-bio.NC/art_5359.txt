Multitaper Spectral Analysis of Neuronal Spiking Activity Driven by
  Latent Stationary Processes
Investigating the spectral properties of the neural covariates that underlie
spiking activity is an important problem in systems neuroscience, as it allows
to study the role of brain rhythms in cognitive functions. While the spectral
estimation of continuous time-series is a well-established domain, computing
the spectral representation of these neural covariates from spiking data sets
forth various challenges due to the intrinsic non-linearities involved. In this
paper, we address this problem by proposing a variant of the multitaper method
specifically tailored for point process data. To this end, we construct
auxiliary spiking statistics from which the eigen-spectra of the underlying
latent process can be directly inferred using maximum likelihood estimation,
and thereby the multitaper estimate can be efficiently computed. Comparison of
our proposed technique to existing methods using simulated data reveals
significant gains in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.
