Six networks on a universal neuromorphic computing substrate
In this study, we present a highly configurable neuromorphic computing
substrate and use it for emulating several types of neural networks. At the
heart of this system lies a mixed-signal chip, with analog implementations of
neurons and synapses and digital transmission of action potentials. Major
advantages of this emulation device, which has been explicitly designed as a
universal neural network emulator, are its inherent parallelism and high
acceleration factor compared to conventional computers. Its configurability
allows the realization of almost arbitrary network topologies and the use of
widely varied neuronal and synaptic parameters. Fixed-pattern noise inherent to
analog circuitry is reduced by calibration routines. An integrated development
environment allows neuroscientists to operate the device without any prior
knowledge of neuromorphic circuit design. As a showcase for the capabilities of
the system, we describe the successful emulation of six different neural
networks which cover a broad spectrum of both structure and functionality.
