Chaotic and non-chaotic phases in experimental responses of a single
  neuron
Consistency and predictability of brain functionalities depend on
reproducible activity of a single neuron. We identify a reproducible
non-chaotic neuronal phase where deviations between concave response latency
profiles of a single neuron do not increase with the number of stimulations. A
chaotic neuronal phase emerges at a transition to convex latency profiles which
diverge exponentially, indicating irreproducible response timings. Our findings
are supported by a quantitative mathematical framework and found robust to
periodic and random stimulation patterns. In addition, these results put a
bound on the neuronal temporal resolution which can be enhanced below a
millisecond using neuronal chains.
