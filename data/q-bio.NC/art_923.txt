Static and dynamic measures of human brain connectivity predict
  complementary aspects of human cognitive performance
In cognitive network neuroscience, the connectivity and community structure
of the brain network is related to cognition. Much of this research has focused
on two measures of connectivity - modularity and flexibility - which frequently
have been examined in isolation. By using resting state fMRI data from 52 young
adults, we investigate the relationship between modularity, flexibility and
performance on cognitive tasks. We show that flexibility and modularity are
highly negatively correlated. However, we also demonstrate that flexibility and
modularity make unique contributions to explain task performance, with
modularity predicting performance for simple tasks and flexibility predicting
performance on complex tasks that require cognitive control and executive
functioning. The theory and results presented here allow for stronger links
between measures of brain network connectivity and cognitive processes.
