Role of calcium and noise in the persistent activity of an isolated
  neuron
The activity of an isolated and auto-connected neuron is studied using
Hodgkin--Huxley and Integrate-and-Fire frameworks. Main ingredients of the
modeling are the auto-stimulating autaptic current observed in experiments,
with a spontaneous synaptic liberation noise and a calcium--dependent negative
feedback mechanism. The distributions of inter-spikes intervals and burst
durations are analytically calculated, and show a good agreement with
experimental data.
