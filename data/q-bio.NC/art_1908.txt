Dissipation and spontaneous symmetry breaking in brain dynamics
We compare the predictions of the dissipative quantum model of brain with
neurophysiological data collected from electroencephalograms resulting from
high-density arrays fixed on the surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas
of trained rabbits and cats. Functional brain imaging in relation to behavior
reveals the formation of coherent domains of synchronized neuronal oscillatory
activity and phase transitions predicted by the dissipative model.
