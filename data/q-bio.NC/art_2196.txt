Towards a Probabilistic Definition of Seizures
This writing: a) Draws attention to the intricacies inherent to the pursuit
of a universal seizure definition even when powerful, well understood signal
analysis methods are utilized to this end; b) Identifies this aim as a
multi-objective optimization problem and discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of adopting or rejecting a unitary seizure definition; c)
Introduces a Probabilistic Measure of Seizure Activity to manage this thorny
issue. The challenges posed by the attempt to define seizures unitarily may be
partly related to their fractal properties and understood through a simplistic
analogy to the so-called "Richardson effect". A revision of the time-honored
conceptualization of seizures may be warranted to further advance epileptology.
