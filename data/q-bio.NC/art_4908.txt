Spike Sorting by Convolutional Dictionary Learning
Spike sorting refers to the problem of assigning action potentials observed
in extra-cellular recordings of neural activity to the neuron(s) from which
they originate. We cast this problem as one of learning a convolutional
dictionary from raw multi-electrode waveform data, subject to sparsity
constraints. In this context, sparsity refers to the number of neurons that are
allowed to spike simultaneously. The convolutional dictionary setting, along
with its assumptions (e.g. refractoriness) that are motivated by the
spike-sorting problem, let us give theoretical bounds on the sample complexity
of spike sorting as a function of the number of underlying neurons, the rate of
occurrence of simultaneous spiking, and the firing rate of the neurons. We
derive memory/computation-efficient convolutional versions of OMP (cOMP) and
KSVD (cKSVD), popular algorithms for sparse coding and dictionary learning
respectively. We demonstrate via simulations that an algorithm that alternates
between cOMP and cKSVD can recover the underlying spike waveforms successfully,
assuming few neurons spike simultaneously, and is stable in the presence of
noise. We also apply the algorithm to extra-cellular recordings from a tetrode
in the rat Hippocampus.
