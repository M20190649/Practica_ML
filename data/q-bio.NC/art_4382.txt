Activation process in excitable systems with multiple noise sources:
  Large number of units
We study the activation process in large assemblies of type II excitable
units whose dynamics is influenced by two independent noise terms. The
mean-field approach is applied to explicitly demonstrate that the assembly of
excitable units can itself exhibit macroscopic excitable behavior. In order to
facilitate the comparison between the excitable dynamics of a single unit and
an assembly, we introduce three distinct formulations of the assembly
activation event. Each formulation treats different aspects of the relevant
phenomena, including the threshold-like behavior and the role of coherence of
individual spikes. Statistical properties of the assembly activation process,
such as the mean time-to-first pulse and the associated coefficient of
variation, are found to be qualitatively analogous for all three formulations,
as well as to resemble the results for a single unit. These analogies are shown
to derive from the fact that global variables undergo a stochastic bifurcation
from the stochastically stable fixed point to continuous oscillations. Local
activation processes are analyzed in the light of the competition between the
noise-led and the relaxation-driven dynamics. We also briefly report on a
system-size anti-resonant effect displayed by the mean time-to-first pulse.
