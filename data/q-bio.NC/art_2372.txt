Synchrony suppression in ensembles of coupled oscillators via adaptive
  vanishing feedback
Synchronization and emergence of a collective mode is a general phenomenon,
frequently observed in ensembles of coupled self-sustained oscillators of
various natures. In several circumstances, in particular in cases of
neurological pathologies, this state of the active medium is undesirable.
Destruction of this state by a specially designed stimulation is a challenge of
high clinical relevance. Typically, the precise effect of an external action on
the ensemble is unknown, since the microscopic description of the oscillators
and their interactions are not available. We show, that desynchronization in
case of a large degree of uncertainty about important features of the system is
nevertheless possible; it can by achieved by virtue of a feedback loop with an
additional adaptation of parameters. The adaptation also ensures
desynchronization of ensembles with non-stationary, time-varying parameters. We
perform the stability analysis of the feedback-controlled system and
demonstrate efficient destruction of synchrony for several models, including
those of spiking and bursting neurons.
