Correlation-based model of artificially induced plasticity in motor
  cortex by a bidirectional brain-computer interface
Experiments show that spike-triggered stimulation performed with
Bidirectional Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BBCI) can artificially strengthen
connections between separate neural sites in motor cortex (MC). What are the
neuronal mechanisms responsible for these changes and how does targeted
stimulation by a BBCI shape population-level synaptic connectivity? The present
work describes a recurrent neural network model with probabilistic spiking
mechanisms and plastic synapses capable of capturing both neural and synaptic
activity statistics relevant to BBCI conditioning protocols. When spikes from a
neuron recorded at one MC site trigger stimuli at a second target site after a
fixed delay, the connections between sites are strengthened for spike-stimulus
delays consistent with experimentally derived spike time dependent plasticity
(STDP) rules. However, the relationship between STDP mechanisms at the level of
networks, and their modification with neural implants remains poorly
understood. Using our model, we successfully reproduces key experimental
results and use analytical derivations, along with novel experimental data. We
then derive optimal operational regimes for BBCIs, and formulate predictions
concerning the efficacy of spike-triggered stimulation in different regimes of
cortical activity.
