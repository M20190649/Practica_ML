Limit-cycle-based control of the myogenic wingbeat rhythm in the fruit
  fly Drosophila
In many animals, rhythmic motor activity is governed by neural limit cycle
oscillations under the control of sensory feedback. In the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster, the wingbeat rhythm is generated myogenically by
stretch-activated muscles and hence independently from direct neural input. In
this study, we explored if generation and cycle-by-cycle control of
Drosophila's wingbeat are functionally separated, or if the steering muscles
instead couple into the myogenic rhythm as a weak forcing of a limit cycle
oscillator. We behaviourally tested tethered flying flies for characteristic
properties of limit cycle oscillators. To this end, we mechanically stimulated
the fly's gyroscopic organs, the halteres, and determined the phase
relationship between the wing motion and stimulus. The flies synchronized with
the stimulus for specific ranges of stimulus amplitude and frequency, revealing
the characteristic Arnold tongues of a forced limit cycle oscillator. Rapid
periodic modulation of the wingbeat frequency prior to locking demonstrates the
involvement of the fast steering muscles in the observed control of the
wingbeat frequency. We propose that the mechanical forcing of a myogenic limit
cycle oscillator permits flies to avoid the comparatively slow control based on
a neural central pattern generator.
