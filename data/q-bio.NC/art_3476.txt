Temporal Stable Community in Time-Varying Networks
Identifying community structure of a complex network provides insight to the
interdependence between the network topology and emergent collective behaviors
of networks, while detecting such invariant communities in a time-varying
network is more challenging. In this paper, we define the temporal stable
community and newly propose the concept of dynamic modularity to evaluate the
stable community structures in time-varying networks, which is robust against
small changes as verified by several empirical time-varying network datasets.
Besides, using the volatility features of temporal stable communities in
functional brain networks, we successfully differentiate the ADHD (Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients and healthy controls efficiently.
