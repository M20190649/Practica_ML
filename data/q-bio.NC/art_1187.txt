Spatial statistics for gaze patterns in scene viewing: Effects of
  repeated viewing
Scene viewing is used to study attentional selection in complex but still
controlled environments. One of the main observations on eye movements during
scene viewing is the inhomogeneous distribution of fixation locations: While
some parts of an image are fixated by almost all observers and are inspected
repeatedly by the same observer, other image parts remain unfixated by
observers even after long exploration intervals. Here, we apply spatial point
process methods to investigate the relationship between pairs of fixations.
More precisely, we use the pair correlation function (PCF), a powerful
statistical tool, to evaluate dependencies between fixation locations along
individual scanpaths. We demonstrate that aggregation of fixation locations
within four degrees is stronger than expected from chance. Furthermore, the PCF
reveals stronger aggregation of fixations when the same image is presented a
second time. We use simulations of a dynamical model to show that a narrower
spatial attentional span may explain differences in pair correlations between
the first and the second inspection of the same image.
