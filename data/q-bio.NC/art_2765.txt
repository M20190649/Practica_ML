Model of the Songbird Nucleus HVC as a Network of Central Pattern
  Generators
We propose a functional architecture of the adult songbird nucleus HVC in
which the core element is a "functional syllable unit" (FSU). In this model,
HVC is organized into FSUs, each of which provides the basis for the production
of one syllable in vocalization. Within each FSU, the inhibitory neuron
population takes one of two operational states: (A) simultaneous firing wherein
all inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously, and (B) competitive firing of the
inhibitory neurons. Switching between these basic modes of activity is
accomplished via changes in the synaptic strengths among the inhibitory
neurons. The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such
that during state (A) the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while
during state (B) patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur.
The latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the
inhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by
the manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other.
  Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We
illustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics
of the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that
are currently testable experimentally. In addition, and standing apart from the
core features of an FSU, we propose that the transition between modes may be
governed by the biophysical mechanism of neuromodulation.
