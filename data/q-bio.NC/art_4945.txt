Sequential Detection of Regime Changes in Neural Data
The problem of detecting changes in firing patterns in neural data is
studied. The problem is formulated as a quickest change detection problem.
Important algorithms from the literature are reviewed. A new algorithmic
technique is discussed to detect deviations from learned baseline behavior. The
algorithms studied can be applied to both spike and local field potential data.
The algorithms are applied to mice spike data to verify the presence of
behavioral learning.
