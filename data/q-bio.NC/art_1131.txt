An EEG study of creativity in expert classical musicians
Previous research has shown positive correlations between EEG alpha activity
and performing creative tasks. In this study, expert classical musicians (n=4)
were asked to play their instrument while being monitored with a wireless EEG
headset. Data was collected during two rehearsal types: (a) in their regular,
fixed ensemble;; (b) in an improvised, mixed ensemble with unfamiliar musicians
and less rehearsal time. A positive correlation was found between alpha power
and the improvised setup (p<0.01, d=0.4). A positive correlation was also found
between alpha power and more intense play (p<0.01, d=0.2). There was a negative
correlation between alpha power and arousal due to stress, e.g., frowning after
playing a false note (p<0.01, d=0.6). Finally, the real-time capabilities of
wireless EEG monitoring were explored with a data visualisation during live
performance on stage.
