The Main Cognitive Model of Visual Recognition: Contour Recognition
In this paper, we will study the following pattern recognition problem: Every
pattern is a 3-dimensional graph, its surface can be split up into some
regions, every region is composed of the pixels with the approximately same
colour value and the approximately same depth value that is distance to eyes,
and there may also be some contours, e.g., literal contours, on a surface of
every pattern. For this problem we reveal the inherent laws. Moreover, we
establish a cognitive model to reflect the essential characteristics of the
recognition of this type of patterns. In [1], a coarser model or a basicer one
is described. In this paper, some important errors are revised, some key things
are added, at last, a complete model is described.
