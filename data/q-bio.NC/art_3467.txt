Quantum Theory Methods as a Possible Alternative for the Double-Blind
  Gold Standard of Evidence-Based Medicine: Outlining a New Research Program
We motivate the possibility of using notions and methods derived from quantum
physics, and more specifically from the research field known as 'quantum
cognition', to optimally model different situations in the field of medicine,
its decision-making processes and ensuing practices, particularly in relation
to chronic and rare diseases. This also as a way to devise alternative
approaches to the generally adopted double-blind gold standard.
