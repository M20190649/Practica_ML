Gaussian and exponential lateral connectivity on distributed spiking
  neural network simulation
We measured the impact of long-range exponentially decaying intra-areal
lateral connectivity on the scaling and memory occupation of a distributed
spiking neural network simulator compared to that of short-range Gaussian
decays. While previous studies adopted short-range connectivity, recent
experimental neurosciences studies are pointing out the role of longer-range
intra-areal connectivity with implications on neural simulation platforms.
Two-dimensional grids of cortical columns composed by up to 11 M point-like
spiking neurons with spike frequency adaption were connected by up to 30 G
synapses using short- and long-range connectivity models. The MPI processes
composing the distributed simulator were run on up to 1024 hardware cores,
hosted on a 64 nodes server platform. The hardware platform was a cluster of
IBM NX360 M5 16-core compute nodes, each one containing two Intel Xeon Haswell
8-core E5-2630 v3 processors, with a clock of 2.40 G Hz, interconnected through
an InfiniBand network, equipped with 4x QDR switches.
