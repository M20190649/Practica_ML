Coherence resonance in models of an excitable neuron with both fast and
  slow dynamics
We demonstrate the existence of noise-induced periodicity (coherence
resonance) in both a discrete-time model and a continuous-time model of an
excitable neuron. In particular, we show that the effects of noise added to the
fast and slow dynamics of the models are dramatically different. A
Fokker-Planck analysis gives a quantitative explanation of the effects.
