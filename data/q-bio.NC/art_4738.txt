Chimera states: Effects of different coupling topologies
Collective behavior among coupled dynamical units can emerge in various forms
as a result of different coupling topologies as well as different types of
coupling functions. Chimera states have recently received ample attention as a
fascinating manifestation of collective behavior, in particular describing a
symmetry breaking spatiotemporal pattern where synchronized and desynchronized
states coexist in a network of coupled oscillators. In this perspective, we
review the emergence of different chimera states, focusing on the effects of
different coupling topologies that describe the interaction network connecting
the oscillators. We cover chimera states that emerge in local, nonlocal and
global coupling topologies, as well as in modular, temporal and multilayer
networks. We also provide an outline of challenges and directions for future
research.
