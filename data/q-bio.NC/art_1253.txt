The differential geometry of perceptual similarity
Human similarity judgments are inconsistent with Euclidean, Hamming,
Mahalanobis, and the majority of measures used in the extensive literatures on
similarity and dissimilarity. From intrinsic properties of brain circuitry, we
derive principles of perceptual metrics, showing their conformance to
Riemannian geometry. As a demonstration of their utility, the perceptual
metrics are shown to outperform JPEG compression. Unlike machine-learning
approaches, the outperformance uses no statistics, and no learning. Beyond the
incidental application to compression, the metrics offer broad explanatory
accounts of empirical perceptual findings such as Tverskys triangle inequality
violations, contradictory human judgments of identical stimuli such as speech
sounds, and a broad range of other phenomena on percepts and concepts that may
initially appear unrelated. The findings constitute a set of fundamental
principles underlying perceptual similarity.
