A Music-generating System Inspired by the Science of Complex Adaptive
  Systems
This paper presents NetWorks (NW), an interactive music generation system
that uses a hierarchically clustered scale free network to generate music that
ranges from orderly to chaotic. NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of
creativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability
to self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something
akin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic
and associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns
that exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and
high levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.
The architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,
velocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes
are connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their
inputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data
that is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By
shifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and
associative processing modes.
