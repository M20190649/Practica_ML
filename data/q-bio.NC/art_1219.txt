Using Branch Predictors to Monitor Brain Activity
A key problem with neuroprostheses and brain monitoring interfaces is that
they need extreme energy efficiency. One way of lowering energy is to use the
low power modes avail- able on the processors embedded in these devices. We
present a technique to predict when neuronal activity of interest is likely to
occur, so that the processor can run at nominal operating frequency at those
times, and be placed in low power modes otherwise. To achieve this, we discover
that branch predictors can also predict brain activity. By performing brain
surgeries on awake and anesthetized mice, we evaluate several branch predictors
and find that perceptron branch predictors can predict cerebellar activity with
accuracies as high as 85%. Consequently, we co-opt branch predictors to dictate
when to transition between low power and normal operating modes, saving as much
as 59% of processor energy.
