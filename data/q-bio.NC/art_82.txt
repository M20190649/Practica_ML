Episodic synchronization in dynamically driven neurons
We examine the response of type II excitable neurons to trains of synaptic
pulses, as a function of the pulse frequency and amplitude. We show that the
resonant behavior characteristic of type II excitability, already described for
harmonic inputs, is also present for pulsed inputs. With this in mind, we study
the response of neurons to pulsed input trains whose frequency varies
continuously in time, and observe that the receiving neuron synchronizes
episodically to the input pulses, whenever the pulse frequency lies within the
neuron's locking range. We propose this behavior as a mechanism of rate-code
detection in neuronal populations. The results are obtained both in numerical
simulations of the Morris-Lecar model and in an electronic implementation of
the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, evidencing the robustness of the phenomenon.
