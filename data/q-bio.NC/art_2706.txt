Two distinct desynchronization processes caused by lesions in globally
  coupled neurons
To accomplish a task, the brain works like a synchronized neuronal network
where all the involved neurons work together. When a lesion spreads in the
brain, depending on its evolution, it can reach a significant portion of
relevant area. As a consequence, a phase transition might occur: the neurons
desynchronize and cannot perform a certain task anymore. Lesions are
responsible for either disrupting the neuronal connections or, in some cases,
for killing the neuron. In this work, we will use a simplified model of
neuronal network to show that these two types of lesions cause different types
of desynchronization.
