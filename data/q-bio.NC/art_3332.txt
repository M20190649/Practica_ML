Between perfectly critical and fully irregular: a reverberating model
  captures and predicts cortical spike propagation
Knowledge about the collective dynamics of cortical spiking is very
informative about the underlying coding principles. However, even most basic
properties are not known with certainty, because their assessment is hampered
by spatial subsampling, i.e. the limitation that only a tiny fraction of all
neurons can be recorded simultaneously with millisecond precision. Building on
a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we fit and carefully validate a
minimal model for cortical spike propagation. The model interpolates between
two prominent states: asynchronous and critical. We find neither of them in
cortical spike recordings across various species, but instead identify a narrow
reverberating regime. This approach enables us to predict yet unknown
properties from very short recordings and for every circuit individually,
including responses to minimal perturbations, intrinsic network timescales, and
the strength of external input compared to recurrent activation - thereby
informing about the underlying coding principles for each circuit, area, state
and task.
