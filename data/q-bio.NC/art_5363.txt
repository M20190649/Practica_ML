Information Flow Theory (IFT) of Biologic and Machine Consciousness:
  Implications for Artificial General Intelligence and the Technological
  Singularity
The subjective experience of consciousness is at once familiar and yet deeply
mysterious. Strategies exploring the top-down mechanisms of conscious thought
within the human brain have been unable to produce a generalized explanatory
theory that scales through evolution and can be applied to artificial systems.
Information Flow Theory (IFT) provides a novel framework for understanding both
the development and nature of consciousness in any system capable of processing
information. In prioritizing the direction of information flow over information
computation, IFT produces a range of unexpected predictions. The purpose of
this manuscript is to introduce the basic concepts of IFT and explore the
manifold implications regarding artificial intelligence, superhuman
consciousness, and our basic perception of reality.
