Modeling rhythmic patterns in the hippocampus
We investigate different dynamical regimes of neuronal network in the CA3
area of the hippocampus. The proposed neuronal circuit includes two fast- and
two slowly-spiking cells which are interconnected by means of dynamical
synapses. On the individual level, each neuron is modeled by FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations. Three basic rhythmic patterns are observed: gamma-rhythm in which
the fast neurons are uniformly spiking, theta-rhythm in which the individual
spikes are separated by quiet epochs, and theta/gamma rhythm with repeated
patches of spikes. We analyze the influence of asymmetry of synaptic strengths
on the synchronization in the network and demonstrate that strong asymmetry
reduces the variety of available dynamical states. The model network exhibits
multistability; this results in occurrence of hysteresis in dependence on the
conductances of individual connections. We show that switching between
different rhythmic patterns in the network depends on the degree of
synchronization between the slow cells.
