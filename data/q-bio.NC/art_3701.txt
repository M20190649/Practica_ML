Pitch Perception of Complex Sounds: Nonlinearity Revisited
The ability of the auditory system to perceive the fundamental frequency of a
sound even when this frequency is removed from the stimulus is an interesting
phenomenon related to the pitch of complex sounds. This capability is known as
``residue'' or ``virtual pitch'' perception and was first reported last century
in the pioneering work of Seebeck. It is residue perception that allows one to
listen to music with small transistor radios, which in general have a very poor
and sometimes negligible response to low frequencies. The first attempt, due to
Helmholtz, to explain the residue as a nonlinear effect in the ear considered
it to originate from difference combination tones. However, later experiments
have shown that the residue does not coincide with a difference combination
tone. These results and the fact that dichotically presented signals also
elicit residue perception have led to nonlinear theories being gradually
abandoned in favour of central processor models. In this paper we use recent
results from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to show that physical
frequencies produced by generic nonlinear oscillators acted upon by two
independent periodic excitations can reproduce with great precision most of the
experimental data about the residue without resorting to any kind of central
processing mechanism.
