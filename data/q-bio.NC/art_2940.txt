Solving the 2-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equation for Strongly Correlated
  Neurons
Pairs of neurons in brain networks often share much of the input they receive
from other neurons. Due to essential non-linearities of neuronal dynamics, the
consequences for the correlation of the output spike trains are not well
understood in the strongly correlated regime. Here we consider two leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons with correlated white noise input. We analyze this
scenario using a novel non-perturbative approach. Hence our treatment covers
both weakly and strongly correlated dynamics, generalizing previous results
based on linear response theory.
