Structural network heterogeneities and network dynamics: a possible
  dynamical mechanism for hippocampal memory reactivation
The hippocampus has the capacity for reactivating recently acquired memories
[1-3] and it is hypothesized that one of the functions of sleep reactivation is
the facilitation of consolidation of novel memory traces [4-11]. The dynamic
and network processes underlying such a reactivation remain, however, unknown.
We show that such a reactivation characterized by local, self-sustained
activity of a network region may be an inherent property of the recurrent
excitatory-inhibitory network with a heterogeneous structure. The entry into
the reactivation phase is mediated through a physiologically feasible
regulation of global excitability and external input sources, while the
reactivated component of the network is formed through induced network
heterogeneities during learning. We show that structural changes needed for
robust reactivation of a given network region are well within known
physiological parameters [12,13].
