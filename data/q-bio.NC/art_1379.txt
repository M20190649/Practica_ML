On the pros and cons of using temporal derivatives to assess brain
  functional connectivity
The study of correlations between brain regions is an important chapter of
the analysis of large-scale brain spatiotemporal dynamics. In particular, novel
methods suited to extract dynamic changes in mutual correlations are needed.
Here we scrutinize a recently reported metric dubbed "Multiplication of
Temporal Derivatives" (MTD) which is based on the temporal derivative of each
time series. The formal comparison of the MTD formula with the Pearson
correlation of the derivatives reveals only minor differences, which we find
negligible in practice. A comparison with the sliding window Pearson
correlation of the raw time series in several stationary and non-stationary
set-ups, including a realistic stationary network detection, reveals lower
sensitivity of derivatives to low frequency drifts and to autocorrelations but
also lower signal-to-noise ratio. It does not indicate any evident mathematical
advantages of the proposed metric over commonly used correlation methods.
