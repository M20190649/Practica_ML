cvBMS and cvBMA: filling in the gaps
With this technical report, we provide mathematical and implementational
details of cross-validated Bayesian model selection (cvBMS) and averaging
(cvBMA) that could not be communicated in the corresponding peer-reviewed
journal articles. This will allow statisticians and developers to comprehend
internal functionalities of cvBMS and cvBMA for further development of these
techniques.
