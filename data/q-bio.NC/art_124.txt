Thermal Impact on Spiking Properties in Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron with
  Synaptic Stimulus
The effect of environmental temperature on neuronal spiking behaviors is
investigated by numerically simulating the temperature dependence of spiking
threshold of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron subject to synaptic stimulus. We find
that the spiking threshold exhibits a global minimum in a "comfortable
temperature" range where spike initiation needs weakest synaptic strength,
indicating the occurrence of optimal use of synaptic transmission in neural
system. We further explore the biophysical origin of this phenomenon in ion
channel gating kinetics and also discuss its possible biological relevance in
information processing in neural systems.
