Tensor-Based Fusion of EEG and FMRI to Understand Neurological Changes
  in Schizophrenia
Neuroimaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and electroencephalography (EEG) provide information about neurological
functions in complementary spatiotemporal resolutions; therefore, fusion of
these modalities is expected to provide better understanding of brain activity.
In this paper, we jointly analyze fMRI and multi-channel EEG signals collected
during an auditory oddball task with the goal of capturing brain activity
patterns that differ between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.
Rather than selecting a single electrode or matricizing the third-order tensor
that can be naturally used to represent multi-channel EEG signals, we preserve
the multi-way structure of EEG data and use a coupled matrix and tensor
factorization (CMTF) model to jointly analyze fMRI and EEG signals. Our
analysis reveals that (i) joint analysis of EEG and fMRI using a CMTF model can
capture meaningful temporal and spatial signatures of patterns that behave
differently in patients and controls, and (ii) these differences and the
interpretability of the associated components increase by including multiple
electrodes from frontal, motor and parietal areas, but not necessarily by
including all electrodes in the analysis.
