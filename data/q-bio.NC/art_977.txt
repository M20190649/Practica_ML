Temporal Taylor's scaling of facial electromyography and electrodermal
  activity in the course of emotional stimulation
High frequency psychophysiological data create a challenge for quantitative
modeling based on Big Data tools since they reflect the complexity of processes
taking place in human body and its responses to external events. Here we
present studies of fluctuations in facial electromyography (fEMG) and
electrodermal activity (EDA) massive time series and changes of such signals in
the course of emotional stimulation. Zygomaticus major (ZYG, "smiling" muscle)
activity, corrugator supercilii (COR, "frowning"bmuscle) activity, and phasic
skin conductance (PHSC, sweating) levels of 65 participants were recorded
during experiments that involved exposure to emotional stimuli (i.e., IAPS
images, reading and writing messages on an artificial online discussion board).
Temporal Taylor's fluctuations scaling were found when signals for various
participants and during various types of emotional events were compared. Values
of scaling exponents were close to 1, suggesting an external origin of system
dynamics and/or strong interactions between system's basic elements (e.g.,
muscle fibres). Our statistical analysis shows that the scaling exponents
enable identification of high valence and arousal levels in ZYG and COR
signals.
