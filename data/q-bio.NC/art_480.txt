Bidirectional Control of Absence Seizures by the Basal Ganglia: A
  Computational Evidence
Absence epilepsy is believed to be associated with the abnormal interactions
between the cerebral cortex and thalamus. Besides the direct coupling,
anatomical evidence indicates that the cerebral cortex and thalamus also
communicate indirectly through an important intermediate bridge--basal ganglia.
It has been thus postulated that the basal ganglia might play key roles in the
modulation of absence seizures, but the relevant biophysical mechanisms are
still not completely established. Using a biophysically based model, we
demonstrate here that the typical absence seizure activities can be controlled
and modulated by the direct GABAergic projections from the substantia nigra
pars reticulata (SNr) to either the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) or the
specific relay nuclei (SRN) of thalamus, through different biophysical
mechanisms. Under certain conditions, these two types of seizure control are
observed to coexist in the same network. More importantly, due to the
competition between the inhibitory SNr-TRN and SNr-SRN pathways, we find that
both decreasing and increasing the activation of SNr neurons from the normal
level may considerably suppress the generation of SWDs in the coexistence
region. Overall, these results highlight the bidirectional functional roles of
basal ganglia in controlling and modulating absence seizures, and might provide
novel insights into the therapeutic treatments of this brain disorder.
