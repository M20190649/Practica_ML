On a Model of Quantum Mechanics and the Mind
In this paper I discuss Stapp's (2014) interesting proposal of using the
Quantum Zeno Effect to account for the mind/matter interaction. In particular,
I discuss some of the motivations for it, and then argue that, in his current
version, his model is circular (a solution to this, proposed by Kathryn Laskey,
is presented), insofar as the mind/matter problem is concerned. I also present
an alternative approach to some of the appealing aspects of using quantum
mechanics to think about consciousness.
