Quantifying time irreversibility using probabilistic differences between
  symmetric permutations
To simplify the quantification of time irreversibility, we employ order
patterns instead of the raw multi-dimension vectors in time series, and
considering the existence of forbidden permutation, we propose a
subtraction-based parameter, Ys, to measure the probabilistic differences
between symmetric permutations for time irreversibility. Two chaotic models,
the logistic and Henon systems, and reversible Gaussian process and their
surrogate data are used to validate the time-irreversible measure, and time
irreversibility of epileptic EEGs from Nanjing General Hospital is detected by
the parameter. Test results prove that it is promising to quantify time
irreversibility by measuring the subtraction-based probabilistic differences
between symmetric order patterns, and our findings highlight the manifestation
of nonlinearity of whether healthy or diseased EEGs and suggest that the
epilepsy leads to a decline in the nonlinearity of brain electrical activities
during seize-free intervals.
