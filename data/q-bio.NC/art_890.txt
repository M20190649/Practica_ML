Decline of long-range temporal correlations in the human brain during
  sustained wakefulness
Sleep is crucial for daytime functioning, cognitive performance and general
well-being. These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended
wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify.
Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is
characterized by long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in cortex, which are
supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks.
  Here we assess LRTCs in resting state human EEG data during a 40-hour sleep
deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the
scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from EEG amplitude
fluctuations. We find with both measures that LRTCs decline as sleep
deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in
signal power into appropriate consideration.
  Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain LRTCs in the
human brain. In complex networks, LRTCs naturally emerge in the vicinity of a
critical state. The observation of declining LRTCs during wake thus provides
additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks
towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.
