Distinguishing states of conscious arousal using statistical complexity
We apply techniques from the field of computational mechanics to evaluate the
statistical complexity of neural recording data in fruit flies. We connect
statistical complexity to the flies' level of conscious arousal, which is
manipulated by general anaesthesia (isoflurane). We show that the complexity of
even single channel time series data decreases under anaesthesia. The observed
difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal increases
as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account. In contrast
to prior work, our results show that complexity differences can emerge at very
short time scales and across broad regions of the fly brain without the need to
saturate Markov order, thus heralding the macroscopic state of anaesthesia in a
previously unforeseen manner. Furthering the links between physics, complexity
science and neuroscience promotes the understanding of the physical basis that
supports the level of conscious arousal in biological organisms.
