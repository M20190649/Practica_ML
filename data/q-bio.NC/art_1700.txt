Brain network organization as the computational architecture of
  cognition
Understanding neurocognitive computations will require not just localizing
cognitive information distributed throughout the brain but also determining how
that information got there. We review recent advances in linking (empirical and
simulated) brain network organization with cognitive information processing.
Building on these advances, we offer a new framework for understanding the role
of connectivity in cognition - network coding (encoding/decoding) models. These
models utilize connectivity to specify the transfer of information via neural
activity flow processes, successfully predicting the formation of cognitive
representations (e.g., face selectivity in the fusiform face area). The success
of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions
mechanistically emerge (are computed) from distributed activity flow processes
that are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.
