Fingerprinting Orientation Distribution Functions in Diffusion MRI
  detects smaller crossing angles
Diffusion tractography is routinely used to study white matter architecture
and brain connectivity in vivo. A key step for successful tractography of
neuronal tracts is the correct identification of tract directions in each
voxel. Here we propose a fingerprinting-based methodology to identify these
fiber directions in Orientation Distribution Functions, dubbed
ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP). In ODF-FP, fiber configurations are selected based
on the similarity between measured ODFs and elements in a pre-computed library.
In noisy ODFs, the library matching algorithm penalizes the more complex fiber
configurations. ODF simulations and analysis of bootstrapped partial and
whole-brain in vivo datasets show that the ODF-FP approach improves the
detection of fiber pairs with small crossing angles while maintaining fiber
direction precision, which leads to better tractography results. Rather than
focusing on the ODF maxima, the ODF-FP approach uses the whole ODF shape to
infer fiber directions to improve the detection of fiber bundles with small
crossing angle. The resulting fiber directions aid tractography algorithms in
accurately displaying neuronal tracts and calculating brain connectivity.
