Generalized Functions & Experimental Methods of Obtaining Statistical
  Variable-Quantities Which Fully Determine Preferences in Choice-Rich
  Environments
Preferences of individuals are distributions of elements generated by
generalized functions. Models of economic decision-making derived from such
distributions are consistent with results of physiological experiments, and
explain any behavioral situations without simplifying assumptions. Quantities
in such models precisely correspond to experimentally obtainable physiological
observables which determine statistical properties of central nervous system as
it represents different stimuli. Graphical method of consistently and
quantitatively at-a-glance interpreting or visualizing physiological data
within context of economic models is demonstrated.
