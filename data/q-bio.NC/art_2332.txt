Artificial Synaptic Arrays Intercoupled by Nanogranular Proton
  Conductors for Building Neuromorphic Systems
The highly parallel process in the neuron networks is mediated through a mass
of synaptic interconnections. Mimicking single synapse behaviors and highly
paralleled neural networks has become more and more fascinating and important.
Here, oxide-based artificial synaptic arrays are fabricated on P-doped
nanogranular SiO2-based proton conducting films at room temperature. Synaptic
plasticity is demonstrated on individual artificial synapse. Most importantly,
without any intentional hard-wired connection, such synaptic arrays are
intercoupled due to the electric-field induced lateral proton modulation. The
natural interconnection is weakly correlative with distance, and is important
for neural networks. At last, paralleled summation is also mimicked, which
provides a novel approach for building future brain-like computational systems.
