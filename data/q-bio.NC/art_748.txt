A unifying framework for understanding state-dependent network dynamics
  in cortex
Activity in neocortex exhibits a range of behaviors, from irregular to
temporally precise, and from weakly to strongly correlated. So far there has
been no single theoretical framework that could explain all these behaviors,
leaving open the possibility that they are a signature of radically different
mechanisms. Here, we suggest that this is not the case. Instead, we show that a
single theory can account for a broad spectrum of experimental observations,
including specifics such as the fine temporal details of subthreshold
cross-correlations. For the model underlying our theory, we need only assume a
small number of well-established properties common to all local cortical
networks. When these assumptions are combined with realistically structured
input, they produce exactly the repertoire of behaviors that is observed
experimentally, and lead to a number of testable predictions.
