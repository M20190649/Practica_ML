The multiplicity of memory enhancement: Practical and ethical
  implications of the diverse neural substrates underlying human memory systems
The neural basis of human memory is incredibly complex. We argue that the
diversity of neural systems underlying various forms of memory suggests that
any discussion of enhancing 'memory' per se is too broad, thus obfuscating the
biopolitical debate about human enhancement. Memory can be differentiated into
at least four major (and several minor) systems with largely dissociable (i.e.,
non-overlapping) neural substrates. We outline each system, and discuss both
the practical and the ethical implications of these diverse neural substrates.
In practice, distinct neural bases imply the possibility, and likely the
necessity, of specific approaches for the safe and effective enhancement of
various memory systems. In the debate over the ethical and social implications
of enhancement technologies, this fine-grained perspective clarifies - and may
partially mitigate - certain common concerns in enhancement debates, including
issues related to safety, fairness, coercion, and authenticity. While many
researchers certainly appreciate the neurobiological complexity of memory, the
political debate tends to revolve around a monolithic one-size-fits-all
conception. The overall project - exploring how human enhancement technologies
affect society - stands to benefit from a deeper appreciation of memory's
neurobiological diversity.
