The Effect of In vivo-like Synaptic Inputs on Stellate Cells
Previous experimental work has shown high-frequency Poisson-distributed
trains of combined excitatory and inhibitory conductance- and current-based
synaptic inputs reduce amplitude of subthreshold oscillations of SCs. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism underlying these phenomena in the context
of the model. More specially, we studied the effects of both conductance- and
current-based synaptic inputs at various maximal conductance values on a SC
model. Our numerical simulations show that conductance-based synaptic inputs
reduce the amplitude of SC's subthreshold oscillations for low enough value of
the maximal synaptic conductance value but amplify these oscillations at a
higher range. These results contrast with the experimental results.
