Classical versus quantum probability: Comments on the paper "On
  universality of classical probability with contextually labeled random
  variables" by E. Dzhafarov and M. Kon
Recently Dzhafarov and Kon published the paper advertising the possibility to
use the coupling technique of classical probability theory to model
incompatible observables in quantum physics and quantum-like models of
psychology. Here I present comments on this paper by stressing advantages and
disadvantages.
