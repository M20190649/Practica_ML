Instability of synchronized motion in nonlocally coupled neural
  oscillators
We study nonlocally coupled Hodgkin-Huxley equations with excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic coupling. We investigate the linear stability of the
synchronized solution, and find numerically various nonuniform oscillatory
states such as chimera states, wavy states, clustering states, and
spatiotemporal chaos as a result of the instability.
