Statistical mechanics of phase-space partitioning in large-scale spiking
  neuron circuits
Synaptic interactions structure the phase space of the dynamics of neural
circuits and constrain neural computation. Understanding how requires methods
that handle those discrete interactions, yet few exist. Recently, it was
discovered that even random networks exhibit dynamics that partitions the phase
space into numerous attractor basins. Here we utilize this phenomenon to
develop theory for the geometry of phase space partitioning in spiking neural
circuits. We find basin boundaries structuring the phase space are pre-images
of spike-time collision events. Formulating a statistical theory of spike-time
collision events, we derive expressions for the rate of divergence of
neighboring basins and for their size distribution. This theory reveals that
the typical basin diameter grows with inhibitory coupling strength and shrinks
with the rate of spike events. Our study provides an analytical and
generalizable approach for dissecting how connectivity, coupling strength,
single neuron dynamics and population activity shape the phase space geometry
of spiking circuits.
