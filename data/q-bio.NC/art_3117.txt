Adaptive Scales of Spatial Integration and Response Latencies in a
  Critically-Balanced Model of the Primary Visual Cortex
The brain processes visual inputs having structure over a large range of
spatial scales. The precise mechanisms or algorithms used by the brain to
achieve this feat are largely unknown and an open problem in visual
neuroscience. In particular, the spatial extent in visual space over which
primary visual cortex (V1) performs evidence integration has been shown to
change as a function of contrast and other visual parameters, thus adapting
scale in visual space in an input-dependent manner. We demonstrate that a
simple dynamical mechanism---dynamical criticality---can simultaneously account
for the well-documented input-dependence characteristics of three properties of
V1: scales of integration in visuotopic space, extents of lateral integration
on the cortical surface, and response latencies.
