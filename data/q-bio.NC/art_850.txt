Network cloning using DNA barcodes
The ability to measure or manipulate network connectivity is the main
challenge in the field of connectomics. Recently, a set of approaches has been
developed that takes advantage of next generation DNA sequencing to scan
connections between neurons into a set of DNA barcodes. Individual DNA
sequences called markers represent single neurons, while pairs of markers,
called barcodes contain information about connections. Here we propose a
strategy for 'copying' or 'cloning' connectivity contained in barcodes into a
clean slate tabula rasa network. We show that a one marker one cell (OMOC)
rule, which forces all markers with the same sequence to condense into the same
neuron, leads to fast and reliable formation of desired connectivity in a new
network. We show that OMOC rule yields convergence in a number of steps given
by a power law function of the network size. We thus propose that copying
network connectivity from one network to another is theoretically possible.
