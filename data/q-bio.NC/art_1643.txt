The nature of the animacy organization in human ventral temporal cortex
The principles underlying the animacy organization of the ventral temporal
cortex (VTC) remain hotly debated, with recent evidence pointing to an animacy
continuum rather than a dichotomy. What drives this continuum? According to the
visual categorization hypothesis, the continuum reflects the degree to which
animals contain animal-diagnostic features. By contrast, the agency hypothesis
posits that the continuum reflects the degree to which animals are perceived as
(social) agents. Here, we tested both hypotheses with a stimulus set in which
visual categorizability and agency were dissociated based on representations in
convolutional neural networks and behavioral experiments. Using fMRI, we found
that visual categorizability and agency explained independent components of the
animacy continuum in VTC. Modeled together, they fully explained the animacy
continuum. Finally, clusters explained by visual categorizability were
localized posterior to clusters explained by agency. These results show that
multiple organizing principles, including agency, underlie the animacy
continuum in VTC.
