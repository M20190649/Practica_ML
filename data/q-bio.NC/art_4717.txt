Deep brain fluorescence imaging with minimally invasive ultra-thin
  optical fibers
A major open challenge in neuroscience is the ability to measure and perturb
neural activity in vivo from well-defined neural sub-populations at cellular
resolution anywhere in the brain. However, limitations posed by scattering and
absorption prohibit non-invasive (surface) multiphoton approaches for deep
(>2mm) structures, while Gradient Refreactive Index (GRIN) endoscopes are thick
and cause significant damage upon insertion. Here, we demonstrate a novel
microendoscope to image neural activity at arbitrary depths via an ultrathin
multimode optical fiber (MMF) probe that is 5-10X thinner than commercially
available microendoscopes. We demonstrate micron-scale resolution,
multispectral and volumetric imaging. In contrast to previous approaches, we
show that this method has an improved acquisition speed that is sufficient to
capture rapid neuronal dynamics in-vivo in rodents expressing a genetically
encoded calcium indicator. Our results emphasize the potential of this
technology in neuroscience applications and open up possibilities for cellular
resolution imaging in previously unreachable brain regions.
