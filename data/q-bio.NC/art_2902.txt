Spin and Wind Directions I: Identifying Entanglement in Nature and
  Cognition
We present a cognitive psychology experiment where participants were asked to
select pairs of spatial directions that they considered to be the best example
of 'Two Different Wind Directions'. Data are shown to violate the CHSH version
of Bell's inequality with the same magnitude as in typical Bell-test
experiments with entangled spins. Wind directions thus appear to be conceptual
entities connected through meaning, in human cognition, in a similar way as
spins appear to be entangled in experiments conducted in physics laboratories.
This is the first part of a two-part article. In the second part we present a
symmetrized version of the same experiment for which we provide a quantum
modeling of the collected data in Hilbert space.
