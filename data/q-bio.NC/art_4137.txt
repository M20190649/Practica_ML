Stochastic dynamics of lexicon learning in an uncertain and nonuniform
  world
We study the time taken by a language learner to correctly identify the
meaning of all words in a lexicon under conditions where many plausible
meanings can be inferred whenever a word is uttered. We show that the most
basic form of cross-situational learning - whereby information from multiple
episodes is combined to eliminate incorrect meanings - can perform badly when
words are learned independently and meanings are drawn from a nonuniform
distribution. If learners further assume that no two words share a common
meaning, we find a phase transition between a maximally-efficient learning
regime, where the learning time is reduced to the shortest it can possibly be,
and a partially-efficient regime where incorrect candidate meanings for words
persist at late times. We obtain exact results for the word-learning process
through an equivalence to a statistical mechanical problem of enumerating loops
in the space of word-meaning mappings.
