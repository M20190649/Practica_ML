Low Frequency LFP in Macaque MT Predicts Reaction Time in an Attentive
  Task
Neural oscillations are related to a wide variety of cognitive functions,
including attention. However, there is still a controversy over the frequency
bands that have functional roles in attention. In this study, using a spatial
attention task we found that phase of low frequency oscillations could predict
the reaction time of the monkey, when the monkey is attending to the target
stimulus as opposed to attending a distractor. This finding provides strong
evidence for the functional role of low frequency bands in attentional
modulation of neural activities.
