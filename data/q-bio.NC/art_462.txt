Spike timing prediction with active dendrites
A complete single-neuron model must correctly reproduce the firing of spikes
and bursts. We present a study of a simplified model of deep pyramidal cells of
the cortex with active dendrites. We hypothesized that we can model the soma
and its apical tuft with only two compartments, without significant loss in the
accuracy of spike-timing predictions. The model is based on experimentally
measurable impulse-response functions, which transfer the effect of current
injected in one compartment to current reaching the other. Each compartment was
modeled with a pair of non-linear differential equations and a small number of
parameters that approximate the Hodgkin-and-Huxley equations. The predictive
power of this model was tested on electrophysiological experiments where noisy
current was injected in both the soma and the apical dendrite simultaneously.
We conclude that a simple two-compartment model can predict spike times of
pyramidal cells stimulated in the soma and dendrites simultaneously. Our
results support that regenerating activity in the dendritic tuft is required to
properly account for the dynamics of layer 5 pyramidal cells under in-vivo-like
conditions.
