Thermodynamic Neural Network
This work describes a thermodynamically motivated neural network model that
self-organizes to transport charge associated with internal and external
potentials while in contact with a thermal bath. Isolated networks show
multiscale dynamics and evidence of phase transitions, and externally driven
networks evolve to efficiently connect external positive and negative
potentials. The model implements techniques for rapid, global, reversible,
conservative equilibration of node states followed by slow, local,
irreversible, dissipative adaptation of the edge states as a means to create
multiscale order. All interactions in the network are local and the network
structures can be generic and recurrent. The model integrates concepts of
fluctuation, dissipation, adaptation and equilibration and offers an
illustration of the thermodynamic evolution of organization in open systems.
The key conclusion of the work is that the dissipation of conserved physical
quantities can drive the self-organization of open thermodynamic systems.
