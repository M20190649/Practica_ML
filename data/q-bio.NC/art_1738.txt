Mental Stress: Source of Neurological Degeneration; Case of MS
Mental stress is a vague though familiar concept that accounts for an agency
of the good, the bad and the ugly, that operates in the brains of animated
beings, in response to environmental stressors. In this work, we provide
evidence for correlation of stressors with afflictions of MS throughout the
world, and put forward arguments in support of the fact that stressors can
render disruptions in the normal computational processes of the brain, defining
the innards of the mental stress, which in turn may lead to the onset of
physiologic adversities in the biologic systems, possibly rendering various
diseases, even one as MS. While the real cause of the disease is still not
known, major focus is put on the treatment of MS symptoms, aiming to slow down
its progress and to reduce the frequency of attacks. In this effort we
establish the link between MS and mental stress, through analyses of various
aspects of statistics of prevalence and incidence, available in the literature
[3-5], which lends itself to opening up of additional treatment possibilities
that could be used separate of, or conjunctively with, the medical approaches.
On a grander scale, publicizing the adverse workings of the mental stress and
its evils can attain statistical gains, in the incidence reduction.
