ElasticPath2Path: Automated morphological classification of neurons by
  elastic path matching
In the study of neurons, morphology influences function. The complexity in
the structure of neurons poses a challenge in the identification and analysis
of similar and dissimilar neuronal cells. Existing methodologies carry out
structural and geometrical simplifications, which substantially change the
morphological statistics. Using digitally-reconstructed neurons, we extend the
work of Path2Path as ElasticPath2Path, which seamlessly integrates the
graph-theoretic and differential-geometric frameworks. By decomposing a neuron
into a set of paths, we derive graph metrics, which are path concurrence and
path hierarchy. Next, we model each path as an elastic string to compute the
geodesic distance between the paths of a pair of neurons. Later, we formulate
the problem of finding the distance between two neurons as a path assignment
problem with a cost function combining the graph metrics and the geodesic
deformation of paths. ElasticPath2Path is shown to have superior performance
over the state of the art.
