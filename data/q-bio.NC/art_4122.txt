Dynamics and spike trains statistics in conductance-based
  Integrate-and-Fire neural networks with chemical and electric synapses
We investigate the effect of electric synapses (gap junctions) on collective
neuronal dynamics and spike statistics in a conductance-based
Integrate-and-Fire neural network, driven by a Brownian noise, where
conductances depend upon spike history. We compute explicitly the time
evolution operator and show that, given the spike-history of the network and
the membrane potentials at a given time, the further dynamical evolution can be
written in a closed form. We show that spike train statistics is described by a
Gibbs distribution whose potential can be approximated with an explicit
formula, when the noise is weak. This potential form encompasses existing
models for spike trains statistics analysis such as maximum entropy models or
Generalized Linear Models (GLM). We also discuss the different types of
correlations: those induced by a shared stimulus and those induced by neurons
interactions.
