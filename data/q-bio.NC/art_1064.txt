Significance of Natural Scene Statistics in Understanding the
  Anisotropies of Perceptual Filling-in at the Blind Spot
Psychophysical experiments reveal our horizontal preference in perceptual
filling-in at the blind spot. On the other hand, vertical preference is
exhibited in the case of tolerance in filling-in. What causes this anisotropy
in our perception? Building upon the general notion, that the functional
properties of the early visual system are shaped by the innate specification as
well as the statistics of the environment, we reasoned that the anisotropy in
filling-in could be understood in terms of anisotropy in orientation
distribution inherent to natural scene statistics. We examined this proposition
by investigating filling-in of bar stimuli on a Hierarchical Predictive Coding
model network. In response to bar stimuli, the model network, trained with
natural images, exhibited anisotropic filling-in performance at the blind spot
similar to reported in psychophysical experiments i.e. horizontal preference in
filling-in and vertical preference in tolerance of filling-in. We suggest that
the over-representation of horizontal contours in the natural scene contribute
to the observed horizontal superiority while the broader distribution of
vertical contours contributes to the observed vertical superiority in
tolerance. These results indicate that natural scene statistics plays a
significant role in determining the filling-in performance at the blind spot
and shaping the associated anisotropies.
