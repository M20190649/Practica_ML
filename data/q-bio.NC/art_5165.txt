High-order couplings in geometric complex networks of neurons
We explore the consequences of introducing higher-order interactions in a
geometric complex network of Morris-Lecar neurons. We focus on the regime where
travelling synchronization waves are observed out of a first-neighbours based
coupling, to evaluate the changes induced when higher-order dynamical
interactions are included. We observe that the travelling wave phenomenon gets
enhanced by these interactions, allowing the information to travel further in
the system without generating pathological full synchronization states. This
scheme could be a step towards a simple modelization of neuroglial networks.
