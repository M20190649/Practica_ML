Comment on "Experimental motivation and empirical consistency in minimal
  no-collapse quantum mechanics"
Schlosshauer has advanced a theory of minimal no-collapse quantum mechanics
for a decoherence-based subjective resolution of the measurement problem. The
basic premise being that superposition states are maintained beyond the retinal
apparatus, becoming correlated with neuronal arrays located in the occipital
lobe of the brain. Decoherence for these neurons in a superposition of firing
and resting, leads to an irreversible dynamical decoupling of the two branches,
resulting in the emergence of a single subjective perception. Based upon prior
retinal research, it is shown that his theory is untenable for several reasons.
