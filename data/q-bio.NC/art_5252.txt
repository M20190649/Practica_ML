Some inverse problems in biophysics
During the past few years the development of experimental techniques has
allowed the quantitative analysis of biological systems ranging from
neurobiology and molecular biology. This work focuses on the quantitative
description of these systems by means of theoretical and numerical tools
ranging from statistical physics to probability theory.
  This dissertation is divided in three parts, each of which has a different
biological system as its focus.
  The first such system is Infotaxis, an olfactory search algorithm proposed by
Vergassola et al. in 2007: we give a continuous formulation and we characterize
its performances.
  Secondly we will focus on single-molecule experiments, especially unzipping
of DNA molecules, whose experimental traces depend strongly on the DNA
sequence: we develop a detailed model of the dynamics for this kind of
experiments and then we propose several inference algorithm aiming at the
characterization of the genetic sequence.
  The last section is devoted to the description of an algorithm that allows
the inference of interactions between neurons given the recording of neural
activity from multi-electrode experiments; we propose an integrated software
that will allow the analysis of these data.
