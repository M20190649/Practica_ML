An FFT based measure of phase synchronization
In this paper phase of a signal has been viewed from a different angle.
According to this view a signal can have countably infinitely many phases, one
associated with each Fourier component. In other words each frequency has a
phase associated with it. It has been shown that if two signals are phase
synchronous then the difference between phases at a given component changes
very slowly across the subsequent components. This leads to an FFT based phase
synchronization measuring algorithm between any two signals. The algorithm does
not take any more time than the FFT itself. Mathematical motivations as well as
some results of implementation of the algorithm on artificially generated
signals and real EEG signals have been presented.
