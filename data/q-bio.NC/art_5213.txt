Physics of Psychophysics: Stevens and Weber-Fechner laws are transfer
  functions of excitable media
Sensory arrays made of coupled excitable elements can improve both their
input sensitivity and dynamic range due to collective non-linear wave
properties. This mechanism is studied in a neural network of electrically
coupled (e.g. via gap junctions) elements subject to a Poisson signal process.
The network response interpolates between a Weber-Fechner logarithmic law and a
Stevens power law depending on the relative refractory period of the cell.
Therefore, these non-linear transformations of the input level could be
performed in the sensory periphery simply due to a basic property: the transfer
function of excitable media.
