Rounding of abrupt phase transitions in brain networks
The observation of critical-like behavior in cortical networks represents a
major step forward in elucidating how the brain manages information.
Understanding the origin and functionality of critical-like dynamics, as well
as their robustness, is a major challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Here,
we present an extensive numerical study of a family of simple dynamic models,
which describe activity propagation in brain networks through the integration
of different neighboring spiking potentials, mimicking basic neural
interactions. The requirement of signal integration may lead to discontinuous
phase transitions in networks that are well described by the mean field
approximation, thus preventing the emergence of critical points in such
systems. Here we show that criticality in the brain is instead robust, as a
consequence of the hierarchical organization of the higher layers of cortical
networks, which signals a departure from the mean-field paradigm. We show that,
in finite-dimensional hierarchical networks, discontinuous phase transitions
exhibit a rounding phenomenon and turn continuous for values of the topological
dimension $D\le 2$, due to the presence of structural or topological disorder.
Our results may prove significant in explaining the observation of traits of
critical behavior in large-scale measurements of brain activity.
