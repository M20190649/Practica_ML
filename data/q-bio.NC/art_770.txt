A Chessboard Model of Human Brain and One Application on Memory Capacity
The famous claim that we only use about 10% of the brain capacity has
recently been challenged. Researchers argue that we are likely to use the whole
brain, against the 10% claim. Some evidence and results from relevant studies
and experiments related to memory in the field of neuroscience leads to the
conclusion that if the rest 90% of the brain is not used, then many neural
pathways would degenerate. What is memory? How does the brain function? What
would be the limit of memory capacity? This article provides a model
established upon the physiological and neurological characteristics of the
human brain, which could give some theoretical support and scientific
explanation to explain some phenomena. It may not only have theoretically
significance in neuroscience, but could also be practically useful to fill in
the gap between the natural and machine intelligence.
