Dendritic signal transmission induced by intracellular charge
  inhomogeneities
Signal propagation in neuronal dendrites represents the basis for interneuron
communication and information processing in the brain. Here we take into
account charge inhomogeneities arising in the vicinity of ion channels in
cytoplasm and obtained a modified cable equation. We show that the charge
inhomogeneities acting on the millisecond time scale can lead to the appearance
of propagating waves with wavelengths of hundreds of micrometers. They
correspond to a certain frequency band predicting the appearance of resonant
properties in brain neuron signalling.
