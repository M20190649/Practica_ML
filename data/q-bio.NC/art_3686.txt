Cultural diversity and the measurement of functional impairment: A
  cross-cultural validation of the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire
INTRODUCTION: Assessment of cognitively complex instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL) is important in (incipient) dementia, but little is known
about the influence of cultural differences. We aim to investigate the
cross-cultural comparability of IADL. METHODS: IADL were measured in 3,571
individuals (67.1 +- 9.5 years old, 44.7% female) in 11 international studies
using the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). Cultural, age and gender
bias were assessed on item level using differential item functioning (DIF) and
on scale level by calculating correlations between IADL and cognitive and
functional measures. RESULTS: We did not find meaningful bias on item or on
scale level, as indicated by low DIF effect sizes (R2 range 0-0.03) and
correlations in expected directions and of similar magnitude. DISCUSSION: Our
results suggest that IADL may be universally suitable as outcome measure. The
A-IADL-Q seems robust to demographic diversity and is capable of reliably
measuring IADL impairment.
