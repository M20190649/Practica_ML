Asymptotic Phase for Stochastic Oscillators
Oscillations and noise are ubiquitous in physical and biological systems.
When oscillations arise from a deterministic limit cycle, entrainment and
synchronization may be analyzed in terms of the asymptotic phase function. In
the presence of noise, the asymptotic phase is no longer well defined. We
introduce a new definition of asymptotic phase in terms of the slowest decaying
modes of the Kolmogorov backward operator. Our stochastic asymptotic phase is
well defined for noisy oscillators, even when the oscillations are noise
dependent. It reduces to the classical asymptotic phase in the limit of
vanishing noise. The phase can be obtained either by solving an eigenvalue
problem, or by empirical observation of an oscillating density's approach to
its steady state.
