A comparison of methods for the analysis of binomial proportion data in
  behavioral research
In behavioral and psychiatric research, data consisting of a per-subject
proportion of "successes" and "failures" over a finite number of trials often
arise. This kind of clustered binary data are usually non-normally distributed,
which can cause issues with parameter estimation and predictions if the usual
general linear model is applied and sample size is small. Here we studied the
performances of some of the available analytic methods applicable to the
analysis of proportion data; namely linear regression, Poisson regression,
beta-binomial regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We report
the conclusions from a simulation study evaluating power and Type I error rates
of these models in scenarios akin to those met by behavioral researchers and
differing in sample size, cluster size and fixed effects parameters; plus, we
describe results from the application of these methods on data from two real
behavioral experiments. Our results show that, while GLMMs and beta-binomial
regression are powerful instruments for the analysis of clustered binary
outcomes, linear approximation can still provide reliable hypothesis testing in
this context. Poisson regression, on the other hand, can suffer heavily from
model misspecification when used to model proportion data. We conclude
providing some guidelines for the choice of appropriate analytical instruments,
sample and cluster size depending on the conditions of the experiment.
