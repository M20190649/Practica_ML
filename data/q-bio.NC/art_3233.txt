Alterations in brain connectivity due to plasticity and synaptic delay
Brain plasticity refers to brain's ability to change neuronal connections, as
a result of environmental stimuli, new experiences, or damage. In this work, we
study the effects of the synaptic delay on both the coupling strengths and
synchronisation in a neuronal network with synaptic plasticity. We build a
network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, where the plasticity is given by the Hebbian
rules. We verify that without time delay the excitatory synapses became
stronger from the high frequency to low frequency neurons and the inhibitory
synapses increases in the opposite way, when the delay is increased the network
presents a non-trivial topology. Regarding the synchronisation, only for small
values of the synaptic delay this phenomenon is observed.
