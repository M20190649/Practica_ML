Neural Graphs and Category of Memory States
The brain as an astonishingly remarkable device has been studied from various
angles. It is now well known that neurons are the seat of all activities of the
brain function. The dynamical properties pertaining to a single neuron and a
collection of neurons may be widely different owing to the clustering
properties of a group of neurons. As it can be clearly understood theory of
complex physical systems has been more and more employed to study the behaviour
of neurons and neuronal circuits. We here mainly discuss neural correlates of
memory and cognitive functions utilizing graph theory and ideas from geometry.
It has been suggested that stochastic processes being at the helm of affairs in
the neuronal level there may exist surfaces to some extent like a hologram for
the existence of memory functions.It is also instructive to mention that
Amari's developments \cite{amari} as regards information geometry has acted as
an important inspiration. Unlike some previous analysis categorization of
memory from neural perspectives have been reconsidered at the neuronal level.
In essence the main point of discussion here has been to give an alternative
model of memory where stochastic geometry and algebraic surfaces is an
important ingredient.
