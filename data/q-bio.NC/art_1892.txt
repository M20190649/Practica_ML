From systems biology to dynamical neuropharmacology: proposal for a new
  methodology
The concepts and methods of Systems Biology are being extended to
neuropharmacology, to test and design drugs against neurological and
psychiatric disorders. Computational modeling by integrating compartmental
neural modeling technique and detailed kinetic description of pharmacological
modulation of transmitter-receptor interaction is offered as a method to test
the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of putative drugs. Even more,
an inverse method is suggested as a method for controlling a neural system to
realize a prescribed temporal pattern. In particular, as an application of the
proposed new methodology a computational platform is offered to analyze the
generation and pharmacological modulation of theta rhythm related to anxiety is
analyzed here in more detail.
