Ideomotor feedback control in a recurrent neural network
The architecture of a neural network controlling an unknown environment is
presented. It is based on a randomly connected recurrent neural network from
which both perception and action are simultaneously read and fed back. There
are two concurrent learning rules implementing a sort of ideomotor control: (i)
perception is learned along the principle that the network should predict
reliably its incoming stimuli; (ii) action is learned along the principle that
the prediction of the network should match a target time series. The coherent
behavior of the neural network in its environment is a consequence of the
interaction between the two principles. Numerical simulations show the
promising performance of the approach, which can be turned into a local, and
thus "biologically plausible", algorithm.
