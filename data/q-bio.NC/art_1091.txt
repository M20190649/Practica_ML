Average activity of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations
We develop an extension of the Ott-Antonsen method that allows obtaining the
mean activity (spiking rate) of a population of excitable units. By means of
the Ott-Antonsen method, equations for the dynamics of the order parameters of
coupled excitatory and inhibitory populations of excitable units are obtained,
and their mean activities are computed. Two different excitable systems are
studied: Adler units and theta neurons. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are
compared to those obtained from studying the phenomenological Wilson-Cowan
model in some regions of the parameter space. Compatible behaviors, as well as
higher dimensional chaotic solutions, are observed. We study numerical
simulations to further validate the equations.
