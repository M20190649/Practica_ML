The Neurobiology Of Thinking, Identity, And Geniality
  Abstract: Mathematically the axioms of representation are subtle, and
critical. The CNS expresses its function via its internal neuronal networks in
multidimensional, intrinsic frames. CNS operation can be represented by tensor
transformations within and among general frames of reference. So-called
metaorganization principle is transforming the dual representations of
intention from one to another. The property of intentionality refers to the
fact that consciousness is about objects or events, and is modulated by
attention. To construct a new neural framework we must outgoing basicly from
the competitive interactions among widely distributed groups of neurons. A
major system in this regard is the thalamocortical system. The integrative
dynamics of conscious experience suggests that the thalamocortical system
behaves as a functional cluster that interacts mainly with itself.
