Receptor arrays optimized for natural odor statistics
Natural odors typically consist of many molecules at different
concentrations. It is unclear how the numerous odorant molecules and their
possible mixtures are discriminated by relatively few olfactory receptors.
Using an information-theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal
for this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) each receptor
should respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different
receptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with
natural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the
affinities between receptors and odorant molecules for a broad class of odor
statistics. We also show that optimal receptor arrays can be tuned to either
resolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably. Finally, we use
our results to predict properties of experimentally measured receptor arrays.
Our work can thus be used to better understand natural olfaction and it also
suggests ways to improve artificial sensor arrays.
