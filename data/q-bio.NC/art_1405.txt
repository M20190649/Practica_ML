Consciousness as a physical process caused by the organization of energy
  in the brain
To explain consciousness as a physical process we must acknowledge the role
of energy in the brain. Energetic activity is fundamental to all physical
processes and causally drives biological behaviour. Recent neuroscientific
evidence can be interpreted in a way that suggests consciousness is a product
of the organization of energetic activity in the brain. The nature of energy
itself, though, remains largely mysterious, and we do not fully understand how
it contributes to brain function or consciousness. According to the principle
outlined here, energy, along with forces and work, can be described as
actualized differences of motion and tension. By observing physical systems, we
can infer there is something it is like to undergo actualized difference from
the intrinsic perspective of the system. Consciousness occurs because there is
something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo a certain organization of
actualized differences in the brain.
