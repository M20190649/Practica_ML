A simple model for low variability in neural spike trains
Neural noise sets a limit to information transmission in sensory systems. In
several areas, the spiking response (to a repeated stimulus) has shown a higher
degree of regularity than predicted by a Poisson process. However, a simple
model to explain this low variability is still lacking. Here we introduce a new
model, with a correction to Poisson statistics, which can accurately predict
the regularity of neural spike trains in response to a repeated stimulus. The
model has only two parameters, but can reproduce the observed variability in
retinal recordings in various conditions. We show analytically why this
approximation can work. In a model of the spike emitting process where a
refractory period is assumed, we derive that our simple correction can well
approximate the spike train statistics over a broad range of firing rates. Our
model can be easily plugged to stimulus processing models, like
Linear-nonlinear model or its generalizations, to replace the Poisson spike
train hypothesis that is commonly assumed. It estimates the amount of
information transmitted much more accurately than Poisson models in retinal
recordings. Thanks to its simplicity this model has the potential to explain
low variability in other areas.
