The Cross-Domain Re-interpretation of Artistic Ideas
The goal of this study was to investigate the translation of creative works
into other domains. We tested whether people were able to recognize which works
of art were inspired by which pieces of music. Three expert painters created
four paintings, each of which was the artist's interpretation of one of four
different pieces of instrumental music. Participants were able to identify
which paintings were inspired by which pieces of music at statistically
significant above chance levels. The findings support the hypothesis that
creative ideas can exist in an at least somewhat domain independent state of
potentiality and become more well defined as they are actualized in accordance
with the constraints of a particular domain.
