What can topology tell us about the neural code?
Neuroscience is undergoing a period of rapid experimental progress and
expansion. New mathematical tools, previously unknown in the neuroscience
community, are now being used to tackle fundamental questions and analyze
emerging data sets. Consistent with this trend, the last decade has seen an
uptick in the use of topological ideas and methods in neuroscience. In this
talk I will survey recent applications of topology in neuroscience, and explain
why topology is an especially natural tool for understanding neural codes.
Note: This is a write-up of my talk for the Current Events Bulletin, held at
the 2016 Joint Math Meetings in Seattle, WA.
