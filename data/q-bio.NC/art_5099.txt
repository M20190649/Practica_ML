On early brain folding patterns using biomechanical growth modeling
Abnormal cortical folding patterns may be related to neurodevelopmental
disorders such as lissencephaly and polymicrogyria. In this context,
computational modeling is a powerful tool to provide a better understanding of
the early brain folding process. Recent studies based on biomechanical modeling
have shown that mechanical forces play a crucial role in the formation of
cortical convolutions. However, the correlation between simulation results and
biological facts, and the effect of physical parameters in these models remain
unclear. In this paper, we propose a new brain longitudinal length growth model
to improve brain model growth. In addition, we investigate the effect of the
initial cortical thickness on folding patterns, quantifying the folds by the
surface-based three-dimensional gyrification index and a spectral analysis of
gyrification. The results tend to show that the use of such biomechanical
models could highlight the links between neurodevelopmental diseases and
physical parameters.
