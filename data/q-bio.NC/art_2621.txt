Activity of any neuron with delayed feedback stimulated with Poisson
  stream is non-Markov
For a class of excitatory spiking neuron models with delayed feedback fed
with a Poisson stochastic process, it is proven that the stream of output
interspike intervals cannot be presented as a Markov process of any order.
