Cell-type-specific microarray data and the Allen atlas: quantitative
  analysis of brain-wide patterns of correlation and density
The Allen Atlas of the adult mouse brain is used to estimate the
region-specificity of 64 cell types whose transcriptional profile in the mouse
brain has been measured in microarray experiments. We systematically analyze
the preliminary results presented in [arXiv:1111.6217], using the techniques
implemented in the Brain Gene Expression Analysis toolbox. In particular, for
each cell-type-specific sample in the study, we compute a brain-wide
correlation profile to the Allen Atlas, and estimate a brain-wide density
profile by solving a quadratic optimization problem at each voxel in the mouse
brain. We characterize the neuroanatomical properties of the correlation and
density profiles by ranking the regions of the left hemisphere delineated in
the Allen Reference Atlas. We compare these rankings to prior biological
knowledge of the brain region from which the cell-type-specific sample was
extracted.
