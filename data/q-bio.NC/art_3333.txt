A Theoretical Limit to Physicalism: A Non-Technical Explanation of the
  Gemini Theorem
The Gemini theorem asserts that, given certain reasonable assumptions, no
physical system can be certainly aware of its own existence. The theorem can be
proved algorithmically, but the proof of this theorem is somewhat obscure, and
there exists very little literature on it. The purpose of this article is to
provide a brief non-technical summary of the theorem and its proof, with a view
to stimulating critical discussion of the proof and its implications. Since the
theorem implies that a violation of the conservation of energy will take place
within the brains of conscious human beings, it has obvious implications for
any physical theory.
