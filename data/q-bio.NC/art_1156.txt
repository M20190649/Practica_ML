Autonomous line follower robot controlled by cell culture
Neuro-electronic hybrid promises to bring up a model architecture for
computing. Such computing architecture could help to bring the power of
biological connection and electronic circuits together for better computing
paradigm. Such paradigms for solving real world tasks with higher accuracy is
on demand now. A robot as a autonomous system is modeled here to navigate
following a particular line. Sensory inputs from robot is directed as input to
the cell culture in response to which motor commands are generated from the
culture.
