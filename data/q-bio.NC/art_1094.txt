Flexible Metal Oxide/Graphene Oxide Hybrid Neuromorphic Devices on
  Flexible Conducting Graphene Substrates
Flexible metal oxide/graphene oxide hybrid multi-gate neuron transistors were
fabricated on flexible graphene substrates. Dendritic integrations in both
spatial and temporal modes were successfully emulated, and spatiotemporal
correlated logics were obtained. A proof-of-principle visual system model for
emulating lobula giant motion detector neuron was investigated. Our results are
of great interest for flexible neuromorphic cognitive systems.
