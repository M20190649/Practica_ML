Reply to Commentaries on 'An Evolutionary Framework for Cultural Change:
  Selectionism versus Communal Exchange'
The commentators have brought a wealth of new perspectives to the question of
how culture evolves. Each of their diverse disciplines--ranging from psychology
to biology to anthropology to economics to engineering--has a valuable
contribution to make to our understanding of this complex, multifaceted topic.
Though the vast majority of their comments were supportive of my approach, it
is natural that a reply such as this focus on points where my views differ from
that of the commentators. ... I conclude by saying that I am grateful to the
commentators for their diverse perspectives and insights, their overall support
for the project, and provocative ideas for where to go from here. Clearly there
are many fascinating avenues to explore as we move forward on our quest to
understand how culture evolves.
