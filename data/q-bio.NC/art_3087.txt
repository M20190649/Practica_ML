An integrate-and-fire model to generate spike trains with long-range
  dependence
Long-range dependence (LRD) has been observed in a variety of phenomena in
nature, and for several years also in the spiking activity of neurons. Often,
this is interpreted as originating from a non-Markovian system. Here we show
that a purely Markovian integrate-and-fire (IF) model, with a noisy slow
adaptation term, can generate interspike intervals (ISIs) that appear as having
LRD. However a proper analysis shows that this is not the case asymptotically.
For comparison, we also consider a new model of individual IF neuron with
fractional (non-Markovian) noise. The correlations of its spike trains are
studied and proven to have LRD, unlike classical IF models. On the other hand,
to correctly measure long-range dependence, it is usually necessary to know if
the data are stationary. Thus, a methodology to evaluate stationarity of the
ISIs is presented and applied to the various IF models. We explain that
Markovian IF models may seem to have LRD because of non-stationarities.
