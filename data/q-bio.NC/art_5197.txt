Network Mechanism for Insect Olfaction
Early olfactory pathway responses to the presentation of an odor exhibit
remarkably similar characteristics across phyla from insects to mammals, and
frequently involve transitions among quiescence, collective network
oscillations, and asynchronous firing. We investigate whether a robust
bifurcation structure can describe such transitions, and take the locust, which
appears to have one of the simpler early olfactory pathway architectures, as a
representative example. Using an integrate-and-fire (I\&F) model, we reproduce
relevant results of both experimental measurements and detailed models of early
olfaction dynamics and odor discrimination. By further idealizing the I\&F
description and finally reducing it to a firing-rate (FR) model, we find the
bifurcation structure underlying a transition typical of the early odor
response to be a slow passage through a saddle-node-on-an-invariant-circle
(SNIC) bifurcation, which arises due to the interaction among the fast-varying
excitation and fast and slowly-varying inhibition.
