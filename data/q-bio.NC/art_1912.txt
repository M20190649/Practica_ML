The Violation of Bell Inequalities in the Macroworld
We show that Bell inequalities can be violated in the macroscopic world. The
macroworld violation is illustrated using an example involving connected
vessels of water. We show that whether the violation of inequalities occurs in
the microworld or in the macroworld, it is the identification of nonidentical
events that plays a crucial role. Specifically, we prove that if nonidentical
events are consistently differentiated, Bell-type Pitowsky inequalities are no
longer violated, even for Bohm's example of two entangled spin 1/2 quantum
particles. We show how Bell inequalities can be violated in cognition,
specifically in the relationship between abstract concepts and specific
instances of these concepts. This supports the hypothesis that genuine quantum
structure exists in the mind. We introduce a model where the amount of
nonlocality and the degree of quantum uncertainty are parameterized, and
demonstrate that increasing nonlocality increases the degree of violation,
while increasing quantum uncertainty decreases the degree of violation.
