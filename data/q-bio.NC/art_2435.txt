A Quantum Information Retrieval Approach to Memory
As computers approach the physical limits of information storable in memory,
new methods will be needed to further improve information storage and
retrieval. We propose a quantum inspired vector based approach, which offers a
contextually dependent mapping from the subsymbolic to the symbolic
representations of information. If implemented computationally, this approach
would provide exceptionally high density of information storage, without the
traditionally required physical increase in storage capacity. The approach is
inspired by the structure of human memory and incorporates elements of
Gardenfors' Conceptual Space approach and Humphreys et al.'s matrix model of
memory.
