Enlarging the scope: grasping brain complexity
To further advance our understanding of the brain, new concepts and theories
are needed. In particular, the ability of the brain to create information flows
must be reconciled with its propensity for synchronization and mass action. The
framework of Coordination Dynamics and the theory of metastability are
presented as a starting point to study the interplay of integrative and
segregative tendencies that are expressed in space and time during the normal
course of brain function. Some recent shifts in perspective are emphasized,
that may ultimately lead to a better understanding of brain complexity.
