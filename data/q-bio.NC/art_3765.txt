Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli
We study a wide field motion sensitive neuron in the visual system of the
blowfly {\em Calliphora vicina}. By rotating the fly on a stepper motor outside
in a wooded area, and along an angular motion trajectory representative of
natural flight, we stimulate the fly's visual system with input that approaches
the natural situation. The neural response is analyzed in the framework of
information theory, using methods that are free from assumptions. We
demonstrate that information about the motion trajectory increases as the light
level increases over a natural range. This indicates that the fly's brain
utilizes the increase in photon flux to extract more information from the
photoreceptor array, suggesting that imprecision in neural signals is dominated
by photon shot noise in the physical input, rather than by noise generated
within the nervous system itself.
