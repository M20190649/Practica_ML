Bi-phase age-related brain gray matter magnetic resonance T1rho
  relaxation time change
Objectives: To investigate normative value and age-related change of brain
magnetic resonance T1rho relaxation at 1.5 T. Methods: 20 males (age:
40.7+/-15.5 years, range: 22-68 years) and 22 females (age: 38.5 +/-14.8 years,
range: 21-62 years), were scanned at 1.5 Tesla using 3D fluid suppressed turbo
spin echo sequence. Regions-of-interests (ROIs) were obtained by atlas-based
tissue segmentation and T1rho was calculated by fitting the mean value to
monoexponential model. Correlation between T1rho relaxation of brain gray
matter regions and age was investigated. Results: A regional difference among
individual gray matter areas was noted; with hippocampus (98.37+/-5.37 msec)
and amygdala (94.95+/-4.34 msec) have the highest measurement, while pallidum
(83.81+/-5.49) and putamen (83.93+4.76) the lowest measurement. T1rho values
decreased slowly (mean slope: -0.256) and significantly (p<0.05) with age in
gray matter for subjects younger than 40 years old, while for subjects older
than 40 years old there was no significant correlation between T1rho relaxation
and age. Conclusion: T1rho relaxation demonstrates a bi-phase change with age
in adults of 22-68 years.
