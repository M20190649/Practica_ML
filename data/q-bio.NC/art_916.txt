Integrating EEG and MEG signals to improve motor imagery classification
  in brain-computer interfaces
We propose a fusion approach that combines features from simultaneously
recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
signals to improve classification performances in motor imagery-based
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We applied our approach to a group of 15
healthy subjects and found a significant classification performance enhancement
as compared to standard single-modality approaches in the alpha and beta bands.
Taken together, our findings demonstrate the advantage of considering
multimodal approaches as complementary tools for improving the impact of
non-invasive BCIs.
