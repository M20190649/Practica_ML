Decoding of neural data using cohomological feature extraction
We introduce a novel data-driven approach to discover and decode features in
the neural code coming from large population neural recordings with minimal
assumptions, using cohomological feature extraction. We apply our approach to
neural recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular
feature. We then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head
direction of the mouse. Thus we capture head direction cells and decode the
head direction from the neural population activity without having to process
the behaviour of the mouse. Interestingly, the decoded values convey more
information about the neural activity than the tracked head direction does,
with differences that have some spatial organization. Finally, we note that the
residual population activity, after the head direction has been accounted for,
retains some low-dimensional structure which is correlated with the speed of
the mouse.
