Direct Estimation of Firing Rates from Calcium Imaging Data
Two-photon imaging of calcium indicators allows simultaneous recording of
responses of hundreds of neurons over hours and even days, but provides a
relatively indirect measure of their spiking activity. Existing deconvolution
algorithms attempt to recover spikes from observed imaging data, which are then
commonly subjected to the same analyses that are applied to
electrophysiologically recorded spikes (e.g., estimation of average firing
rates, or tuning curves). Here we show, however, that in the presence of noise
this approach is often heavily biased. We propose an alternative analysis that
aims to estimate the underlying rate directly, by integrating over the
unobserved spikes instead of committing to a single estimate of the spike
train. This approach can be used to estimate average firing rates or tuning
curves directly from the imaging data, and is sufficiently flexible to
incorporate prior knowledge about tuning structure. We show that directly
estimated rates are more accurate than those obtained from averaging of spikes
estimated through deconvolution, both on simulated data and on imaging data
acquired in mouse visual cortex.
