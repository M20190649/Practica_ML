The Hard Problem of Consciousness: A Mathematical Approach
We can potentially make progress on the hard problem of consciousness
(Chalmers, 1995), the seemingly intractable problem of explaining how qualia
arise from certain physical systems, via the mathematically tractable problem
of explaining how objectively unmeasurable aspects (identified with qualia)
could arise from certain physical systems that are otherwise objectively
measurable. In short, it is proposed that qualia may correspond to
non-divergent singularities in the mathematical descriptions of certain aspects
of certain complex physical systems. This proposal may have been foreshadowed
by Srinivasa Ramanujan. It could have significant implications for the
prospects of the experimental verification of consciousness in physical systems
and for the prospects of the generation of artificial consciousness (AC).
