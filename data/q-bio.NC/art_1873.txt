Speed of synchronization in complex networks of neural oscillators
  Analytic results based on Random Matrix Theory
We analyze the dynamics of networks of spiking neural oscillators. First, we
present an exact linear stability theory of the synchronous state for networks
of arbitrary connectivity. For general neuron rise functions, stability is
determined by multiple operators, for which standard analysis is not suitable.
We describe a general non-standard solution to the multi-operator problem.
Subsequently, we derive a class of rise functions for which all stability
operators become degenerate and standard eigenvalue analysis becomes a suitable
tool. Interestingly, this class is found to consist of networks of leaky
integrate and fire neurons. For random networks of inhibitory
integrate-and-fire neurons, we then develop an analytical approach, based on
the theory of random matrices, to precisely determine the eigenvalue
distribution. This yields the asymptotic relaxation time for perturbations to
the synchronous state which provides the characteristic time scale on which
neurons can coordinate their activity in such networks. For networks with
finite in-degree, i.e. finite number of presynaptic inputs per neuron, we find
a speed limit to coordinating spiking activity: Even with arbitrarily strong
interaction strengths neurons cannot synchronize faster than at a certain
maximal speed determined by the typical in-degree.
