Derivatives and inverse of a linear-nonlinear multi-layer spatial vision
  model
Linear-nonlinear transforms are interesting in vision science because they
are key in modeling a number of perceptual experiences such as color, motion or
spatial texture. Here we first show that a number of issues in vision may be
addressed through an analytic expression of the Jacobian of these
linear-nonlinear transforms. The particular model analyzed afterwards (an
extension of [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 2015]) is illustrative because it consists
of a cascade of standard linear-nonlinear modules. Each module roughly
corresponds to a known psychophysical mechanism: (1) linear spectral
integration and nonlinear brightness-from-luminance computation, (2) linear
pooling of local brightness and nonlinear normalization for local contrast
computation, (3) linear frequency selectivity and nonlinear normalization for
spatial contrast masking, and (4) linear wavelet-like decomposition and
nonlinear normalization for frequency-dependent masking. Beyond being the
appropriate technical report with the missing details in [Malo & Simoncelli
SPIE 2015], the interest of the presented analytic results and numerical
methods transcend the particular model because of the ubiquity of the
linear-nonlinear structure. Part of this material was presented at MODVIS 2016
(see slides of the conference talk in the appendix at the end of this
document).
