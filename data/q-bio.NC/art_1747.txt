Self-Wiring of Neural Networks
In order to form the intricate network of synaptic connections in the brain,
the growth cones migrate through the embryonic environment to their targets
using chemical communication. As a first step to study self-wiring, 2D model
systems of neurons have been used. We present a simple model to reproduce the
salient features of the 2D systems. The model incorporates random walkers
representing the growth cones, which migrate in response to chemotaxis
substances extracted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the
soma by means of attractive chemotactic "feedback".
