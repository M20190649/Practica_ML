Mean-field dynamics of a random neural network with noise
We consider a network of randomly coupled rate-based neurons influenced by
external and internal noise. We derive a second-order stochastic mean-field
model for the network dynamics and use it to analyze the stability and
bifurcations in the thermodynamic limit, as well as to study the fluctuations
due to the finite-size effect. It is demonstrated that the two types of noise
have substantially different impact on the network dynamics. While both sources
of noise give rise to stochastic fluctuations in the case of the finite-size
network, only the external noise affects the stationary activity levels of the
network in the thermodynamic limit.We compare the theoretical predictions with
the direct simulation results and show that they agree for large enough network
sizes and for parameter domains sufficiently away from bifurcations.
