Energy and information in Hodgkin-Huxley neurons
The generation of spikes by neurons is energetically a costly process and the
evaluation of the metabolic energy required to maintain the signalling activity
of neurons a challenge of practical interest. Neuron models are frequently used
to represent the dynamics of real neurons but hardly ever to evaluate the
electrochemical energy required to maintain that dynamics. This paper discusses
the interpretation of a Hodgkin-Huxley circuit as an energy model for real
biological neurons and uses it to evaluate the consumption of metabolic energy
in the transmission of information between neurons coupled by electrical
synapses, i.e. gap junctions. We show that for a single postsynaptic neuron
maximum energy efficiency, measured in bits of mutual information per ATP
molecule consumed, requires maximum energy consumption. On the contrary, for
groups of parallel postsynaptic neurons we determine values of the synaptic
conductance at which the energy efficiency of the transmission presents clear
maxima at relatively very low values of metabolic energy consumption. Contrary
to what it could be expected best performance occurs at low energy cost.
