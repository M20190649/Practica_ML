Creative Thought as a nonDarwinian Evolutionary Process
Selection theory requires multiple, distinct, simultaneously-actualized
states. In cognition, each thought or cognitive state changes the 'selection
pressure' against which the next is evaluated; they are not simultaneously
selected amongst. Creative thought is more a matter of honing in a vague idea
through redescribing successive iterations of it from different real or
imagined perspectives; in other words, actualizing potential through exposure
to different contexts. It has been proven that the mathematical description of
contextual change of state introduces a non-Kolmogorovian probability
distribution, and a classical formalism such as selection theory cannot be
used. This paper argues that creative thought evolves not through a Darwinian
process, but a process of context-driven actualization of potential.
