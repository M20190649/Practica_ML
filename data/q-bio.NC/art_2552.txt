Detecting event-related recurrences by symbolic analysis: Applications
  to human language processing
Quasistationarity is ubiquitous in complex dynamical systems. In brain
dynamics there is ample evidence that event-related potentials reflect such
quasistationary states. In order to detect them from time series, several
segmentation techniques have been proposed. In this study we elaborate a recent
approach for detecting quasistationary states as recurrence domains by means of
recurrence analysis and subsequent symbolisation methods. As a result,
recurrence domains are obtained as partition cells that can be further aligned
and unified for different realisations. We address two pertinent problems of
contemporary recurrence analysis and present possible solutions for them.
