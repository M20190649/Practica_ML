Biological Impact on Military Intelligence: Application or Metaphor?
Ideas by Statistical Mechanics (ISM) is a generic program to model evolution
and propagation of ideas/patterns throughout populations subjected to
endogenous and exogenous interactions. The program is based on the author's
work in Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions (SMNI). This product
can be used for decision support for projects ranging from diplomatic,
information, military, and economic (DIME) factors of propagation/evolution of
ideas, to commercial sales, trading indicators across sectors of financial
markets, advertising and political campaigns, etc. It seems appropriate to base
an approach for propagation of ideas on the only system so far demonstrated to
develop and nurture ideas, i.e., the neocortical brain. The issue here is
whether such biological intelligence is a valid application to military
intelligence, or is it simply a metaphor?
