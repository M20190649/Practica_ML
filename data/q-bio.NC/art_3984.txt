Event-driven simulations of a plastic, spiking neural network
We consider a fully-connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons
with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The plasticity is controlled by a
parameter representing the expected weight of a synapse between neurons that
are firing randomly with the same mean frequency. For low values of the
plasticity parameter, the activities of the system are dominated by noise,
while large values of the plasticity parameter lead to self-sustaining activity
in the network. We perform event-driven simulations on finite-size networks
with up to 128 neurons to find the stationary synaptic weight conformations for
different values of the plasticity parameter. In both the low and high activity
regimes, the synaptic weights are narrowly distributed around the plasticity
parameter value consistent with the predictions of mean-field theory. However,
the distribution broadens in the transition region between the two regimes,
representing emergent network structures. Using a pseudophysical approach for
visualization, we show that the emergent structures are of "path" or "hub"
type, observed at different values of the plasticity parameter in the
transition region.
