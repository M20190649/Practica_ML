Influence of initial fixation position in scene viewing
During scene perception our eyes generate complex sequences of fixations.
Predictors of fixation locations are bottom-up factors like luminance contrast,
top-down factors like viewing instruction, and systematic biases like the
tendency to place fixations near the center of an image. However, comparatively
little is known about the dynamics of scanpaths after experimental manipulation
of specific fixation locations. Here we investigate the influence of initial
fixation position on subsequent eye-movement behavior on an image. We presented
64 colored photographs to participants who started their scanpaths from one of
two experimentally controlled positions in the right or left part of an image.
Additionally, we computed the images' saliency maps and classified them as
balanced images or images with high saliency values on either the left or right
side of a picture. As a result of the starting point manipulation, we found
long transients of mean fixation position and a tendency to overshoot to the
image side opposite to the starting position. Possible mechanisms for the
generation of this overshoot were investigated using numerical simulations of
statistical and dynamical models. We conclude that inhibitory tagging is a
viable mechanism for dynamical planning of scanpaths.
