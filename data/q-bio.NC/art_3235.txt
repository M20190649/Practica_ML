Timing Control of Single Neuron Spikes with Optogenetic Stimulation
This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method
to track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The
external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by a constant
current source that can be turned on or off. This paper considers a firing
frequency that is sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to its
resting potential after it fires. The time required for the neuron to charge
and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential are fitted to functions
of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters. Results show that linear functions
of the model parameters can be used to predict the charging times with some
accuracy and are sufficient to estimate the highest firing frequency achievable
without interspike interference.
