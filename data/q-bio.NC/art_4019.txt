Coherent states of the Euclidean group and activation regions of primary
  visual cortex
The uncertainty principle of SE(2) allows to construct a coherent states
transform that is strictly related to the Bargmann transform for the second
Heisenberg group H2. The corresponding target space is characterized
constructively and related to the almost complex structure of SE(2) as a
contact manifold. Such a coherent state transform provides a model for neural
activity maps in the primary visual cortex, that are then described in terms of
minimal uncertainty states. The results of the model are compared with the
experimental measurements.
