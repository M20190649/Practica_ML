Applying Quantum Principles to Psychology
This article starts out with a detailed example illustrating the utility of
applying quantum probability to psychology. Then it describes several
alternative mathematical methods for mapping fundamental quantum concepts (such
as state preparation, measurement, state evolution) to fundamental
psychological concepts (such as stimulus, response, information processing).
For state preparation, we consider both pure states and densities with
mixtures. For measurement, we consider projective measurements and positive
operator valued measurements. The advantages and disadvantages of each method
with respect to applications in psychology are discussed.
