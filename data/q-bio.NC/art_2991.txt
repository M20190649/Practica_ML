Synchronised firing patterns in a random network of adaptive exponential
  integrate-and-fire
We have studied neuronal synchronisation in a random network of adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. We study how spiking or bursting
synchronous behaviour appears as a function of the coupling strength and the
probability of connections, by constructing parameter spaces that identify
these synchronous behaviours from measurements of the inter-spike interval and
the calculation of the order parameter. Moreover, we verify the robustness of
synchronisaton by applying an external perturbation to each neuron. The
simulations show that bursting synchronisation is more robust than spike
synchronisation.
