Spatiotemporal dynamics and reliable computations in recurrent spiking
  neural networks
Randomly connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons
provide a parsimonious model of neural variability, but are notoriously
unreliable for performing computations. We show that this difficulty is
overcome by incorporating the well-documented dependence of connection
probability on distance. Spatially extended spiking networks exhibit
symmetry-breaking bifurcations and generate spatiotemporal patterns that can be
trained to perform dynamical computations.
