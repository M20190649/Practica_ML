Measuring directed interactions using cellular neural networks with
  complex connection topologies
We advance our approach of analyzing the dynamics of interacting complex
systems with the nonlinear dynamics of interacting nonlinear elements. We
replace the widely used lattice-like connection topology of cellular neural
networks (CNN) by complex topologies that include both short- and long-ranged
connections. With an exemplary time-resolved analysis of asymmetric nonlinear
interdependences between the seizure generating area and its immediate
surrounding we provide first evidence for complex CNN connection topologies to
allow for a faster network optimization together with an improved approximation
accuracy of directed interactions.
