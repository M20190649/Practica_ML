Spontaneous formation of synchronization clusters in homogenous neuronal
  ensembles induced by noise and interaction delays
Spontaneous formation of clusters of synchronized spiking in a structureless
ensemble of equal stochastically perturbed excitable neurons with delayed
coupling is demonstrated for the first time. The effect is a consequence of a
subtle interplay between interaction delays, noise and the excitable character
of a single neuron. Dependence of the cluster properties on the time-lag, noise
intensity and the synaptic strength is investigated.
