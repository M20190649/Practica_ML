Afferent Fiber Activity-Induced Cytoplasmic Calcium Signaling in
  Parvalbumin-Positive Inhibitory Interneurons of the Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn
Neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling represents a molecular trigger for diverse
central nervous system adaptations and maladaptions. The altered function of
dorsal spinal inhibitory interneurons is strongly implicated in the mechanisms
underlying central sensitization in chronic pain. Surprisingly little is known,
however, about the characteristics and consequences of Ca2+ signaling in these
cells, including whether and how they are changed following a peripheral insult
or injury and how such alterations might influence maladaptive pain plasticity.
As a first step towards clarifying the precise role of Ca2+ signaling in dorsal
spinal inhibitory neurons for central sensitization, we established methods for
characterizing Ca2+ signals in genetically defined populations of these cells.
In particular, we employed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to
deliver subcellularly targeted, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators into
parvalbumin-positive spinal inhibitory neurons. Using wide-field microscopy, we
observed both spontaneous and afferent fiber activity triggered Ca2+ signals in
these cells. We propose that these methods may be adapted in future studies for
the precise characterization and manipulation of Ca2+ signaling in diverse
spinal inhibitory neuron subtypes, thereby enabling the clarification of its
role in the mechanisms underlying pain chronicity and opening the door for
possibly novel treatment directions.
