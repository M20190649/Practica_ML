The effects of cyclical simulation on the axon hillock diameter of
  murine intracortical neurons
Changes to the axon hillock in frequently firing neurons are known to be
important predictors of early disease states. Studying this phenomenon is
critical to understanding the first insult implicated in multiple
neuro-degenerative disorders. To study these changes we used cyclical
stimulations using micro-electrodes to the axon hillock of mouse intracortical
neurons. Numerical simulation results indicate that axon hillock water
potential fluctuated sinusoidally on high voltage only. Fluctuations in the
amplitude and trend were caused by calcium flow and storage resistance,
respectively. The change in axon hillock-stored water was proportional to the
change rate in water potential. Axon hillock diameter increased with
fluctuations in calcium free media; moreover, it varied slightly under low
voltage conditions. Changes in axon hillock diameter were caused by changes in
water potential, which was determined by subcellular gated channels, media
calcium potential, and other baseline characteristics of neurons.
