Estimating effective connectivity in linear brain network models
Contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science to study the complex
and self-organized structure of the human brain; one of the main outstanding
issues is that of inferring from measure data, chiefly functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the so-called effective connectivity in brain
networks, that is the existing interactions among neuronal populations. This
inverse problem is complicated by the fact that the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation
Level Dependent) signal measured by fMRI represent a dynamic and nonlinear
transformation (the hemodynamic response) of neuronal activity. In this paper,
we consider resting state (rs) fMRI data; building upon a linear population
model of the BOLD signal and a stochastic linear DCM model, the model
parameters are estimated through an EM-type iterative procedure, which
alternately estimates the neuronal activity by means of the Rauch-Tung-Striebel
(RTS) smoother, updates the connections among neuronal states and refines the
parameters of the hemodynamic model; sparsity in the interconnection structure
is favoured using an iteratively reweighting scheme. Experimental results using
rs-fMRI data are shown demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and
comparison with state of the art routines (SPM12 toolbox) is provided.
