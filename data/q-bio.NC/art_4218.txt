Emergence of small-world anatomical networks in self-organizing
  clustered neuronal cultures
In vitro primary cultures of dissociated invertebrate neurons from locust
ganglia are used to experimentally investigate the morphological evolution of
assemblies of living neurons, as they self-organize from collections of
separated cells into elaborated, clustered, networks. At all the different
stages of the culture's development, identification of neurons' and neurites'
location by means of a dedicated software allows to ultimately extract an
adjacency matrix from each image of the culture. In turn, a systematic
statistical analysis of a group of topological observables grants us the
possibility of quantifying and tracking the progression of the main network's
characteristics during the self-organization process of the culture. Our
results point to the existence of a particular state corresponding to a
small-world network configuration, in which several relevant graph's micro- and
meso-scale properties emerge. Finally, we identify the main physical processes
ruling the culture's morphological transformations, and embed them into a
simplified growth model qualitatively reproducing the overall set of
experimental observations.
