Applications of Information Theory to Analysis of Neural Data
Information theory is a practical and theoretical framework developed for the
study of communication over noisy channels. Its probabilistic basis and
capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for
studying information flow in the nervous system. It has a number of useful
properties: it is a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only
linear effects; it has meaningful units which in many cases allow direct
comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much
information can be gained by observing neural responses in single trials,
rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information
theoretic quantities are commonly used in neuroscience - (see entry
"Definitions of Information-Theoretic Quantities"). In this entry we review
some applications of information theory in neuroscience to study encoding of
information in both single neurons and neuronal populations.
