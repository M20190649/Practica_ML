Extracellular-to-intracellular signal transfer via G-proteins
We look at the problem of signal transduction by extracellular agonist
binding to a receptor protein at the membrane (sensor) via binding of
G-proteins (effectors) to a highly integrative target molecule, such as the
second messenger cAMP (target). We explore the effects of binding times,
effector assignment and effector pool size on the shape of the output signal
under different input scenarios. We conclude that low rates of information
transfer may sometimes coincide with a high probability or efficiency of
plasticity induction.
