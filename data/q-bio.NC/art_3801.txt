Growth-Driven Percolations: The Dynamics of Community Formation in
  Neuronal Systems
The quintessential property of neuronal systems is their intensive patterns
of selective synaptic connections. The current work describes a physics-based
approach to neuronal shape modeling and synthesis and its consideration for the
simulation of neuronal development and the formation of neuronal communities.
Starting from images of real neurons, geometrical measurements are obtained and
used to construct probabilistic models which can be subsequently sampled in
order to produce morphologically realistic neuronal cells. Such cells are
progressively grown while monitoring their connections along time, which are
analysed in terms of percolation concepts. However, unlike traditional
percolation, the critical point is verified along the growth stages, not the
density of cells, which remains constant throughout the neuronal growth
dynamics. It is shown, through simulations, that growing beta cells tend to
reach percolation sooner than the alpha counterparts with the same diameter.
Also, the percolation becomes more abrupt for higher densities of cells, being
markedly sharper for the beta cells.
