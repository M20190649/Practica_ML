Monotonic Gaussian Process for Spatio-Temporal Disease Progression
  Modeling in Brain Imaging Data
We introduce a probabilistic generative model for disentangling
spatio-temporal disease trajectories from series of high-dimensional brain
images. The model is based on spatio-temporal matrix factorization, where
inference on the sources is constrained by anatomically plausible statistical
priors. To model realistic trajectories, the temporal sources are defined as
monotonic and time-reparametrized Gaussian Processes. To account for the
non-stationarity of brain images, we model the spatial sources as sparse codes
convolved at multiple scales. The method was tested on synthetic data
favourably comparing with standard blind source separation approaches. The
application on large-scale imaging data from a clinical study allows to
disentangle differential temporal progression patterns mapping brain regions
key to neurodegeneration, while revealing a disease-specific time scale
associated to the clinical diagnosis.
