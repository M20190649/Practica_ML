Early deafness leads to re-shaping of global functional connectivity
  beyond the auditory cortex
Early sensory deprivation such as blindness or deafness shapes brain
development in multiple ways. While it is established that deprived brain areas
start to be engaged in the processing of stimuli from the remaining modalities
and in high-level cognitive tasks, some reports have also suggested the
possibility of structural and functional changes in non-deprived brain areas.
We compared resting-state functional network organization of the brain in
early-deaf adults and hearing controls by examining global network segregation
and integration. Relative to hearing controls, deaf adults exhibited an altered
modular organization, with regions of the salience network coupled with the
fronto-parietal network. They showed weaker connections between auditory and
somatomotor regions, stronger coupling between the fronto-parietal network and
several other large-scale networks (visual, memory, cingulo-opercular and
somatomotor), and an enlargement of the default mode network. Their overall
functional segregation of brain networks was also lower. Our findings suggest
that brain plasticity in deaf adults is not limited to changes in auditory
cortex but additionally alters the coupling between other large-scale networks.
These widespread functional connectivity changes may provide a mechanism for
the superior behavioral performance of the deaf in visual and attentional
tasks.
