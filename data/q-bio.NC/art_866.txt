Differential response of the retinal neural code with respect to the
  sparseness of natural images
Natural images follow statistics inherited by the structure of our physical
(visual) environment. In particular, a prominent facet of this structure is
that images can be described by a relatively sparse number of features. To
investigate the role of this sparseness in the efficiency of the neural code,
we designed a new class of random textured stimuli with a controlled sparseness
value inspired by measurements of natural images. Then, we tested the impact of
this sparseness parameter on the firing pattern observed in a population of
retinal ganglion cells recorded ex vivo in the retina of a rodent, the Octodon
degus. These recordings showed in particular that the reliability of spike
timings varies with respect to the sparseness with globally a similar trend
than the distribution of sparseness statistics observed in natural images.
These results suggest that the code represented in the spike pattern of
ganglion cells may adapt to this aspect of the statistics of natural images.
