Blindfold learning of an accurate neural metric
The brain has no direct access to physical stimuli, but only to the spiking
activity evoked in sensory organs. It is unclear how the brain can structure
its representation of the world based on differences between those noisy,
correlated responses alone. Here we show how to build a distance map of
responses from the structure of the population activity of retinal ganglion
cells, allowing for the accurate discrimination of distinct visual stimuli from
the retinal response. We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to
learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this
model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric
outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that
are barely distinguishable. The proposed method provides a generic and
biologically plausible way to learn to associate similar stimuli based on their
spiking responses, without any other knowledge of these stimuli.
