The Advantage is at the Ladies: Brain Size Bias-Compensated
  Graph-Theoretical Parameters are Also Better in Women's Connectomes
In our previous study we have shown that the female connectomes have
significantly better, deep graph-theoretical parameters, related to superior
"connectivity", than the connectome of the males. Since the average female
brain is smaller than the average male brain, one cannot rule out that the
significant advantages are due to the size- and not to the sex-differences in
the data. To filter out the possible brain-volume related artifacts, we have
chosen 36 small male and 36 large female brains such that all the brains in the
female set are larger than all the brains in the male set. For the sets, we
have computed the corresponding braingraphs and computed numerous
graph-theoretical parameters. We have found that (i) the small male brains lack
the better connectivity advantages shown in our previous study for female
brains in general; (ii) in numerous parameters, the connectomes computed from
the large-brain females, still have the significant, deep connectivity
advantages, demonstrated in our previous study.
