Modulation and Robustness of Endogenous Neuronal Spiking
Neuronal spiking exhibits an exquisite combination of modulation and
robustness properties, rarely matched in artificial systems. We exploit the
particular interconnection structure of conductance based models to investigate
this remarkable property. We find that much of neuronal modulation and
robustness can be explained by separating the total transmembrane current into
three different components corresponding to the three time scales of neuronal
bursting. Each equivalent current aggregates many ionic contributions into an
equivalent voltage-dependent conductance, which defines a key modulation
parameter. Plugging those equivalent feedback gains in a minimal abstract model
recovers many experimental modulation scenarii as modulatory paths in
elementary two-parameter charts. Likewise, robustness owes to the many possible
physiological realizations of a same equivalent conductance, highlighting the
role of equivalent conductances as prominent targets for neuromodulation and
intrinsic homeostasis.
