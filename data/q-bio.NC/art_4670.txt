Emergent stochastic oscillations and signal detection in tree networks
  of excitable elements
We study the stochastic dynamics of strongly-coupled excitable elements on a
tree network. The peripheral nodes receive independent random inputs which may
induce large spiking events propagating through the branches of the tree and
leading to global coherent oscillations in the network. This scenario may be
relevant to action potential generation in certain sensory neurons, which
possess myelinated distal dendritic tree-like arbors with excitable nodes of
Ranvier at peripheral and branching nodes and exhibit noisy periodic sequences
of action potentials.
  We focus on the spiking statistics of the central node, which fires in
response to a noisy input at peripheral nodes. We show that, in the strong
coupling regime, relevant to myelinated dendritic trees, the spike train
statistics can be predicted from an isolated excitable element with rescaled
parameters according to the network topology. Furthermore, we show that by
varying the network topology the spike train statistics of the central node can
be tuned to have a certain firing rate and variability, or to allow for an
optimal discrimination of inputs applied at the peripheral nodes.
