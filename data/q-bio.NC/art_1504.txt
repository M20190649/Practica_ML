Extended temporal association memory by inhibitory Hebbian learning
Hebbian learning of excitatory synapses plays a central role in storing
activity patterns in associative memory models. Furthermore, interstimulus
Hebbian learning associates multiple items in the brain by converting temporal
correlation to spatial correlation between attractors. However, growing
experimental evidence suggests that learning of inhibitory synapses creates
"inhibitory engrams", which presumably balance with the patterns encoded in the
excitatory network. Controlling inhibitory engrams may modify the behavior of
associative memory in neural networks, but the consequence of such control has
not been theoretically understood. Noting that Hebbian learning of inhibitory
synapses yields an anti-Hebbian effect, we show that the combination of Hebbian
and anti-Hebbian learning can increase the span of temporal association between
the correlated attractors. The balance of targetted and global inhibition
regulates this span of association in the network. Our results suggest a
nontrivial role of anti-Hebbian learning and inhibitory engrams in associative
memory.
