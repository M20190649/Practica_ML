Quantum Probabilities as Behavioral Probabilities
We demonstrate that behavioral probabilities of human decision makers share
many common features with quantum probabilities. This does not imply that
humans are some quantum objects, but just shows that the mathematics of quantum
theory is applicable to the description of human decision making. The
applicability of quantum rules for describing decision making is connected with
the nontrivial process of making decisions in the case of composite prospects
under uncertainty. Such a process involves deliberations of a decision maker
when making a choice. In addition to the evaluation of the utilities of
considered prospects, real decision makers also appreciate their respective
attractiveness. Therefore, human choice is not based solely on the utility of
prospects, but includes the necessity of resolving the utility-attraction
duality. In order to justify that human consciousness really functions
similarly to the rules of quantum theory, we develop an approach defining human
behavioral probabilities as the probabilities determined by quantum rules. We
show that quantum behavioral probabilities of humans not merely explain
qualitatively how human decisions are made, but they predict quantitative
values of the behavioral probabilities. Analyzing a large set of empirical
data, we find good quantitative agreement between theoretical predictions and
observed experimental data.
