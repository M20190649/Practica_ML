A Theory of Decision Making Based on Feynman's Path Integral Formulation
  of Quantum Mechanics
Similarities between the non-deterministic nature of quantum theory and the
unpredictable patterns of human cognition and decision making have been
observed and commented on many times since the invention of Quantum Mechanics
in the first part of the 20th century. Niels Bohr himself took note of the
parallels.[3] In fact, an entire field of study, Quantum Cognition, has been
borne from the study of this analogy. [3] However, many of the attempts to
model human behavior with quantum mechanics conflate the identity of a particle
with its own wavefunction, which is incorrect and invalidates the analogy. In
this paper, we seek to make explicit this error, make necessary corrections,
and then deepen the analogy. We do this by creating a Quantum Decision Theory
that directly parallels Richard Feynman's novel formulation of quantum
mechanics published in 1948 at Cornell University: Space-Time Approach to
Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics".
