What can the brain teach us about building artificial intelligence?
This paper is the preprint of an invited commentary on Lake et al's
Behavioral and Brain Sciences article titled "Building machines that learn and
think like people". Lake et al's paper offers a timely critique on the recent
accomplishments in artificial intelligence from the vantage point of human
intelligence, and provides insightful suggestions about research directions for
building more human-like intelligence. Since we agree with most of the points
raised in that paper, we will offer a few points that are complementary.
