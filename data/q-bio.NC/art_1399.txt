Commentary: Intentional Observer Effects on Quantum Randomness: A
  Bayesian Analysis Reveals Evidence Against Micro-Psychokinesis
The paper titled `Intentional Observer Effects on Quantum Randomness: A
Bayesian Analysis Reveals Evidence Against Micro-Psychokinesis', published in
Frontiers of Psychology in March 2018, reports on a mind-matter experiment with
the main result of strong evidence against Micro-Psychokinesis. Despite this
conclusion, the authors interpret the observed pattern in their data as
possible evidence for Micro-Psychokinesis, albeit of a different kind.
Suggesting a connection to some existing models, the authors put forward the
hypothesis that a higher frequency of slow data variations can be observed in
their experiment data than in a set of control data. This commentary analyses
this claim and concludes that the variation in the data motivating this
hypothesis would show up just by chance with a probability of p=0.328 under a
null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no evidence for the hypothesis of faster
data variations, and thus for this kind of suggested Micro-Psychokinesis in
this experiment.
