Quantum theory of time perception: phases,clocks and quantum algebra
Experience of time is one of the primordial human experiences which is deeply
tied to human consciousness. But despite this intimate relation of time with
human conscious experience, time has proved to be very elusive. Particularly in
physics, though there is already some understanding of time, there are still so
many paradoxes that plague this understanding. In this paper we take rather a
different route to question of time. We first attempt to come up with a
theoretical understanding of time perception. Quite interestingly we find that
quantum theory provides an algebraic formulation within which we can understand
some essential aspects of time perception by human mind. We then ask whether a
similar formalism can furnish the understanding of time as well and find
connections of our formulation of time with similar works by other researchers.
Our underlying approach to question of time has been inspired by R. W. Hamilton
who considers algebra as science of pure time. Hence our work has an extensive
algebraic flavor. Our work also incorporates another approach based on
Kauffman's iterant algebra which relates time to underlying recursions and
oscillations. We believe that our work will initiate more investigations in
this direction.
