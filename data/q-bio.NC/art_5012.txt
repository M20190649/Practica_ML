Real-time cortical simulations: energy and interconnect scaling on
  distributed systems
We profile the impact of computation and inter-processor communication on the
energy consumption and on the scaling of cortical simulations approaching the
real-time regime on distributed computing platforms. Also, the speed and energy
consumption of processor architectures typical of standard HPC and embedded
platforms are compared. We demonstrate the importance of the design of
low-latency interconnect for speed and energy consumption. The cost of cortical
simulations is quantified using the Joule per synaptic event metric on both
architectures. Reaching efficient real-time on large scale cortical simulations
is of increasing relevance for both future bio-inspired artificial intelligence
applications and for understanding the cognitive functions of the brain, a
scientific quest that will require to embed large scale simulations into highly
complex virtual or real worlds. This work stands at the crossroads between the
WaveScalES experiment in the Human Brain Project (HBP), which includes the
objective of large scale thalamo-cortical simulations of brain states and their
transitions, and the ExaNeSt and EuroExa projects, that investigate the design
of an ARM-based, low-power High Performance Computing (HPC) architecture with a
dedicated interconnect scalable to million of cores; simulation of deep sleep
Slow Wave Activity (SWA) and Asynchronous aWake (AW) regimes expressed by
thalamo-cortical models are among their benchmarks.
