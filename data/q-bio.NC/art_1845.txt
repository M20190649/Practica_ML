A neural mechanism for binaural pitch perception via ghost stochastic
  resonance
We present a physiologically plausible binaural mechanism for the perception
of the pitch of complex sounds via ghost stochastic resonance. In this scheme,
two neurons are driven by noise and different periodic signal each (with
frequencies f1=kf0 and f2=(k+1)f0, where k>1), and their outputs (plus noise)
are applied synaptically to a third neuron. Our numerical results, using the
Morris-Lecar neuron model with chemical synapses explicity considered, show
that intermediate noise levels enhance the response of the third neuron at
frequencies close to f0, as in the cases previously described of ghost
resonance. For the case of inharmonic combinations of inputs (both frequencies
shifted by the same amount Df) noise is also seen to enhance the response of
the third neuron at a frequency fr with also shift linearly with Df. In
addition, we show that similar resonances can be observed as a function of the
synaptic time constant. The suggested ghost-resonance-based stochastic
mechanism can thus arise either at the peripheral level or at a higher level of
neural processing in the perception of the pitch
