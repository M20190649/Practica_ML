Parameterizable Consensus Connectomes from the Human Connectome Project:
  The Budapest Reference Connectome Server v3.0
Connections of the living human brain, on a macroscopic scale, can be mapped
by a diffusion MR imaging based workflow. Since the same anatomic regions can
be corresponded between distinct brains, one can compare the presence or the
absence of the edges, connecting the very same two anatomic regions, among
multiple cortices. Previously, we have constructed the consensus braingraphs on
1015 vertices first in five, then in 96 subjects in the Budapest Reference
Connectome Server v1.0 and v2.0, respectively. Here we report the construction
of the version 3.0 of the server, generating the common edges of the
connectomes of variously parameterizable subsets of the 1015-vertex connectomes
of 477 subjects of the Human Connectome Project's 500-subject release. The
consensus connectomes are downloadable in csv and GraphML formats, and they are
also visualized on the server's page. The consensus connectomes of the server
can be considered as the "average, healthy" human connectome since all of their
connections are present in at least $k$ subjects, where the default value of
$k=209$, but it can also be modified freely at the web server. The webserver is
available at \url{http://connectome.pitgroup.org}.
