Modeling cognitive deficits following neurodegenerative diseases and
  traumatic brain injuries with deep convolutional neural networks
The accurate diagnosis and assessment of neurodegenerative disease and
traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remain open challenges. Both cause cognitive and
functional deficits due to focal axonal swellings (FAS), but it is difficult to
deliver a prognosis due to our limited ability to assess damaged neurons at a
cellular level in vivo. We simulate the effects of neurodegenerative disease
and TBI using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model of cognition.
We utilize biophysically relevant statistical data on FAS to damage the
connections in CNNs in a functionally relevant way. We incorporate energy
constraints on the brain by pruning the CNNs to be less over-engineered.
Qualitatively, we demonstrate that damage leads to human-like mistakes. Our
experiments also provide quantitative assessments of how accuracy is affected
by various types and levels of damage. The deficit resulting from a fixed
amount of damage greatly depends on which connections are randomly injured,
providing intuition for why it is difficult to predict impairments. There is a
large degree of subjectivity when it comes to interpreting cognitive deficits
from complex systems such as the human brain. However, we provide important
insight and a quantitative framework for disorders in which FAS are implicated.
