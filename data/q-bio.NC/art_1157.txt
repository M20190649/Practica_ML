Pupil size behavior during on line processing of sentences
In the present work we analyzed the pupil size behavior of forty subjects
while they read well defined sentences with different contextual predictability
(i.e., regular sentences and proverbs). In general, pupil size increased when
reading regular sentences, but when readers realized that they were reading
proverbs their pupils strongly increase until finishing proverbs' reading. Our
results suggest that an increased pupil size is not limited to cognitive load
(i.e., relative difficulty in processing) because when participants accurately
recognized words during reading proverbs, theirs pupil size increased too. Our
results show that pupil size dynamics may be a reliable measure to investigate
the cognitive processes involved in sentence processing and memory functioning.
