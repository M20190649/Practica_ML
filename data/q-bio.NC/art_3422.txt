Statistical Data Assimilation: Formulation and Examples from
  Neurobiology
For the Research Topic Data Assimilation and Control: Theory and Applications
in Life Sciences we first review the formulation of statistical data
assimilation (SDA) and discuss algorithms for exploring variational
approximations to the conditional expected values of biophysical aspects of
functional neural circuits. Then we report on the application of SDA to (1) the
exploration of properties of individual neurons in the HVC nucleus of the avian
song system, and (2) characterizing individual neurons formulated as very large
scale integration (VLSI) analog circuits with a goal of building functional,
biophysically realistic, VLSI representations of functional nervous systems.
Networks of neurons pose a substantially greater challenge, and we comment on
formulating experiments to probe the properties, especially the functional
connectivity, in song command circuits within HVC.
