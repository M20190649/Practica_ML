A new framework for Euclidean summary statistics in the neural spike
  train space
Statistical analysis and inference on spike trains is one of the central
topics in the neural coding. It is of great interest to understand the
underlying structure of given neural data. Based on the metric distances
between spike trains, recent investigations have introduced the notion of an
average or prototype spike train to characterize the template pattern in the
neural activity. However, as those metrics lack certain Euclidean properties,
the defined averages are nonunique, and do not share the conventional
properties of a mean. In this article, we propose a new framework to define the
mean spike train where we adopt a Euclidean-like metric from an $L^p$ family.
We demonstrate that this new mean spike train properly represents the average
pattern in the conventional fashion, and can be effectively computed using a
theoretically-proven convergent procedure. We compare this mean with other
spike train averages and demonstrate its superiority. Furthermore, we apply the
new framework in a recording from rodent geniculate ganglion, where background
firing activity is a common issue for neural coding. We show that the proposed
mean spike train can be utilized to remove the background noise and improve
decoding performance.
