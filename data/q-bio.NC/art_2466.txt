Frequency adjustment and synchrony in networks of delayed pulse coupled
  oscillators
We introduce a system of pulse coupled oscillators that can change both their
phases and frequencies; and prove that when there is a separation of time
scales between phase and frequency adjustment the system converges to exact
synchrony on strongly connected graphs with time delays. The analysis involves
decomposing the network into a forest of tree-like structures that capture
causality. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound for the size of the basin of
attraction with immediate implications for empirical networks and random graph
models. These results provide a robust method of sensor net synchronization as
well as demonstrate a new avenue of possible pulse coupled oscillator research.
