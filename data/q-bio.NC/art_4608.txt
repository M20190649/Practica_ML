Quantum consciousness in warm, wet, and noisy brain
The emergence of quantum consciousness stems from dynamic flows of hydrogen
ions in brain liquid. This liquid contains vast areas of the fourth phase of
water with hexagonal packing of its molecules, the so-called exclusion zone
(EZ) of water. The hydrogen ion motion on such hexagonal lattices shows as the
hopping of the ions forward and the holes (vacant places) backward, caused by
the Grotthuss mechanism. By supporting this motion using external infrasound
sources, one may achieve the appearance of the superfluid state of the EZ
water. Flows of the hydrogen ions are described by the modified Navier-Stokes
equation. It, along with the continuity equation, yields the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, which describes the quantum effects of these flows, such
as the tunneling at long distances or the interference on gap junctions.
