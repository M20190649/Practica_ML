Unconscious lie detection as an example of a widespread fallacy in the
  Neurosciences
Neuroscientists frequently use a certain statistical reasoning to establish
the existence of distinct neuronal processes in the brain. We show that this
reasoning is flawed and that the large corresponding literature needs
reconsideration. We illustrate the fallacy with a recent study that received an
enormous press coverage because it concluded that humans detect deceit better
if they use unconscious processes instead of conscious deliberations. The study
was published under a new open-data policy that enabled us to reanalyze the
data with more appropriate methods. We found that unconscious performance was
close to chance - just as the conscious performance. This illustrates the flaws
of this widely used statistical reasoning, the benefits of open-data practices,
and the need for careful reconsideration of studies using the same rationale.
