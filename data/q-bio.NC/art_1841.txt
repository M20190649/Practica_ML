Statistics of lines of natural images and implications for visual
  detection
As borders between different regions, lines are an important element of
natural images. Already at the level of the mammalian primary visual cortex
(V1), neurons respond best to lines of a given orientation. We reduce a set of
images to linear segments and analyze their statistical properties. In
particular, appropriately defined Fourier spectra show more power in their
transverse component than in the longitudinal one. We then characterize filters
that are best suited for extracting information from such images, and find some
qualitative consistency with neural connections in V1. We also demonstrate that
such filters are efficient in reconstructing missing lines in an image.
