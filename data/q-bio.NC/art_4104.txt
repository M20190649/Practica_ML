Natural electromagnetic waveguide structures based on myelin sheath in
  the neural system
The saltatory propagation of action potentials on myelinated axons is
conventionally explained by the mechanism employing local circuit ionic current
flows between nodes of Ranvier. Under this framework, the myelin sheath with up
to 100 layers of membrane only serves as the insulating shell. The speed of
action potentials is measured to be as fast as 100 m/s on myelinated axons, but
ions move in fluids at just 100 nm/s in a 1 V/m electric field. We show here
the action potentials, in the form of electromagnetic (EM) pulses, can
propagate in natural EM waveguide structures formed by the myelin sheath merged
in fluids. The propagation time is mainly cost on the duration for triggering
EM pulses at nodes of Ranvier. The result clearly reveals the evolution of
axons from the unmyelinated to the myelinated, which has remarkably enhanced
the propagation efficiency by increasing the thickness of myelin sheath.
