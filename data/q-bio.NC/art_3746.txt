Towards Modeling of Consciousness
An approach to nonlinear dynamical modeling of interaction between conscious
and automatic processes in the brain is proposed. Illustration of this approach
on the nonlinear equation for the current density in the cortex is presented.
Nonlinearity is determined by the sigmoidal firing rate of neurons. The current
density is considered as complex field with real and imaginary parts
representing automatic and conscious processes. The interaction is due to the
nonlinearity of the system. From this approach it follows that the nonlinear
dynamics for pure imaginary process (a dream) is quite different from the
dynamics of automatic process.
