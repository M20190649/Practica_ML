Developmental increases in white matter network controllability support
  a growing diversity of brain dynamics
As the human brain develops, it increasingly supports coordinated control of
neural activity. The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this
coordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of
diffusion imaging data from 882 youth ages 8 to 22 to show that white matter
connectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted
dynamics in development. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are
negatively related to cognitive performance. Investigating structural
mechanisms supporting these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set
of growth rules. We find that all brain networks are structured in a manner
highly optimized for network control, with distinct control mechanisms
predicted in child versus older youth. We demonstrate that our results cannot
be simply explained by changes in network modularity. This work reveals a
possible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes
dynamic network control over static network architecture.
