Arbor -- a morphologically-detailed neural network simulation library
  for contemporary high-performance computing architectures
We introduce Arbor, a performance portable library for simulation of large
networks of multi-compartment neurons on HPC systems. Arbor is open source
software, developed under the auspices of the HBP. The performance portability
is by virtue of back-end specific optimizations for x86 multicore, Intel KNL,
and NVIDIA GPUs. When coupled with low memory overheads, these optimizations
make Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable
simulation software. The single-node performance can be scaled out to run very
large models at extreme scale with efficient weak scaling.
