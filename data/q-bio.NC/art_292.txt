Photo-Thermal Neural Excitation by Extrinsic and Intrinsic Absorbers: A
  Temperature-Rate Model
Infrared neural stimulation (INS) pulses at water-absorbed mid-IR wavelengths
could provide a non-invasive and safe modality for stimulating peripheral and
cranial nerves and central nervous system neurons. The excitation mechanism
underlying INS activation is thought to be mediated by photo-thermal tissue
transients, which can also potentially be induced using extrinsic absorbers
(Photo-Absorber Induced Neural-Thermal Stimulation or PAINTS). The specific
biophysical effect of photo-thermal transients on target neurons has yet to be
determined and quantitatively characterized. Here, we propose and study a model
for thermally-induced neural stimulation where temperature changes induce a
depolarizing transmembrane current proportional to the temperature rate of
change. Our model includes physical calculations of the temperature transients
induced by laser absorption and a biophysical model of the target cells. Our
results indicate that stimulation thresholds predicted by the model are in good
agreement with empirical data obtained in cortical cell cultures using
extrinsic micro-particle absorbers (PAINTS) as well as with earlier results on
auditory neuron stimulation using INS. These results suggest a general
empirical-law for photo-thermal interactions with neural systems, and could
help direct future basic and applied studies of these phenomena.
