Mimicking Collective Firing Patterns of Hundreds of Connected Neurons
  using a Single-Neuron Experiment
The experimental study of neural networks requires simultaneous measurements
of a massive number of neurons, while monitoring properties of the
connectivity, synaptic strengths and delays. Current technological barriers
make such a mission unachievable. In addition, as a result of the enormous
number of required measurements, the estimated network parameters would differ
from the original ones. Here we present a versatile experimental technique,
which enables the study of recurrent neural networks activity while being
capable of dictating the network connectivity and synaptic strengths. This
method is based on the observation that the response of neurons depends solely
on their recent stimulations, a short-term memory. It allows a long-term scheme
of stimulation and recording of a single neuron, to mimic simultaneous activity
measurements of neurons in a recurrent network. Utilization of this technique
demonstrates the spontaneous emergence of cooperative synchronous oscillations,
in particular the coexistence of fast Gamma and slow Delta oscillations, and
opens the horizon for the experimental study of other cooperative phenomena
within large-scale neural networks.
