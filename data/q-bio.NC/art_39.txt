Activity-dependent brain model explaining EEG spectra
Most brain models focus on associative memory or calculation capability,
experimentally inaccessible using physiological methods. Here we present a
model explaining a basic feature of electroencephalograms (EEG). Our model is
based on an electrical network with threshold firing and plasticity of synapses
that reproduces very robustly the measured exponent 0.8 of the medical EEG
spectra, a solid evidence for self-organized criticality. Our result are also
valid on small-world lattices. We propose that an universal scaling behaviour
characterizes many physiological signal spectra for brain controlled
activities.
