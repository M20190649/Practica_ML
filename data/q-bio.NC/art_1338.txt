Prognostication of chronic disorders of consciousness using brain
  functional networks and clinical characteristics
Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases
or injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for
prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false
prediction. This study aimed to develop a multidomain prognostic model that
combines resting state functional MRI with three clinical characteristics to
predict one year outcomes at the single-subject level. The model discriminated
between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not
with an accuracy of around 90% on three datasets from two medical centers. It
was also able to identify the prognostic importance of different predictors,
including brain functions and clinical characteristics. To our knowledge, this
is the first implementation reported of a multidomain prognostic model based on
resting state functional MRI and clinical characteristics in chronic disorders
of consciousness. We therefore suggest that this novel prognostic model is
accurate, robust, and interpretable.
