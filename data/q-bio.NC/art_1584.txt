Neural-network simulations of memory consolidation and reconsolidation
In the mammalian brain newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for
maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken over by the
neocortex through a process called systems consolidation. However, reactivation
of a consolidated memory can induce a brief period of temporary
hippocampus-dependence, followed by return to hippocampus-independence. Here we
present a computational model that uses simulation of recently described
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to account for findings from the systems
consolidation/reconsolidation literature and to make predictions for future
research.
