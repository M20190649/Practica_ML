Explaining versus Describing Human Decisions. Hilbert Space Structures
  in Decision Theory
Despite the impressive success of quantum structures to model long-standing
human judgement and decision puzzles, the {\it quantum cognition research
programme} still faces challenges about its explanatory power. Indeed, quantum
models introduce new parameters, which may fit empirical data without
necessarily explaining them. Also, one wonders whether more general
non-classical structures are better equipped to model cognitive phenomena. In
this paper, we provide a {\it realistic-operational foundation of decision
processes} using a known decision-making puzzle, the {\it Ellsberg paradox}, as
a case study. Then, we elaborate a novel representation of the Ellsberg
decision situation applying standard quantum correspondence rules which map
realistic-operational entities into quantum mathematical terms. This result
opens the way towards an independent, foundational rather than
phenomenological, motivation for a general use of quantum Hilbert space
structures in human cognition.
