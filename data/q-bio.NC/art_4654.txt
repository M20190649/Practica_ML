Universal power-law scaling of water diffusion in human brain defines
  what we see with MRI
Development of successful therapies for neurological disorders depends on our
ability to diagnose and monitor the progression of underlying pathologies at
the cellular level. Physics and physiology limit the resolution of human MRI to
millimeters, three orders of magnitude coarser than the cell dimensions of
microns. A promising way to access cellular structure is provided by
diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), a modality which exploits the sensitivity of the
MRI signal to micron-level Brownian motion of water molecules strongly hindered
by cell walls. By analyzing diffusion of water molecules in human subjects,
here we demonstrate that biophysical modeling has the potential to break the
intrinsic MRI resolution limits. The observation of a universal power-law
scaling of the dMRI signal identifies the contribution from water specifically
confined inside narrow impermeable axons, validating the overarching assumption
behind models of diffusion in neuronal tissue. This scaling behavior
establishes dMRI as an in vivo instrument able to quantify intra-axonal
properties orders of magnitude below the nominal MRI resolution, spurring our
understanding of brain anatomy and function.
