A detailed study of recurrent neural networks used to model tasks in the
  cerebral cortex
Recurrent Neural Networks or RNN are frequently used to model different
aspects of brain regions. We studied the properties of RNN trained to perform
temporal and flow control tasks with temporal stimuli. We present the results
regarding three aspects: inner configuration sets, memory capacity with the
scale and immunity to induced damage on trained networks. Our results allow us
to quantify different aspects of these physical models, which are normally used
as black boxes and must be understood previous to modeling the biological
response of cerebral cortex.
