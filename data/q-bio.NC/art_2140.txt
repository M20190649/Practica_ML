Nonlocal mechanism for cluster synchronization in neural circuits
The interplay between the topology of cortical circuits and synchronized
activity modes in distinct cortical areas is a key enigma in neuroscience. We
present a new nonlocal mechanism governing the periodic activity mode: the
greatest common divisor (GCD) of network loops. For a stimulus to one node, the
network splits into GCD-clusters in which cluster neurons are in zero-lag
synchronization. For complex external stimuli, the number of clusters can be
any common divisor. The synchronized mode and the transients to synchronization
pinpoint the type of external stimuli. The findings, supported by an
information mixing argument and simulations of Hodgkin Huxley population
dynamic networks with unidirectional connectivity and synaptic noise, call for
reexamining sources of correlated activity in cortex and shorter information
processing time scales.
