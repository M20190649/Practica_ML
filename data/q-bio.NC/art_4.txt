Measuring the dynamics of neural responses in primary auditory cortex
We review recent developments in the measurement of the dynamics of the
response properties of auditory cortical neurons to broadband sounds, which is
closely related to the perception of timbre. The emphasis is on a method that
characterizes the spectro-temporal properties of single neurons to dynamic,
broadband sounds, akin to the drifting gratings used in vision. The method
treats the spectral and temporal aspects of the response on an equal footing.
