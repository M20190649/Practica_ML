Coincidences with the Artificial Axon
The artificial axon is an excitable node built with the basic biomolecular
components and supporting action potentials. Here we demonstrate coincidence
firing (the AND operation) and other basic electrophysiology features such as
increasing firing rates for increasing input currents. We construct the basic
unit for a network by connecting two such excitable nodes through an electronic
synapse, producing pre/post synaptic behavior in which one axon induces firing
in another. We show that the system is well described by the Hodgkin-Huxley
model of nerve excitability, and conclude with a brief outlook for realizing
large networks of such low voltage "ionics".
