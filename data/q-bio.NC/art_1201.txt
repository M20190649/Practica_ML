Introduction: Toward an interdisciplinary science of spontaneous thought
Enormous questions still loom for the emerging science of spontaneous
thought: what, exactly, is spontaneous thought? Why does our brain engage in
spontaneous forms of thinking, and when is this most likely to occur? And
perhaps the question most interesting and accessible from a scientific
perspective: how does the brain generate, elaborate, and evaluate its own
spontaneous creations? The central aim of this volume is to bring together
views from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, phenomenology, history,
education, contemplative traditions, and clinical practice in order to begin to
address the ubiquitous but poorly understood mental phenomena that we
collectively call 'spontaneous thought.' Perhaps no other mental experience is
so familiar to us in daily life, and yet so difficult to understand and explain
scientifically. The present volume represents the first effort to bring such
highly diverse perspectives to bear on answering the what, when, why, and how
of spontaneous thought.
