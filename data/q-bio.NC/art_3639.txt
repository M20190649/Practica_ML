Increasing signal amplitude in electrical impedance tomography of neural
  activity using a parallel resistor inductor capacitor (RLC) circuit
Objective: To increase the impedance signal amplitude produced during neural
activity using a novel approach of implementing a parallel resistor inductor
capacitor (RLC) circuit across the current source used in electrical impedance
tomography (EIT) of peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed in
vitro on sciatic nerve of Sprague-Dawley rats. Design of the RLC circuit was
performed in electrical circuit modelling software, aided by in vitro impedance
measurements on nerve and nerve cuff in the range 5 Hz to 50 kHz. Main results:
The frequency range 17 +/- 1 kHz was selected for the RLC experiment. The RLC
experiment was performed on four subjects using an RLC circuit designed to
produce a resonant frequency of 17 kHz with a bandwidth of 3.6 kHz, and
containing a 22 mH inductive element and a 3.45 nF capacitive element. With the
RLC circuit connected, relative increases in the impedance signal (+/- 3sig
noise) of 44 % (+/-15 %), 33 % (+/-30 %), 37 % (+/-8.6 %), and 16 % (+/-19 %)
were produced. Significance: The increase in impedance signal amplitude at high
frequencies, generated by the novel implementation of a parallel RLC circuit
across the drive current, improves spatial resolution by increasing the number
of parallel drive currents which can be implemented in a frequency division
multiplexed (FDM) EIT system, and aids the long term goal of a real-time FDM
EIT system by reducing the need for ensemble averaging.
