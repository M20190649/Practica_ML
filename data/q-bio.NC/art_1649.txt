Improved visual function in a case of ultra-low vision following
  ischemic encephalopathy following transcranial electrical stimulation; A case
  study
Cortical visual impairment is amongst the key pathological causes of
pediatric visual abnormalities predominantly resulting from hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury. Such an injury results in profound visual impairments which
severely impairs the patient's quality of life. Given the nature of the
pathology, treatments are mostly limited to rehabilitation strategies such as
transcranial electrical stimulation and visual rehabilitation therapy. Here, we
discussed an 11 year-old girl case with cortical visual impairment who
underwent concurrent visual rehabilitation therapy and transcranial electrical
stimulation resulting in her improved visual function. This novel and
noninvasive therapeutic intervention has shown potential for application in
neuro-visual rehabilitation therapy (nVRT).
