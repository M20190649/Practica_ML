Some Theoretical Investigations in EEG Studies
It is well known that Electroencephalography(EEG) and the respective evoked
potentials have deep implications corresponding to specific cognitive tasks and
in the diagnosis of several diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Some
recent experimental results have already shown some evidence of chaotic
activity in the brain. The Hodgekin-Huxley(HH) models, may yield geometrical
solutions in terms of limit cycles and basins of attractors, but its
implementation requires a priori knowledge of the kinetics of the innumerable
conductances acting in a given set of cells. We are of the opinion that the EEG
data should reflect the neuronal dynamics, and there should be some mechanism
at the neuronal level which generates stochasticity compatible with the
recorded data. In this paper we develop a theoretical framework to show that
EEG dynamics may be governed by a suitably biased Vander-Pol oscillator which
is closely related with the modified version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo(FN) model
making extension of the ideas of dynamic causal modelling (DCM). Eventually we
also give a prescription to compute the correlation matrices which may be
tested empirically, for some small values of the parameters.
