Synaptic plasticity and neuronal refractory time cause scaling behaviour
  of neuronal avalanches
Neuronal avalanches measured in vitro and in vivo in different cortical
networks consistently exhibit power law behaviour for the size and duration
distributions with exponents typical for a mean field self-organized branching
process. These exponents are also recovered in neuronal network simulations
implementing various neuronal dynamics on different network topologies. They
can therefore be considered a very robust feature of spontaneous neuronal
activity. Interestingly, this scaling behaviour is also observed on regular
lattices in finite dimensions, which raises the question about the origin of
the mean field behaviour observed experimentally. In this study we provide an
answer to this open question by investigating the effect of activity dependent
plasticity in combination with the neuronal refractory time in a neuronal
network. Results show that the refractory time hinders backward avalanches
forcing a directed propagation. Hebbian plastic adaptation plays the role of
sculpting these directed avalanche patterns into the topology of the network
slowly changing it into a branched structure where loops are marginal.
