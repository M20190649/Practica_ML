Consciousness, cognition, and context: extending the global neuronal
  workspace model
We adapt an information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological
and social modules to the problem of the global neuronal workspace, the current
standard neuroscience picture of consciousness. Tunable punctuation emerges in
a natural manner, suggesting the possibility of fitting appropriate phase
transition power law, and, away from transition, generalized Onsager relation
expressions, to observational data on conscious reaction. The development can
be extended in a straightforward way to include the role of psychosocial
stress, culture, or other embedding structured contexts in individual
consciousness, producing a 'biopsychosocial' model that closely retains the
flavor of the standard treatment, but better meets philosophical and other
objections to brain-only descriptions.
