Quantum-like model of behavioral response computation using neural
  oscillators
In this paper we propose the use of neural interference as the origin of
quantum-like effects in the brain. We do so by using a neural oscillator model
consistent with neurophysiological data. The model used was shown to reproduce
well the predictions of behavioral stimulus-response theory. The quantum-like
effects are obtained by the spreading activation of incompatible oscillators,
leading to an interference-like effect mediated by inhibitory and excitatory
synapses.
