Thermodynamic Model of Criticality in the Cortex Based On EEG/ECOG Data
Criticality in the cortex emerges from the seemingly random interaction of
microscopic components and produces higher cognitive functions at mesoscopic
and macroscopic scales. Random graphs and percolation theory provide natural
means to de- scribe critical regions in the behavior of the cortex and they are
proposed here as novel mathematical tools helping us deciphering the language
of the brain.
