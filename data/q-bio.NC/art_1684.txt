The scientific case for brain simulations
A key element of the European Union's Human Brain Project (HBP) and other
large-scale brain research projects is simulation of large-scale model networks
of neurons. Here we argue why such simulations will likely be indispensable for
bridging the scales between the neuron and system levels in the brain, and a
set of brain simulators based on neuron models at different levels of
biological detail should thus be developed. To allow for systematic refinement
of candidate network models by comparison with experiments, the simulations
should be multimodal in the sense that they should not only predict action
potentials, but also electric, magnetic, and optical signals measured at the
population and system levels.
