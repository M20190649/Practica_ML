Stable fixed points of combinatorial threshold-linear networks
Combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) are a special class of neural
networks whose dynamics are tightly controlled by an underlying directed graph.
In prior work, we showed that target-free cliques of the graph correspond to
stable fixed points of the dynamics, and we conjectured that these are the only
stable fixed points allowed. In this paper we prove that the conjecture holds
in a variety of special cases, including for graphs with very strong inhibition
and graphs of size $n \leq 4$. We also provide further evidence for the
conjecture by showing that sparse graphs and graphs that are nearly cliques can
never support stable fixed points. Finally, we translate some results from
extremal combinatorics to upper bound the number of stable fixed points of
CTLNs in cases where the conjecture holds.
