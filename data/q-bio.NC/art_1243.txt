A probabilistic model for learning in cortical microcircuit motifs with
  data-based divisive inhibition
Previous theoretical studies on the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons proposed to model this cortical microcircuit motif as a so-called
Winner-Take-All (WTA) circuit. A recent modeling study however found that the
WTA model is not adequate for data-based softer forms of divisive inhibition as
found in a microcircuit motif in cortical layer 2/3. We investigate here
through theoretical analysis the role of such softer divisive inhibition for
the emergence of computational operations and neural codes under spike-timing
dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that in contrast to WTA models - where the
network activity has been interpreted as probabilistic inference in a
generative mixture distribution - this network dynamics approximates inference
in a noisy-OR-like generative model that explains the network input based on
multiple hidden causes. Furthermore, we show that STDP optimizes the parameters
of this model by approximating online the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. This theoretical analysis corroborates a preceding modelling study
which suggested that the learning dynamics of this layer 2/3 microcircuit motif
extracts a specific modular representation of the input and thus performs blind
source separation on the input statistics.
