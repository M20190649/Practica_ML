Probabilistic Inference of Binary Markov Random Fields in Spiking Neural
  Networks through Mean-field Approximation
Recent studies have suggested that the cognitive process of the human brain
is realized as probabilistic inference and can be further modeled by
probabilistic graphical models like Markov random fields. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how probabilistic inference can be implemented by a network of
spiking neurons in the brain. Previous studies tried to relate the inference
equation of binary Markov random fields to the dynamic equation of spiking
neural networks through belief propagation algorithm and reparameterization,
but they are valid only for Markov random fields with limited network
structure. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network model that can
implement inference of arbitrary binary Markov random fields. Specifically, we
design a spiking recurrent neural network and prove that its neuronal dynamics
are mathematically equivalent to the inference process of Markov random fields
by adopting mean-field theory. Theoretical analysis and experimental results,
