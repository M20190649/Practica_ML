Spin and Wind Directions II: A Bell State Quantum Model
In the first half of this two-part article, we analyzed a cognitive
psychology experiment where participants were asked to select pairs of
directions that they considered to be the best example of 'Two Different Wind
Directions', and showed that the data violate the CHSH version of Bell's
inequality, with same magnitude as in typical Bell-test experiments in physics.
In this second part, we complete our analysis by presenting a symmetrized
version of the experiment, still violating the CHSH inequality but now also
obeying the marginal law, for which we provide a full quantum modeling in
Hilbert space, using a singlet state and suitably chosen product measurements.
We also address some of the criticisms that have been recently directed at
experiments of this kind, according to which they would not highlight the
presence of genuine forms of entanglement. We explain that these criticisms are
based on a view of entanglement that is too restrictive, thus unable to capture
all possible ways physical and conceptual entities can connect and form systems
behaving as a whole. We also provide an example of a mechanical model showing
that the violations of the marginal law and Bell inequalities are generally to
be associated with different mechanisms.
