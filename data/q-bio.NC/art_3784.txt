Steady-state visual evoked potentials and phase synchronization in
  migraine
We investigate phase synchronization in EEG recordings from migraine
patients. We use the analytic signal technique, based on the Hilbert transform,
and find that migraine brains are characterized by enhanced alpha band phase
synchronization in presence of visual stimuli. Our findings show that migraine
patients have an overactive regulatory mechanism that renders them more
sensitive to external stimuli.
