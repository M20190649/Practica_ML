Imaging electrical activity of neurons with metamaterial nanosensors
A technology for recording electrical activity of large neuron populations at
arbitrary depth in brain tissues with less than cell spatial and millisecond
temporal resolutions was the most craving dream of neuroscientists and a long
pursued goal of engineers for decades. Even though many imaging techniques have
been devised up to date, none of them is capable to deliver either
quantitatively valid data nor able to meet contradictory requirements posed for
sensors to be safe, non-invasive and reliably working either within cultured
cell populations or during chronic implantations in vivo. In my research
project, I design and justify a novel nanobiosensors, capable to detect and
optically report the electric fields across cellular membrane and investigate
properties of that specially engineered plasmonic nanoantennas. In the
following literature survey, I observe the current state of electrophysiology
methods and after recalling the basics of fluorescence, discuss benefits and
drawbacks of today's voltage sensitive labelling and electric fields imaging
methods. This review is wrapped up by a brief outlook of prospective
applications of this technology.
