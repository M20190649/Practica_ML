ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge 2019: Predicting individual
  fluid intelligence scores from structural MRI using probabilistic
  segmentation and kernel ridge regression
We applied several regression and deep learning methods to predict fluid
intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI scans as part of the ABCD
Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge (ABCD-NP-Challenge) 2019. We used voxel
intensities and probabilistic tissue-type labels derived from these as features
to train the models. The best predictive performance (lowest mean-squared
error) came from Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR; $\lambda=10$), which produced a
mean-squared error of 69.7204 on the validation set and 92.1298 on the test
set. This placed our group in the fifth position on the validation leader board
and first place on the final (test) leader board.
