Investigating complex networks with inverse models: analytical aspects
  of spatial leakage and connectivity estimation
Network theory and inverse modeling are two standard tools of applied
physics, whose combination is needed when studying the dynamical organization
of spatially distributed systems from indirect measurements. However, the
associated connectivity estimation may be affected by spatial leakage, an
artifact of inverse modeling that limits the interpretability of network
analysis. This paper investigates general analytical aspects pertaining to this
issue. First, the existence of spatial leakage is derived from the topological
structure of inverse operators. Then, the geometry of spatial leakage is
modeled and used to define a geometric correction scheme, which limits spatial
leakage effects in connectivity estimation. Finally, this new approach for
network analysis is compared analytically to existing methods based on linear
regressions, which are shown to yield biased coupling estimates.
