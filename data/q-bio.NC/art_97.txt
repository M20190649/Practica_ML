The Hilbert transform of horizontal gaze position during natural image
  classification by saccades
Eye movements are a behavioral response that can be involved in tasks as
complicated as natural image classification. This report confirms that pro- and
anti-saccades can be used by a volunteer to designate target (animal) or
non-target images that were centered 16 degrees off the fixation point. With
more than 86% correct responses, 11 participants responded to targets in 470
milliseconds on average, starting as quick as 245 milliseconds. Furthermore,
tracking the gaze position is considered a powerful method in the studies of
recognition as the saccade response times, ocular dynamics and the events
around the response time can be calculated from the data sampled 240 times per
second. The Hilbert transform is applied to obtain the analytic signal from the
horizontal gaze position. Its amplitude and phase are used to describe
differences between saccades that may testify to the recognition process.
