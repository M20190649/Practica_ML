Is the brain relativistic?
Considering the very large body of knowledge which neuroimaging has put at
our fingertips over the last three decades we looked at the brain with a fresh
view which could unveil those 'old' things in new ways, in a framework which
could help us making predictions tailored made for a scrutiny with the
outstanding imaging instruments to come, such as ultra high field MRI. By doing
so, switching back and forth between physics and neurobiology, we came across
the view that time and space in the brain, as in the Universe, were, indeed,
tightly mingled, and could fade away to be unified through a brain 'spacetime'.
Considering that there is a speed limit for action potentials flowing along
myelinated axons further thinking led us to envision that this 4-dimensional
brain spacetime would obey a kind of relativistic pseudo-diffusion principle
and present a functional curvature governed by brain activity, in a similar way
gravitational masses give our 4-dimensional Universe spacetime its curvature.
We then looked at how this whole-brain framework may shed light on brain
dysfunction phenotypes (clinical expression of diseases) observed in some
neuropsychiatric and consciousness disorders.
