Maximum-entropy from the probability calculus: exchangeability,
  sufficiency
Maximum-entropy distributions are shown to appear in the probability calculus
as approximations of a model by exchangeability or a model by sufficiency, the
former model being preferable. The implications of this fact are discussed,
together with other questions: Prediction or retrodiction? How good is the
maximum-entropy approximation? Is this a "derivation" of maximum-entropy?
