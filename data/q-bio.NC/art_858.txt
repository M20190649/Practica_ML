A model for structured information representation in neural networks
Humans possess the capability to reason at an abstract level and to structure
information into abstract categories, but the underlying neural processes have
remained unknown. Experimental evidence has recently emerged for the
organization of an important aspect of abstract reasoning: for assigning words
to semantic roles in a sentence, such as agent (or subject) and patient (or
object). Using minimal assumptions, we show how such a binding of words to
semantic roles emerges in a generic spiking neural network through Hebbian
plasticity. The resulting model is consistent with the experimental data and
enables new computational functionalities such as structured information
retrieval, copying data, and comparisons. It thus provides a basis for the
implementation of more demanding cognitive computations by networks of spiking
neurons.
