A quantitative comparison between spike-train responses of the
  Hodgkin-Huxley and integrate-and-fire neurons
Spike-train responses of single Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) and integrate-and-fire
(IF) neurons with and without the refractory period, are calculated and
compared. The HH and IF neurons are assumed to receive spike-train inputs with
the constant interspike intervals (ISIs) and stochastic ISIs given by the Gamma
distribution, through excitatory and inhibitory synaptic couplings: for both
the couplings the HH neuron can fire while the IF neuron can only for the
excitatory one. It is shown that the response to the constant-ISI inputs of the
IF neuron strongly depends on the refractory period and the synaptic strength
and that its response is rather different from that of the HH neuron. The
variability of HH and IF neurons depends not only on the jitter of the
stochastic inputs but also on their mean and the synaptic strength. Even for
the excitatory inputs, the type-I IF neuron may be a good substitute of the
type-II HH neuron only in the limited parameter range
