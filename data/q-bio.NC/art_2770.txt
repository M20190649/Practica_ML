Differentially Expressed Functional Connectivity Networks with K-partite
  Graph Topology
Emerging brain network studies suggest that interactions between various
distributed neuronal populations may be characterized by an organized complex
topological structure. Many brain diseases are associated with altered
topological patterns of brain connectivity. Therefore, a key inquiry of
connectivity analysis is to identify network-level differentially expressed
connections that have low false positive rates, sufficient statistical power,
and high reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical
approach to fulfill this goal by leveraging the topological structure of
differentially expressed functional connections or edges in a graphical
representation. We propose a new algorithm to automatically detect the latent
topology of a k-partite graph structure, and we also provide statistical
inferential techniques to test the detected topology. We evaluate our new
methods via extensive numerical studies. We also apply our new approach to
resting state fMRI data (24 cases and 18 controls) for Parkinson's disease
research. The detected connectivity network biomaker with the k-partite graph
topological structure reveals underlying neural features distinguishing
Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects.
