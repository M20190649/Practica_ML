The impact of electrical couplings on the sequential bursting activity
  in the ensemble of inhibitory coupled Van der Pol elements
The new phenomenological model of the ensemble of three neurons with chemical
(synaptic) and electrical couplings has been studied. One neuron is modeled by
a single Van der Pol oscillator. The influence of the electrical coupling
strength and the frequency mismatch between the elements to the regime of
sequential activity is investigated.
