Topological stability of the hippocampal spatial map and synaptic
  transience
Spatial awareness in mammals is based on internalized representations of the
environment---cognitive maps---encoded by networks of spiking neurons. Although
behavioral studies suggest that these maps can remain stable for long periods,
it is also well-known that the underlying networks of synaptic connections
constantly change their architecture due to various forms of neuronal
plasticity. This raises a principal question: how can a dynamic network encode
a stable map of space? In the following, we discuss some recent results
obtained in this direction using an algebro-topological modeling approach,
which demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks
with transient architectures is not only possible, but may be a generic
phenomenon.
