Introduction to the Special Issue on Quantum Cognition
The subject of this special issue is quantum models of cognition. At first
sight it may seem bizarre, even ridiculous, to draw a connection between
quantum mechanics, a highly successful theory usually understood as modeling
sub-atomic phenomena, and cognitive science. However, a growing number of
researchers are looking to quantum theory to circumvent stubborn problems
within their own fields. This is also true within cognitive science and related
areas, hence this special issue.
