Vocabulary and the Brain: Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies
In summary of the research findings presented in this paper, various brain
regions are correlated with vocabulary and vocabulary acquisition. Semantic
associations for vocabulary seem to be located near brain areas that vary
according to the type of vocabulary, e.g. ventral temporal regions important
for words for things that can be seen. Semantic processing is believed to be
strongly associated with the ANG. Phonological ability has been closely related
to the anterior surfaces of the SMG. Pathways through the posterior SMG are
thought to link the anterior SMG and the ANG. In vocabulary tasks,
mediotemporal structures may be related to long-term memory processing, with
left hippocampal and parahippocampal regions related to long-term and working
memory, respectively. Precentral structures are associated with phonological
retrieval. Furthermore, many more regions of the brain are of interest in
vocabulary tasks, particularly in areas important for visual and auditory
processing. Furthermore, differences between brain anatomies can be attributed
to vocabulary demands of different languages.
