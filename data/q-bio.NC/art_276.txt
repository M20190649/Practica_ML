On the evolution of phenomenal consciousness
A number of concepts are included in the term 'consciousness'. We choose to
concentrate here on phenomenal consciousness, the process through which we are
able to experience aspects of our environment or of our physical state. We
probably share this aspect of consciousness with many animals which, like us,
feel pain or pleasure and experience colours, sounds, flavours, etc. Since
phenomenal consciousness is a feature of some living species, we should be able
to account for it in terms of natural selection. Does it have an adaptive
function, or is it an epiphenomenon ? We shall give arguments to reject the
second alternative. We propose that phenomenal properties of consciousness are
involved in a labelling process that allows us to discriminate and to evaluate
mental representations. We also discuss to what extent consciousness as such
has been selected for this labelling function.
