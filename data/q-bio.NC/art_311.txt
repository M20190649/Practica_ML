Speed and accuracy in a visual motion discrimination task as performed
  by rats
We find that rats, like primates and humans, perform better on the random dot
motion task when they take more time to respond. We provide evidence that this
improvement is due to stimulus integration. Rats increase their response
latency modestly as a function of trial difficulty. Rats can modulate response
latency more strongly on a trial by trial basis, apparently on the basis of
reward-related parameters.
