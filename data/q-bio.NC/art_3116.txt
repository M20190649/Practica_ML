Exact Spike Train Inference Via $\ell_0$ Optimization
In recent years, new technologies in neuroscience have made it possible to
measure the activities of large numbers of neurons simultaneously in behaving
animals. For each neuron, a fluorescence trace is measured; this can be seen as
a first-order approximation of the neuron's activity over time. Determining the
exact time at which a neuron spikes on the basis of its fluorescence trace is
an important open problem in the field of computational neuroscience.
  Recently, a convex optimization problem involving an $\ell_1$ penalty was
proposed for this task. In this paper, we slightly modify that recent proposal
by replacing the $\ell_1$ penalty with an $\ell_0$ penalty. In stark contrast
to the conventional wisdom that $\ell_0$ optimization problems are
computationally intractable, we show that the resulting optimization problem
can be efficiently solved for the global optimum using an extremely simple and
efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation of the
proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on fluorescence traces of $100,000$
timesteps. Furthermore, our proposal leads to substantial improvements over the
previous $\ell_1$ proposal, in simulations as well as on two calcium imaging
data sets.
  R-language software for our proposal is available on CRAN in the package
LZeroSpikeInference. Instructions for running this software in python can be
found at https://github.com/jewellsean/LZeroSpikeInference.
