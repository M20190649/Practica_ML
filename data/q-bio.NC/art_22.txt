High conductance states in a mean field cortical network model
Measured responses from visual cortical neurons show that spike times tend to
be correlated rather than exactly Poisson distributed. Fano factors vary and
are usually greater than 1 due to the tendency of spikes being clustered into
bursts. We show that this behavior emerges naturally in a balanced cortical
network model with random connectivity and conductance-based synapses. We
employ mean field theory with correctly colored noise to describe temporal
correlations in the neuronal activity. Our results illuminate the connection
between two independent experimental findings: high conductance states of
cortical neurons in their natural environment, and variable non-Poissonian
spike statistics with Fano factors greater than 1.
