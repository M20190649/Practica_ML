Emergence of Fractional Kinetics in Spiny Dendrites
Fractional extensions of the cable equation have been proposed in the
literature to describe transmembrane potential in spiny dendrites. The
anomalous behavior has been related in the literature to the geometrical
properties of the system, in particular, the density of spines, by experiments,
computer simulations, and in comb-like models.~The same PDE can be related to
more than one stochastic process leading to anomalous diffusion behavior. The
time-fractional diffusion equation can be associated to a continuous time
random walk (CTRW) with power-law waiting time probability or to a special case
of the Erd\'ely-Kober fractional diffusion, described by the ggBm. In this
work, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises
naturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and
in a {\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.
