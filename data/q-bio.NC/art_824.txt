The Creative Process in Musical Composition: An Introspective Account
This chapter charts the creative process in the composition of a piece of
music titled 'Stream not gone dry' that unfolded, while I was primarily
occupied with other matters, over the course of nearly two decades. It avoids
discussion of the technical aspects of musical composition, and it can be read
by someone with no formal knowledge of music. The focus here is on what the
process of composing this particular piece of music says about how the creative
process works. My interpretation of the music-making process may be biased by
my academic view of creativity, but I believe that the influence works
primarily in the other direction, my understanding of how the creative process
works is derived from experiences creating. This intuitive understanding is
shaped over time by the process of reading scholarly papers on creativity and
working them into my own evolving theory of creativity, but the papers that I
resonate with and incorporate are those that are in line with my experience.
This chapter just makes the influence of personal experience more explicit than
in other more scholarly writings on creativity.
