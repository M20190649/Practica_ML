Narrowband oscillations from asynchronous neural activity
We investigate the possibility that narrowband oscillations may emerge from
completely asynchronous, independent neural firing. We find that a population
of asynchronous neurons may produce narrowband oscillations if each neuron
fires quasi-periodically, and we deduce bounds on the degree of variability in
neural spike-timing which will permit the emergence of such oscillations. These
results suggest a novel mechanism of neural rhythmogenesis, and they help to
explain recent experimental reports of large-amplitude local field potential
oscillations in the absence of neural spike-timing synchrony. Simply put,
although synchrony can produce oscillations, oscillations do not always imply
the existence of synchrony.
