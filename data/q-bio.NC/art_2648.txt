Slow Limb Movements Require Precise Control of Muscle Stiffness
Slow and accurate finger and limb movements are essential to daily
activities, but their neural control and governing mechanics are relatively
unexplored. We consider neuromechanical systems where slow movements are
produced by neural commands that modulate muscle stiffness. This formulation
based on strain-energy equilibria is in agreement with prior work on neural
control of muscle and limb impedance. Slow limb movements are driftless in the
sense that movement stops when neural commands stop. We demonstrate, in the
context of two planar tendon-driven systems representing a finger and a leg,
that the control of muscle stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate
limb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove,
however, that stable postures are achievable only when muscles are
pre-tensioned, as is the case for natural muscle tone. Our results further
indicate, in accordance with experimental findings, that slow movements are
non-smooth. The non-smoothness arises because the precision with which
individual muscle stiffnesses need to be controlled changes substantially
throughout the limb's motion. These results underscore the fundamental roles of
muscle tone and accurate neural control of muscle stiffness in producing stable
limb postures and slow movements.
