Dynamical aspects of Kinouchi-Copelli model: emergence of avalanches at
  criticality
We analyze the behavior of bursts of neural activity in the Kinouchi-Copelli
model, originally conceived to explain information processing issues in sensory
systems. We show that, at a critical condition, power-law behavior emerges for
the size and duration of the bursts (avalanches), with exponents experimentally
observed in real biological systems.
