Nonlinear decoding of a complex movie from the mammalian retina
Retinal circuitry transforms spatiotemporal patterns of light into spiking
activity of ganglion cells, which provide the sole visual input to the brain.
Recent advances have led to a detailed characterization of retinal activity and
stimulus encoding by large neural populations. The inverse problem of decoding,
where the stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention,
in particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed
"pixel-by-pixel". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a
rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small discs executing
mutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized)
decoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due
to their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by
locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light
driven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended
on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains,
which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our
results suggest a general paradigm in which downstream neural circuitry could
discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity on the basis of
higher-order statistical structure intrinsic to the incoming spike trains.
