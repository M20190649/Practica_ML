Effective learning is accompanied by high dimensional and efficient
  representations of neural activity
A fundamental cognitive process is the ability to map value and identity onto
objects as we learn about them. Exactly how such mental constructs emerge and
what kind of space best embeds this mapping remains incompletely understood.
Here we develop tools to quantify the space and organization of such a mapping,
thereby providing a framework for studying the geometric representations of
neural responses as reflected in functional MRI. Considering how human subjects
learn the values of novel objects, we show that quick learners have a higher
dimensional geometric representation than slow learners, and hence more easily
distinguishable whole-brain responses to objects of different value.
Furthermore, we find that quick learners display a more compact embedding of
their neural responses and hence have a higher ratio of their task-based
dimension to their embedding dimension -- consistent with a greater efficiency
of cognitive coding. Lastly, we investigate the neurophysiological drivers of
high dimensional patterns at both regional and voxel levels, and we complete
our study with a complementary test of the distinguishability of associated
whole-brain responses. Our results demonstrate a spatial organization of neural
responses characteristic of learning, and offer a suite of geometric measures
applicable to the study of efficient coding in higher-order cognitive processes
more broadly.
