Separating intrinsic interactions from extrinsic correlations in a
  network of sensory neurons
Correlations in sensory neural networks have both extrinsic and intrinsic
origins. Extrinsic or stimulus correlations arise from shared inputs to the
network, and thus depend strongly on the stimulus ensemble. Intrinsic or noise
correlations reflect biophysical mechanisms of interactions between neurons,
which are expected to be robust to changes of the stimulus ensemble. Despite
the importance of this distinction for understanding how sensory networks
encode information collectively, no method exists to reliably separate
intrinsic interactions from extrinsic correlations in neural activity data,
limiting our ability to build predictive models of the network response. In
this paper we introduce a general strategy to infer {population models of
interacting neurons that collectively encode stimulus information}. The key to
disentangling intrinsic from extrinsic correlations is to infer the {couplings
between neurons} separately from the encoding model, and to combine the two
using corrections calculated in a mean-field approximation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on retinal recordings. The same coupling network
is inferred from responses to radically different stimulus ensembles, showing
that these couplings indeed reflect stimulus-independent interactions between
neurons. The inferred model predicts accurately the collective response of
retinal ganglion cell populations as a function of the stimulus.
