Unifying criticality and the neutral theory of neural avalanches
The distribution of collective firing of neurons, known as a neural
avalanche, obeys a power law. Three proposed explanations of this emergent
scale-free behavior are criticality, neutral theory, and self-organized
criticality. We show that the neutral theory of neural avalanches can be
unified with criticality, which requires fine tuning of control parameters, and
rule out self-organized criticality. We study a model of the brain for which
the dynamics are governed by neutral theory. We identify the tuning parameters,
which are consistent with experiments, and show that scale-free neural
avalanches occur only at the critical point. The scaling hypothesis provides a
unified explanation of the power laws which characterize the critical point.
The critical exponents characterizing the avalanche distributions and
divergence of the response functions are shown to be consistent with the
predictions of the scaling hypothesis. We use an universal scaling function for
the avalanche profile to find that the firing rate for avalanches of different
sizes shows data collapse after appropriate rescaling. Critical slowing-down
and algebraic relaxation of avalanches demonstrate that the dynamics are also
consistent with the system being at a critical point. We discuss how our
results can motivate future empirical studies of criticality in the brain.
