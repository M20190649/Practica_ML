From collective rhythm to adaptive synchronization
A novel viewpoint, i.e., adaptive synchronization, is proposed to explore
collective rhythm observed in many complex, self-organizing systems. We show
that a simple adaptive coupling is able to tip arrays of oscillators towards
collective synchronization. Two arrays of simply coupled Hindmarsh-Rose chaotic
neurons are used to illustrate cooperative dynamics of neural activity like the
central pattern generators, which supplies a new idea for biological
experiments and numerical simulations. The results enhance the viewpoint that
chaos is a necessary ingredient in life, and indicate that such small-world
adaptive coupling may be a universal essence of the collective rhythm observed
in nature.
