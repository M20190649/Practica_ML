A novel quantum theory of psychology
The behavior coordinate system and the ideal individual model are presented.
The behavior state of an ideal individual is assumed to be represented by a
behavior state function. Based on the ideal individual model, the behavior
coordinate system and the quantum probability, a novel quantum theory of
psychology is offered here in a different way. It can give some enlightening
viewpoints through which some phenomena can be discussed from a different
perspective.
