Does the 1/f frequency-scaling of brain signals reflect self-organized
  critical states?
Many complex systems display self-organized critical states characterized by
1/f frequency scaling of power spectra. Global variables such as the
electroencephalogram, scale as 1/f, which could be the sign of self-organized
critical states in neuronal activity. By analyzing simultaneous recordings of
global and neuronal activities, we confirm the 1/f scaling of global variables
for selected frequency bands, but show that neuronal activity is not consistent
with critical states. We propose a model of 1/f scaling which does not rely on
critical states, and which is testable experimentally.
