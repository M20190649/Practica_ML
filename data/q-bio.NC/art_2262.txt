Neuronal avalanches of a self-organized neural network with
  active-neuron-dominant structure
Neuronal avalanche is a spontaneous neuronal activity which obeys a power-law
distribution of population event sizes with an exponent of -3/2. It has been
observed in the superficial layers of cortex both \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in
vitro}. In this paper we analyze the information transmission of a novel
self-organized neural network with active-neuron-dominant structure. Neuronal
avalanches can be observed in this network with appropriate input intensity. We
find that the process of network learning via spike-timing dependent plasticity
dramatically increases the complexity of network structure, which is finally
self-organized to be active-neuron-dominant connectivity. Both the entropy of
activity patterns and the complexity of their resulting post-synaptic inputs
are maximized when the network dynamics are propagated as neuronal avalanches.
This emergent topology is beneficial for information transmission with high
efficiency and also could be responsible for the large information capacity of
this network compared with alternative archetypal networks with different
neural connectivity.
