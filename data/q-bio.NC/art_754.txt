Sensory Polymorphism and Behavior: When Machine Vision Meets Monkey Eyes
Polymorphism in the peripheral sensory system (e.g., congenital individual
differences in photopigment configuration) is important in diverse research
fields, ranging from evolutionary biology to engineering, because of its
potential relationship to the cognitive and behavioral variability among
individuals. However, there is a gap between the current understanding of
sensory polymorphism and the behavioral variability that is an outcome of
potentially complex cognitive processes in natural environments. Linking
peripheral sensor properties to behavior requires computational models of
nervous processes transforming sensory representations into actions, based on
quantitative data from physiological and behavioral studies. Recently, studies
based on machine vision approaches are shedding light on the quantitative
relationships between sensory polymorphisms and the resulting behavioral
variability. To reach a convergent understanding of the functional impacts of
sensory polymorphisms in realistic environments, a close coordination among
physiological, behavioral, and computational approaches is required. Aiming at
enhancing such integrative researches, this paper provides an overview for the
recent progresses in those interdisciplinary approaches, and suggests effective
strategies for such integrative paradigms.
