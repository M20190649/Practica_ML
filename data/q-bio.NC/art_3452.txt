Effect of Channel Noise in Synchronization and Metabolic Energy
  Consumption in Unidirectionally Coupled Neurons: Drug Blocking of Sodium and
  Potassium Channels
In this work the stochastic generalization of single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is
further extended to unidirectionally coupled neurons. Our main focus is to
elucidate the role of channel noise in the kinetics and energetics of spiking
of action potential and the synchronization between two coupled neurons. We
have found that the size of the patch is playing the pivotal role in
synchronization and metabolic energy consumption. For example, there exists
three different patch size ranges in which coupled neuron system behaves in a
different manner from noise enhanced phase to dead range state before reaching
the deterministic limit. We have also found that the sodium and potassium
channel blockers have characteristic kinetic and energetic effects on
synchronization process and metabolic energy consumption rate which has been
validated with the simulated data.
