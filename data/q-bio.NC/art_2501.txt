Computational paradigm for dynamic logic-gates in neuronal activity
In 1943 McCulloch and Pitts suggested that the brain is composed of reliable
logic-gates similar to the logic at the core of today's computers. This
framework had a limited impact on neuroscience, since neurons exhibit far
richer dynamics. Here we propose a new experimentally corroborated paradigm in
which the truth tables of the brain's logic-gates are time dependent, i.e.
dynamic logicgates (DLGs). The truth tables of the DLGs depend on the history
of their activity and the stimulation frequencies of their input neurons. Our
experimental results are based on a procedure where conditioned stimulations
were enforced on circuits of neurons embedded within a large-scale network of
cortical cells in-vitro. We demonstrate that the underlying biological
mechanism is the unavoidable increase of neuronal response latencies to ongoing
stimulations, which imposes a nonuniform gradual stretching of network delays.
The limited experimental results are confirmed and extended by simulations and
theoretical arguments based on identical neurons with a fixed increase of the
neuronal response latency per evoked spike. We anticipate our results to lead
to better understanding of the suitability of this computational paradigm to
account for the brain's functionalities and will require the development of new
systematic mathematical methods beyond the methods developed for traditional
Boolean algebra.
