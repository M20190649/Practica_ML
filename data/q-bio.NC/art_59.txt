Participatory Ecosystem Management Planning at Tuzla Lake (Turkey) Using
  Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping
A participatory environmental management plan was prepared for Tuzla Lake,
Turkey. Fuzzy cognitive mapping approach was used to obtain stakeholder views
and desires. Cognitive maps were prepared with 44 stakeholders (villagers,
local decisionmakers, government and non-government organization (NGO)
officials). Graph theory indices, statistical methods and "What-if" simulations
were used in the analysis. The most mentioned variables were livelihood,
agriculture and animal husbandry. The most central variable was agriculture for
local people (villagers and local decisionmakers) and education for NGO &
Government officials. All the stakeholders agreed that livelihood was increased
by agriculture and animal husbandry while hunting decreased birds and wildlife.
Although local people focused on their livelihoods, NGO & Government officials
focused on conservation of Tuzla Lake and education of local people.
Stakeholders indicated that the conservation status of Tuzla Lake should be
strengthened to conserve the ecosystem and biodiversity, which may be
negatively impacted by agriculture and irrigation. Stakeholders mentioned salt
extraction, ecotourism, and carpet weaving as alternative economic activities.
Cognitive mapping provided an effective tool for the inclusion of the
stakeholders' views and ensured initial participation in environmental planning
and policy making.
