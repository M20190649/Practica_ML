Behavioral criteria of feedforward processing in rapid-chase theory:
  Some formal considerations
The rapid-chase theory of response priming defines a set of behavioral
criteria that indicate feedforward processing of visual stimulus features
rather than recurrent processing. These feedforward criteria are strong
predictions from a feedforward model that argues that sequentially presented
prime and target stimuli lead to strictly sequential waves of visuomotor
processing that can still be traced in continuous motor output, for instance,
in pointing movements, muscle forces, or EEG readiness potentials. The
feedforward criteria make it possible to evaluate whether some continuous motor
output is consistent with feedforward processing, even though the neuronal
processes themselves are not readily observable. This paper is intended as an
auxiliary resource that states the criteria with some degree of formal
precision.
