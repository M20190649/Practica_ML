Feeding the human brain model
The goal of the Human Brain Project is to develop during the next decade an
infrastructure necessary for running a simulation of the entire human brain
constrained by current experimental data. One of the key issues is therefore to
integrate and make accessible the experimental data necessary to constrain and
fully specify this model. The required data covers many different spatial
scales, ranging from the molecular scale to the whole brain and these data are
obtained using a variety of techniques whose measurements may not be directly
comparable. Furthermore, these data are incomplete, and will remain so at least
for the coming decade. Here we review new neuroinformatics techniques that need
to be developed and applied to address these issues.
