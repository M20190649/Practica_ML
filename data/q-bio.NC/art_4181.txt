Guiding synchrony through random networks
Sparse random networks contain structures that can be considered as diluted
feed-forward networks. Modeling of cortical circuits has shown that
feed-forward structures, if strongly pronounced compared to the embedding
random network, enable reliable signal transmission by propagating localized
(sub-network) synchrony. This assumed prominence, however, is not
experimentally observed in local cortical circuits. Here we show that nonlinear
dendritic interactions as discovered in recent single neuron experiments,
naturally enable guided synchrony propagation already in random recurrent
neural networks exhibiting mildly enhanced, biologically plausible
sub-structures.
