A temporal access code to consciousness?
While questions of a functional localization of consciousness in the brain
have been the subject of myriad studies, the idea of a temporal access code as
a specific brain mechanism for consciousness has remained a neglected
possibility. Dresp-Langley and Durup (2009, 2012) proposed a theoretical
approach in terms of a temporal access mechanism for consciousness based on its
two universally recognized properties. Consciousness is limited in processing
capacity and described by a unique processing stream across a single dimension,
which is time. The time ordering function of conscious states is highlighted
and neurobiological theories of the temporal brain activities likely to
underlie such function are discussed, and the properties of the code model are
then introduced. Spatial information is integrated into provisory topological
maps at non-conscious levels through adaptive resonant matching, but does not
form part of the temporal access code as such. The latter, de-correlated from
the spatial code, operates without any need for firing synchrony on the sole
basis of temporal coincidence probabilities in dedicated resonant circuits
through progressively non-arbitrary selection of specific temporal activity
patterns in the continuously developing brain.
