Generalized cable theory for neurons in complex and heterogeneous media
Cable theory has been developed over the last decades, usually assuming that
the extracellular space around membranes is a perfect resistor. However,
extracellular media may display more complex electrical properties due to
various phenomena, such as polarization, ionic diffusion or capacitive effects,
but their impact on cable properties is not known. In this paper, we generalize
cable theory for membranes embedded in arbitrarily complex extracellular media.
We outline the generalized cable equations, then consider specific cases. The
simplest case is a resistive medium, in which case the equations recover the
traditional cable equations. We show that for more complex media, for example
in the presence of ionic diffusion, the impact on cable properties such as
voltage attenuation can be significant. We illustrate this numerically always
by comparing the generalized cable to the traditional cable. We conclude that
the nature of intracellular and extracellular media may have a strong influence
on cable filtering as well as on the passive integrative properties of neurons.
