A new method of brain stimulation at ultra-high frequency
Nerve stimulation via micro-electrode implants is one of the neurostimulation
approaches which is used frequently in the medical treatment of some brain
disorders, neural prosthetics, brain-machine interfaces and also in the cyborg.
In this method, the electrical stimulation signal can be categorized by the
frequency band: low frequency, high frequency, and ultra-high frequency. The
stimulation should be less destructive, more smooth, and controllable. In this
article, we present a brief description of the mechanism underlying the
ultra-high frequency stimulation. In the flowing, from an informatics
perspective, we propose a state-of-the-art, low destructive, and highly
efficient stimulation method at the low amplitude ultra-high frequency signal.
In this method, we have tried to reduce the adaptation of the nerve system by
modulating the stimulation signal via a low frequency rectangular random wave.
By this method, we could reach the "almost zero discharge" with minimum
destructive effect in the experimental test on the fish nervous system.
