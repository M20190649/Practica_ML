New Empirical Evidence on Disjunction Effect and Cultural Dependence
We perform new experiment using almost the same sample size considered by
Tversky and Shafir to test the validity of classical probability theory in
decision making. The results clearly indicate that the disjunction effect
depends also on culture and more specifically on gender (females rather than
males). We did more statistical analysis rather that putting the actual values
done by previous authors. We propose different kind of disjunction effect i.e.
strong and weak based on our statistical analysis.
