Consciousness and the structuring property of typical data
The theoretical base for consciousness, in particular an explanation of how
consciousness is defined by the brain, has long been sought by science. We
propose a partial theory of consciousness as relations defined by typical data.
The theory is based on the idea that a brain state on its own is almost
meaningless but in the context of the typical brain states, defined by the
brain's structure, a particular brain state is highly structured by relations.
The proposed theory can be applied and tested both theoretically and
experimentally. Precisely how typical data determines relations is fully
established using discrete mathematics.
