First passage time distribution for spiking neuron with delayed
  excitatory feedback
A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (PDF) $p(t)$ for
distribution of the first passage time of crossing the threshold, which is the
distribution of output interspike intervals (ISI) values for this neuron. The
calculation is based on known PDF $p^0(t)$ for that same neuron without
feedback, intensity of the input stream $\lambda$ and properties of the
feedback line. Also, we derive exact relation for calculating the moments of
$p(t)$ based on known moments of $p^0(t)$.
  The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the "no" answer.
