The multilayer connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans
Connectomics has focused primarily on the mapping of synaptic links in the
brain; yet it is well established that extrasynaptic volume transmission,
especially via monoamines and neuropeptides, is also critical to brain
function. Here we present a draft monoamine connectome, along with a partial
neuropeptide connectome, for the nematode C. elegans, based on new and
published expression data for biosynthetic genes and receptors. Thus, the
neuronal connectome can be represented as a multiplex network, with synaptic,
gap junction, and neuromodulatory layers representing alternative modes of
interneuronal interaction and with distinct network structures. In particular,
the monoamine network exhibits novel topological properties, with a highly
disassortative star-like structure and a rich-club of interconnected
broadcasting hubs. Despite the low degree of overlap between layers, we find
highly significant modes of interaction, pinpointing network locations and
multilink motifs where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic
activity. The multilayer connectome of C. elegans represents a clear exemplar
of a biological multiplex network and provides a prototype for understanding
how extrasynaptic signalling can be integrated into the wired circuitry in
larger brains.
