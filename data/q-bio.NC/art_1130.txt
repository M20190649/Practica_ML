Predictive coding in area V4: dynamic shape discrimination under partial
  occlusion
The primate visual system has an exquisite ability to discriminate partially
occluded shapes. Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response
dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from
prefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may
underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions
based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that
probabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven
solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level
of occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and
feedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about
the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures
key features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC
responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are
less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback
signals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our
study proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with
feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.
