Detecting local processing unit in drosophila brain by using network
  theory
Community detection method in network theory was applied to the neuron
network constructed from the image overlapping between neuron pairs to detect
the Local Processing Unit (LPU) automatically in Drosophila brain. 26
communities consistent with the known LPUs, and 13 subdivisions were found.
Besides, 45 tracts were detected and could be discriminated from the LPUs by
analyzing the distribution of participation coefficient P. Furthermore, layer
structures in fan-shaped body (FB) were observed which coincided with the
images shot by the optical devices, and a total of 13 communities were proven
closely related to FB. The method proposed in this work was proven effective to
identify the LPU structure in Drosophila brain irrespectively of any subjective
aspect, and could be applied to the relevant areas extensively.
