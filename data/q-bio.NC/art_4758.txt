Vitality of Neural Networks under Reoccurring Catastrophic Failures
Catastrophic failures are complete and sudden collapses in the activity of
large networks such as economics, electrical power grids and computer networks,
which typically require a manual recovery process. Here we experimentally show
that excitatory neural networks are governed by a non-Poissonian reoccurrence
of catastrophic failures, where their repetition time follows a multimodal
distribution characterized by a few tenths of a second and tens of seconds
timescales. The mechanism underlying the termination and reappearance of
network activity is quantitatively shown here to be associated with nodal
time-dependent features, neuronal plasticity, where hyperactive nodes damage
the response capability of their neighbors. It presents a complementary
mechanism for the emergence of Poissonian catastrophic failures from damage
conductivity. The effect that hyperactive nodes degenerate their neighbors
represents a type of local competition which is a common feature in the
dynamics of real-world complex networks, whereas their spontaneous recoveries
represent a vitality which enhances reliable functionality.
