Cognitive image processing: the time is right to recognize that the
  world does not rest more on turtles and elephants
Traditional image processing is a field of science and technology developed
to facilitate human-centered image management. But today, when huge volumes of
visual data inundate our surroundings (due to the explosive growth of
image-capturing devices, proliferation of Internet communication means and
video sharing services over the World Wide Web), human-centered handling of
Big-data flows is impossible anymore. Therefore, it has to be replaced with a
machine (computer) supported counterpart. Of course, such an artificial
counterpart must be equipped with some cognitive abilities, usually
characteristic for a human being. Indeed, in the past decade, a new computer
design trend - Cognitive Computer development - is become visible. Cognitive
image processing definitely will be one of its main duties. It must be
specially mentioned that this trend is a particular case of a much more general
movement - the transition from a "computational data-processing paradigm" to a
"cognitive information-processing paradigm", which affects today many fields of
science, technology, and engineering. This transition is a blessed novelty, but
its success is hampered by the lack of a clear delimitation between the notion
of data and the notion of information. Elaborating the case of cognitive image
processing, the paper intends to clarify these important research issues.
