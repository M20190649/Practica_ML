Traveling waves appear and disappear in unison with produced speech
In Rapela (2016) we reported traveling waves (TWs) on electrocorticographic
(ECoG) recordings from an epileptic subject over speech processing brain
regions, while the subject rhythmically produced consonant-vowel syllables
(CVSs). In Rapela (2017) we showed that TWs are precisely synchronized, in
dynamical systems terms, to these productions. Here we show that TWs do not
occur continuously, but tend to appear before the initiation of CVSs and tend
to disappear before their termination. During moments of silence, between
productions of CVSs, TWs tend to reverse direction. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing TWs related to the production of speech and, more
generally, the first report of behavioral correlates of mesoscale TWs in
behaving humans.
