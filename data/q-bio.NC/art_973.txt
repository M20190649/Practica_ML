Geometry of Spatial Memory Replay
Place cells in the rat hippocampus play a key role in creating the animal's
internal representation of the world. During active navigation, these cells
spike only in discrete locations, together encoding a map of the environment.
Electrophysiological recordings have shown that the animal can revisit this map
mentally, during both sleep and awake states, reactivating the place cells that
fired during its exploration in the same sequence they were originally
activated. Although consistency of place cell activity during active navigation
is arguably enforced by sensory and proprioceptive inputs, it remains unclear
how a consistent representation of space can be maintained during spontaneous
replay. We propose a model that can account for this phenomenon and suggests
that a spatially consistent replay requires a number of constraints on the
hippocampal network that affect its synaptic architecture and the statistics of
synaptic connection strengths.
