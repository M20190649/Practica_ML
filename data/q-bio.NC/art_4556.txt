Brain complexity born out of criticality
In this essay we elaborate on recent evidence demonstrating the presence of a
second order phase transition in human brain dynamics and discuss its
consequences for theoretical approaches to brain function. We review early
evidence of criticality in brain dynamics at different spatial and temporal
scales, and we stress how it was necessary to unify concepts and analysis
techniques across scales to introduce the adequate order and control parameters
which define the transition. A discussion on the relation between structural
vs. dynamical complexity exposes future steps to understand the dynamics of the
connectome (structure) from which emerges the cognitome (function).
