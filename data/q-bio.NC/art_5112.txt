Information parity in complex networks
A growing interest in complex networks theory results in an ongoing demand
for new analytical tools. We propose a novel measure based on information
theory that provides a new perspective for a better understanding of networked
systems: Termed "information parity," it quantifies the consonance of influence
among nodes with respect to the whole network architecture. Considering the
statistics of geodesic distances, information parity detects how similar a pair
of nodes can influence and be influenced by the network. This allows us to
quantify the quality of information gathered by the nodes. To demonstrate the
method's potential, we evaluate a social network and human brain networks. Our
results indicate that emerging phenomena like an ideological orientation of
nodes in a social network is severely influenced by their information parities.
We also show that anatomical brain networks have a greater information parity
in inter-hemispheric correspondent regions placed near the sagittal plane.
Finally, functional networks have, on average, greater information parity for
inter-hemispheric correspondent regions in comparison to the whole network. We
find that a pair of regions with high information parity exhibits higher
correlation, suggesting that the functional correlations between cortical
regions can be partially explained by the symmetry of their overall influences
of the whole brain.
