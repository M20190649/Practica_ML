What makes a neural code convex?
Neural codes allow the brain to represent, process, and store information
about the world. Combinatorial codes, comprised of binary patterns of neural
activity, encode information via the collective behavior of populations of
neurons. A code is called convex if its codewords correspond to regions defined
by an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space. Convex codes have
been observed experimentally in many brain areas, including sensory cortices
and the hippocampus, where neurons exhibit convex receptive fields. What makes
a neural code convex? That is, how can we tell from the intrinsic structure of
a code if there exists a corresponding arrangement of convex open sets? In this
work, we provide a complete characterization of local obstructions to
convexity. This motivates us to define max intersection-complete codes, a
family guaranteed to have no local obstructions. We then show how our
characterization enables one to use free resolutions of Stanley-Reisner ideals
in order to detect violations of convexity. Taken together, these results
provide a significant advance in understanding the intrinsic combinatorial
properties of convex codes.
