On-off intermittency of thalamo-cortical oscillations in the
  electroencephalogram of rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy
Spike-wave discharges (SWD) are electroencephalographic hallmarks of absence
epilepsy. SWD are known to originate from thalamo-cortical neuronal network
that normally produce sleep spindle oscillations. Although both sleep spindles
and SWD are considered as thalamo-cortical oscillations, functional
relationship between them is still uncertain. The present study describes
temporal dynamics of SWD and sleep spindles as determined in long-term EEG
recordings in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. It was found that
non-linear dynamics of SWD fits well to the law of 'on-off intermittency'.
Typical sleep spindles that occur during slow-wave sleep (SWS) also
demonstrated 'on-off intermittency' behavior, in contrast to high-voltage
spindles during intermediate sleep stage, whose dynamics was uncertain. This
implies that both SWS sleep spindles and SWD are controlled by a system-level
mechanism that is responsible for regulating circadian activity and/or
sleep-wake transitions.
