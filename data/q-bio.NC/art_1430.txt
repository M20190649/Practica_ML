Subdivisions of the posteromedial cortex in disorders of consciousness
Evidence suggests that disruptions of the posteromedial cortex (PMC) and
posteromedial corticothalamic connectivity contribute to disorders of
consciousness (DOCs). While most previous studies treated the PMC as a whole,
this structure is functionally heterogeneous. The present study investigated
whether particular subdivisions of the PMC are specifically associated with
DOCs. Participants were DOC patients, 21 vegetative state/unresponsive
wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), 12 minimally conscious state (MCS), and 29
healthy controls. Individual PMC and thalamus were divided into distinct
subdivisions by their fiber tractograpy to each other and default mode regions,
and white matter integrity and brain activity between/within subdivisions were
assessed. The thalamus was represented mainly in the dorsal and posterior
portions of the PMC, and the white matter tracts connecting these subdivisions
to the thalamus had less integrity in VS/UWS patients than in MCS patients and
healthy controls, as well as in patients who did not recover after 12 months
than in patients who did. The structural substrates were validated by finding
impaired functional fluctuations within this PMC subdivision. This study is the
first to show that tracts from dorsal and posterior subdivisions of the PMC to
the thalamus contribute to DOCs.
