Complex activity patterns generated by short-term synaptic plasticity
Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) affects the efficiency of synaptic
transmission for persistent presynaptic activities. We consider attractor
neural networks, for which the attractors are given, in the absence of STSP, by
cell assemblies of excitatory cliques. We show that STSP may transform these
attracting states into attractor relics, inducing ongoing transient-state
dynamics in terms of sequences of transiently activated cell assemblies, the
former attractors. Subsequent cell assemblies may be both disjoint or partially
overlapping. It may hence be possible to use the resulting dynamics for the
generation of motor control sequences.
