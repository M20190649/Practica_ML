General representation of collective neural dynamics with columnar
  modularity
We exhibit a mathematical framework to represent the neural dynamics at
cortical level. Our description of neural dynamics with columnar and functional
modularity, named fibre bundle representation (FBM) method, is based both on
neuroscience and informatics, whereas they correspond with the conventional
formulas in statistical physics. In spite of complex interactions in neural
circuitry and various cortical modification rules per models, some significant
factors determine the typical phenomena in cortical dynamics. The FBM
representation method reveals them plainly and gives profit in building or
analyzing the cortical dynamic models. Not only the similarity in formulas, the
cortical dynamics can share the statistical properties with other physical
systems, which validated in primary visual maps. We apply our method to
proposed models in visual map formations, in addition our suggestion using the
lateral interaction scheme. In this paper, we will show that the neural dynamic
procedures can be treated through conventional physics expressions and
theories.
