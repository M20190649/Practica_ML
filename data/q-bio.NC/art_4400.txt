The topology of the directed clique complex as a network invariant
We introduce new algebro-topological invariants of directed networks, based
on the topological construction of the directed clique complex. The shape of
the underlying directed graph is encoded in a way that can be studied
mathematically to obtain network invariants such as the Euler characteristic
and the Betti numbers. Two different cases illustrate the application of the
Euler characteristic. We investigate how the evolution of a Boolean recurrent
artificial neural network is influenced by its topology in a dynamics involving
pruning and strengthening of the connections, and to show that the topological
features of the directed clique complex influence the dynamical evolution of
the network. The second application considers the directed clique complex in a
broader framework, to define an invariant of directed networks, the network
degree invariant, which is constructed by computing the topological invariant
on a sequence of sub-networks filtered by the minimum in- or out-degree of the
nodes. The application of the Euler characteristic presented here can be
extended to any directed network and provides a new method for the assessment
of specific functional features associated with the network topology.
