RRAM based neuromorphic algorithms
This submission is a report on RRAM based neuromorphic algorithms. This
report basically gives an overview of the algorithms implemented on
neuromorphic hardware with crossbar array of RRAM synapses. This report mainly
talks about the work on deep neural network to spiking neural network
conversion and its significance.
