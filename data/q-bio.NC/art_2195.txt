Anti-phase synchronization of phase-reduced oscillators using open-loop
  control
In this letter, we present an elegant method to build and maintain an
anti-phase configuration of two nonlinear oscillators with different natural
frequencies and dynamics described by the sinusoidal phase-reduced model. The
anti-phase synchronization is achieved using a common input that couples the
oscillators and consists of a sequence of square pulses of appropriate
amplitude and duration. This example provides a proof of principle that
open-loop control can be used to create desired synchronization patterns for
nonlinear oscillators, when feedback is expensive or impossible to obtain.
