Evaluation of the criticality of in vitro neuronal networks: Toward an
  assessment of computational capacity
Novel computing hardwares are necessary to keep up with today's increasing
demand for data storage and processing power. In this research project, we turn
to the brain for inspiration to develop novel computing substrates that are
self-learning, scalable, energy-efficient, and fault-tolerant. The overarching
aim of this work is to develop computational models that are able to reproduce
target behaviors observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will be
ultimately be used to aid in the realization of these behaviors in a more
engineerable substrate: an array of nanomagnets. The target behaviors will be
identified by analyzing electrophysiological recordings of the neuronal
networks. Preliminary analysis has been performed to identify when a network is
in a critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches
of activity, and the results of this analysis are reported here. This
classification of critical versus non-critical networks is valuable in
identifying networks that can be expected to perform well on computational
tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the state in which a system is
best suited for computation. This type of analysis is expected to enable the
identification of networks that are well-suited for computation and the
classification of networks as perturbed or healthy.
