Monolingual and bilingual language networks in healthy subjects using
  functional MRI and graph theory
Pre-surgical language mapping with functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) is routinely conducted to assist the neurosurgeon in preventing damage
to brain regions responsible for language. Functional differences exist between
the monolingual versus the bilingual brain, whereas clinical fMRI tasks are
typically conducted in a single language. The presence of secondary language
processing mechanisms is a potential source of error in the inferred language
map. From fMRI data of healthy bilingual and monolingual subjects we obtain
language maps as functional networks. Our results show a sub-network "core"
architecture consisting of the Broca's, pre-supplementary motor, and premotor
areas present across all subjects. Wernicke's Area was found to connect to the
"core" to a different extent across groups. The $k$ core centrality measure
shows "core" areas belong to the maximum core while WA and other fROIs vary
across groups. The results may provide a benchmark to preserve equal treatment
outcomes for bilingual patients.
