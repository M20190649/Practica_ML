Transient Information Flow in a Network of Excitatory and Inhibitory
  Model Neurons: Role of Noise and Signal Autocorrelation
We investigate the performance of sparsely-connected networks of
integrate-and-fire neurons for ultra-short term information processing. We
exploit the fact that the population activity of networks with balanced
excitation and inhibition can switch from an oscillatory firing regime to a
state of asynchronous irregular firing or quiescence depending on the rate of
external background spikes.
  We find that in terms of information buffering the network performs best for
a moderate, non-zero, amount of noise. Analogous to the phenomenon of
stochastic resonance the performance decreases for higher and lower noise
levels. The optimal amount of noise corresponds to the transition zone between
a quiescent state and a regime of stochastic dynamics. This provides a
potential explanation on the role of non-oscillatory population activity in a
simplified model of cortical micro-circuits.
