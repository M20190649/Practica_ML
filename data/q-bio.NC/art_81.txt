Stable Propagation of a Burst Through a One-Dimensional Homogeneous
  Excitatory Chain Model of Songbird Nucleus HVC
We demonstrate numerically that a brief burst consisting of two to six spikes
can propagate in a stable manner through a one-dimensional homogeneous
feedforward chain of non-bursting neurons with excitatory synaptic connections.
Our results are obtained for two kinds of neuronal models, leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with five
conductances. Over a range of parameters such as the maximum synaptic
conductance, both kinds of chains are found to have multiple attractors of
propagating bursts, with each attractor being distinguished by the number of
spikes and total duration of the propagating burst. These results make
plausible the hypothesis that sparse precisely-timed sequential bursts observed
in projection neurons of nucleus HVC of a singing zebra finch are intrinsic and
causally related.
