Efficient Probabilistic Inference in Generic Neural Networks Trained
  with Non-Probabilistic Feedback
Animals perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in a wide range of
psychophysical tasks. Probabilistic inference requires trial-to-trial
representation of the uncertainties associated with task variables and
subsequent use of this representation. Previous work has implemented such
computations using neural networks with hand-crafted and task-dependent
operations. We show that generic neural networks trained with a simple
error-based learning rule perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in nine
common psychophysical tasks. In a probabilistic categorization task,
error-based learning in a generic network simultaneously explains a monkey's
learning curve and the evolution of qualitative aspects of its choice behavior.
In all tasks, the number of neurons required for a given level of performance
grows sub-linearly with the input population size, a substantial improvement on
previous implementations of probabilistic inference. The trained networks
develop a novel sparsity-based probabilistic population code. Our results
suggest that probabilistic inference emerges naturally in generic neural
networks trained with error-based learning rules.
