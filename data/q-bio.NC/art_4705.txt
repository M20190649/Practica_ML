Intertangled stochastic motifs in networks of excitatory-inhibitory
  units
A stochastic model of excitatory and inhibitory interactions which bears
universality traits is introduced and studied. The endogenous component of
noise, stemming from finite size corrections, drives robust inter-nodes
correlations, that persist at large large distances. Anti-phase synchrony at
small frequencies is resolved on adjacent nodes and found to promote the
spontaneous generation of long-ranged stochastic patterns, that invade the
network as a whole. These patterns are lacking under the idealized
deterministic scenario, and could provide novel hints on how living systems
implement and handle a large gallery of delicate computational tasks.
