Passive nonlinear dendritic interactions as a general computational
  resource in functional spiking neural networks
Nonlinear interactions in the dendritic tree play a key role in neural
computation. Nevertheless, modeling frameworks aimed at the construction of
large-scale, functional spiking neural networks tend to assume linear,
current-based superposition of post-synaptic currents. We extend the theory
underlying the Neural Engineering Framework to systematically exploit nonlinear
interactions between the local membrane potential and conductance-based
synaptic channels as a computational resource. In particular, we demonstrate
that even a single passive distal dendritic compartment with AMPA and GABA-A
synapses connected to a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron supports the
computation of a wide variety of multivariate, bandlimited functions, including
the Euclidean norm, controlled shunting, and non-negative multiplication. Our
results demonstrate that, for certain operations, the accuracy of dendritic
computation is on a par with or even surpasses the accuracy of an additional
layer of neurons in the network. These findings allow modelers to construct
large-scale models of neurobiological systems that closer approximate network
topologies and computational resources available in biology. Our results may
inform neuromorphic hardware design and could lead to a better utilization of
resources on existing neuromorphic hardware platforms.
