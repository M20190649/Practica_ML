Brain state stability during working memory is explained by network
  control theory, modulated by dopamine D1/D2 receptor function, and diminished
  in schizophrenia
Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory
but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that
working memory entails brainwide switching between activity states. The
stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state
transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological
modulation. Schizophrenia patients show altered network control properties,
including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
memory representations.
