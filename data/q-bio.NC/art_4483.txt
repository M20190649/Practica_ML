Exceedance Probabilities for the Dirichlet Distribution
We derive an efficient method to calculate exceedance probabilities (EP) for
the Dirichlet distribution when the number of event types is larger than two.
Also, we present an intuitive application of Dirichlet EPs and compare our
method to a sampling approach which is the current practice in neuroimaging
model selection.
