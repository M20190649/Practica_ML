Visceral theory of sleep and origins of mental disorders
Visceral theory of sleep states that the same brain neurons, which process
external information in wakefulness, during sleep switch to the processing of
internal information coming from various visceral systems. Here we hypothesize
that a failure in the commutation of exteroceptive and interoceptive
information flows in the brain can manifest itself as a mental illness.
