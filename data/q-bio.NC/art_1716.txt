Characterizing signal encoding and transmission in class I and class II
  neurons via ordinal time-series analysis
Neurons encode and transmit information in spike sequences. However, despite
the effort devoted to quantify their information content, little progress has
been made in this regard. Here we use a nonlinear method of time-series
analysis (known as ordinal analysis) to compare the statistics of spike
sequences generated by applying an input signal to the neuronal model of
Morris-Lecar. In particular we consider two different regimes for the neurons
which lead to two classes of excitability: class I, where the frequency-current
curve is continuous and class II, where the frequency-current curve is
discontinuous.
  By applying ordinal analysis to sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) our
goals are (1) to investigate if different neuron types can generate spike
sequences which have similar symbolic properties;
  (2) to get deeper understanding on the effects that electrical (diffusive)
and excitatory chemical (i.e., excitatory synapse) couplings have; and (3) to
compare, when a small--amplitude periodic signal is applied to one of the
neurons, how the signal features (amplitude and frequency) are encoded and
transmitted in the generated ISI sequences for both class I and class II type
neurons and electrical or chemical couplings. We find that depending on the
frequency, specific combinations of neuron/class and coupling-type allow a more
effective encoding, or a more effective transmission of the signal.
