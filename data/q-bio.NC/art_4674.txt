Organization and hierarchy of the human functional brain network lead to
  a chain-like core
The brain is a paradigmatic example of a complex system as its functionality
emerges as a global property of local mesoscopic and microscopic interactions.
Complex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the
brain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and
to extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans during the
resting condition for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional
brain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by
forming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered
anatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of
the occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form
a closed core. We also report the hierarchy of network segregation and the
level of clusters integration as a function of the connectivity strength
between brain regions.
