Chance, long tails, and inference: a non-Gaussian, Bayesian theory of
  vocal learning in songbirds
Traditional theories of sensorimotor learning posit that animals use sensory
error signals to find the optimal motor command in the face of Gaussian sensory
and motor noise. However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral
observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily
corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually
introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of
sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that
the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather
than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via
Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this
theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the
pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory
feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung
pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains
the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising
predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we
confirm experimentally.
