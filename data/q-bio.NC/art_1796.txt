Imaginary Fields
Nonlinear dynamical modeling of interaction between automatic and conscious
processes in the human brain is considered in terms of the quaternion fields.
The interaction is due, particularly, to the nonlinear firing rate of neurons.
Possible connection of consciousness with the general field theory is
indicated. A new type of symmetry between dynamics of real and imaginary fields
is pointed out.
