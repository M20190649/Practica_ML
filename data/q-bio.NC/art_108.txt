Simulation of networks of spiking neurons: A review of tools and
  strategies
We review different aspects of the simulation of spiking neural networks. We
start by reviewing the different types of simulation strategies and algorithms
that are currently implemented. We next review the precision of those
simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the
exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation
environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open
source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls
are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is
appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark
simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including
Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based
or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration
strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators,
and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to
provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration
strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to
spiking neural networks.
