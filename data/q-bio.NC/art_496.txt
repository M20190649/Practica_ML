Biased perception leads to biased action: Validating a Bayesian model of
  interception
We tested whether and how biases in visual perception might influence motor
actions. To do so, we designed an interception task in which subjects had to
indicate the time when a moving object, whose trajectory was occluded, would
reach a target area. Subjects made their judgments based on a brief display of
the object's initial motion at a given starting point. Based on the known
illusion that slow contrast stimuli appear to move slower than high contrast
ones, we predict that if perception directly influences motion actions subjects
would show delayed interception times for low contrast objects. In order to
provide a more quantitative prediction, we developed a Bayesian model for the
complete sensory-motor interception task. Using fit parameters for the prior
and likelihood on visual speed from a previous study we were able to predict
not only the expected interception times but also the precise characteristics
of response variability. Psychophysical experiments confirm the model's
predictions. Individual differences in subjects' timing responses can be
accounted for by individual differences in the perceptual priors on visual
speed. Taken together, our behavioral and model results show that biases in
perception percolate downstream and cause action biases that are fully
predictable.
