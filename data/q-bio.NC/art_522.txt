'A Vehicle of Symbols and Nothing More.' George Romanes, Theory of Mind,
  Information, and Samuel Butler
Today's 'theory of mind' (ToM) concept is rooted in the distinction of
nineteenth century philosopher William Clifford between 'objects' that can be
directly perceived, and 'ejects,' such as the mind of another person, which are
inferred from one's subjective knowledge of one's own mind. A founder, with
Charles Darwin, of the discipline of comparative psychology, George Romanes
considered the minds of animals as ejects, an idea that could be generalized to
'society as eject' and, ultimately, 'the world as an eject' - mind in the
universe. Yet, Romanes and Clifford only vaguely connected mind with the
abstraction we call 'information,' which needs 'a vehicle of symbols' - a
material transporting medium. However, Samuel Butler was able to address, in
informational terms depleted of theological trappings, both organic evolution
and mind in the universe. This view harmonizes with insights arising from
modern DNA research, the relative immortality of 'selfish' genes, and some
startling recent developments in brain research.
