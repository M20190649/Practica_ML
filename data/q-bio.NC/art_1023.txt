Neural Sampling by Irregular Gating Inhibition of Spiking Neurons and
  Attractor Networks
A long tradition in theoretical neuroscience casts sensory processing in the
brain as the process of inferring the maximally consistent interpretations of
imperfect sensory input. Recently it has been shown that Gamma-band inhibition
can enable neural attractor networks to approximately carry out such a sampling
mechanism. In this paper we propose a novel neural network model based on
irregular gating inhibition, show analytically how it implements a Monte-Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) sampler, and describe how it can be used to model networks
of both neural attractors as well as of single spiking neurons. Finally we show
how this model applied to spiking neurons gives rise to a new putative
mechanism that could be used to implement stochastic synaptic weights in
biological neural networks and in neuromorphic hardware.
