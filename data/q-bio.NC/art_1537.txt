Topology of the mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain
The wiring diagram of the mouse brain has recently been mapped at a
mesoscopic scale in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. Axonal
projections from brain regions were traced using green fluoresent proteins. The
resulting data were registered to a common three-dimensional reference space.
They yielded a matrix of connection strengths between 213 brain regions. Global
features such as closed loops formed by connections of similar intensity can be
inferred using tools from persistent homology. We map the wiring diagram of the
mouse brain to a simplicial complex (filtered by connection strengths). We work
out generators of the first homology group. Some regions, including nucleus
accumbens, are connected to the entire brain by loops, whereas no region has
non-zero connection strength to all brain regions. Thousands of loops go
through the isocortex, the striatum and the thalamus. On the other hand,
medulla is the only major brain compartment that contains more than 100 loops.
