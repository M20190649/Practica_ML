Dynamical learning of dynamics
The ability of humans and animals to quickly adapt to novel tasks is
difficult to reconcile with the standard paradigm of learning by slow synaptic
weight modification. Here we show that already static neural networks can learn
to generate required dynamics by imitation. After appropriate weight
pretraining, the networks dynamically adapt to learn new tasks and thereafter
continue to achieve them without further teacher feedback. We explain this
ability and illustrate it with a variety of target dynamics, ranging from
oscillatory trajectories to driven and chaotic dynamical systems.
