Dynamic Network Centrality Summarizes Learning in the Human Brain
We study functional activity in the human brain using functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging and recently developed tools from network science. The data
arise from the performance of a simple behavioural motor learning task.
Unsupervised clustering of subjects with respect to similarity of network
activity measured over three days of practice produces significant evidence of
`learning', in the sense that subjects typically move between clusters (of
subjects whose dynamics are similar) as time progresses. However, the high
dimensionality and time-dependent nature of the data makes it difficult to
explain which brain regions are driving this distinction. Using network
centrality measures that respect the arrow of time, we express the data in an
extremely compact form that characterizes the aggregate activity of each brain
region in each experiment using a single coefficient, while reproducing
information about learning that was discovered using the full data set. This
compact summary allows key brain regions contributing to centrality to be
visualized and interpreted. We thereby provide a proof of principle for the use
of recently proposed dynamic centrality measures on temporal network data in
neuroscience.
