Assessment of corticospinal tract dysfunction and disease severity in
  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
The upper motor neuron dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was
quantified using triple stimulation and more focal transcranial magnetic
stimulation techniques that were developed to reduce recording variability.
These measurements were combined with clinical and neurophysiological data to
develop a novel random forest based supervised machine learning prediction
model. This model was capable of predicting cross-sectional ALS disease
severity as measured by the ALSFRSr scale with 97% overall accuracy and 99%
precision. The machine learning model developed in this research provides a
new, unique and objective diagnostic method for quantifying disease severity
and identifying subtle changes in disease progression in ALS.
