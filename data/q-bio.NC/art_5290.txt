On selective influences, marginal selectivity, and Bell/CHSH
  inequalities
The Bell/CHSH inequalities of quantum physics are identical with the
inequalities derived in mathematical psychology for the problem of selective
influences in cases involving two bi- nary experimental factors and two binary
random variables recorded in response to them. The following points are made
regarding cognitive science applications: (1) compliance of data with these
inequalities is informative only if the data satisfy the requirement known as
marginal selectivity; (2) both violations of marginal selectivity and
violations of the Bell/CHSH inequalities are interpretable as indicating that
at least one of the two responses is influenced by both experimental factors.
