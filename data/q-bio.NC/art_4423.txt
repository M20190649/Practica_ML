Emergence and coherence of oscillations in star networks of stochastic
  excitable elements
We study the emergence and coherence of stochastic oscillations in star
networks of excitable elements in which peripheral nodes receive independent
random inputs. A biophysical model of a distal branch of sensory neuron in
which peripheral nodes of Ranvier are coupled to a central node by myelinated
cable segments is used along with a generic model of networked stochastic
active rotators. We show that coherent oscillations can emerge due to
stochastic synchronization of peripheral nodes and that the degree of coherence
can be maximized by tuning the coupling strength and the size of the network.
Analytical results are obtained for the strong coupling regime of the active
rotator network. In particular, we show that in the strong coupling regime the
network dynamics can be described by an effective single active rotator with
rescaled parameters and noise.
