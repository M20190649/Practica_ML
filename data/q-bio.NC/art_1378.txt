Information of Epileptic Mechanism and its Systemic Change-points in a
  Zebrafish's Brain-wide Calcium Imaging Video Data
The epileptic mechanism is postulated as that an animal's neurons gradually
diminish their inhibition function coupled with enhanced excitation when an
epileptic event is approaching. Calcium imaging technique is designed to
directly record brain-wide neurons activity in order to discover the underlying
epileptic mechanism. In this paper, using one brain-wide calcium imaging video
of Zebrafish, we compute dynamic pattern information of the epileptic
mechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional
aspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of
our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal
phenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that
each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular
fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the
oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are
collectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early
warning signal (EWS) of an incoming epileptic event. We conclude through the
graphic displays that pattern information extracted from the calcium imaging
video realistically reveals the Zebrafish's authentic epileptic mechanism.
