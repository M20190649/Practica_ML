Simultaneous whole-animal 3D-imaging of neuronal activity using light
  field microscopy
3D functional imaging of neuronal activity in entire organisms at single cell
level and physiologically relevant time scales faces major obstacles due to
trade-offs between the size of the imaged volumes, and spatial and temporal
resolution. Here, using light-field microscopy in combination with 3D
deconvolution, we demonstrate intrinsically simultaneous volumetric functional
imaging of neuronal population activity at single neuron resolution for an
entire organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The simplicity of our
technique and possibility of the integration into epi-fluoresence microscopes
makes it an attractive tool for high-speed volumetric calcium imaging.
