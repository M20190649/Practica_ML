Critical and resonance phenomena in neural networks
Brain rhythms contribute to every aspect of brain function. Here, we study
critical and resonance phenomena that precede the emergence of brain rhythms.
Using an analytical approach and simulations of a cortical circuit model of
neural networks with stochastic neurons in the presence of noise, we show that
spontaneous appearance of network oscillations occurs as a dynamical
(non-equilibrium) phase transition at a critical point determined by the noise
level, network structure, the balance between excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, and other parameters. We find that the relaxation time of neural
activity to a steady state, response to periodic stimuli at the frequency of
the oscillations, amplitude of damped oscillations, and stochastic fluctuations
of neural activity are dramatically increased when approaching the critical
point of the transition.
