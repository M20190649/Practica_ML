Modeling networks of spiking neurons as interacting processes with
  memory of variable length
We consider a new class of non Markovian processes with a countable number of
interacting components, both in discrete and continuous time. Each component is
represented by a point process indicating if it has a spike or not at a given
time. The system evolves as follows. For each component, the rate (in
continuous time) or the probability (in discrete time) of having a spike
depends on the entire time evolution of the system since the last spike time of
the component. In discrete time this class of systems extends in a non trivial
way both Spitzer's interacting particle systems, which are Markovian, and
Rissanen's stochastic chains with memory of variable length which have finite
state space. In continuous time they can be seen as a kind of Rissanen's
variable length memory version of the class of self-exciting point processes
which are also called "Hawkes processes", however with infinitely many
components. These features make this class a good candidate to describe the
time evolution of networks of spiking neurons. In this article we present a
critical reader's guide to recent papers dealing with this class of models,
both in discrete and in continuous time. We briefly sketch results concerning
perfect simulation and existence issues, de-correlation between successive
interspike intervals, the longtime behavior of finite non-excited systems and
propagation of chaos in mean field systems.
