PCA meets RG
A system with many degrees of freedom can be characterized by a covariance
matrix; principal components analysis (PCA) focuses on the eigenvalues of this
matrix, hoping to find a lower dimensional description. But when the spectrum
is nearly continuous, any distinction between components that we keep and those
that we ignore becomes arbitrary; it then is natural to ask what happens as we
vary this arbitrary cutoff. We argue that this problem is analogous to the
momentum shell renormalization group (RG). Following this analogy, we can
define relevant and irrelevant operators, where the role of dimensionality is
played by properties of the eigenvalue density. These results also suggest an
approach to the analysis of real data. As an example, we study neural activity
in the vertebrate retina as it responds to naturalistic movies, and find
evidence of behavior controlled by a nontrivial fixed point. Applied to
financial data, our analysis separates modes dominated by sampling noise from a
smaller but still macroscopic number of modes described by a non--Gaussian
distribution.
