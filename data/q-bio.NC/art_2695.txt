On the low dimensional dynamics of structured random networks
Using a generalized random recurrent neural network model, and by extending
our recently developed mean-field approach [J. Aljadeff, M. Stern, T. Sharpee,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 088101 (2015)], we study the relationship between the
network connectivity structure and its low dimensional dynamics. Each
connection in the network is a random number with mean 0 and variance that
depends on pre- and post-synaptic neurons through a sufficiently smooth
function $g$ of their identities. We find that these networks undergo a phase
transition from a silent to a chaotic state at a critical point we derive as a
function of $g$. Above the critical point, although unit activation levels are
chaotic, their autocorrelation functions are restricted to a low dimensional
subspace. This provides a direct link between the network's structure and some
of its functional characteristics. We discuss example applications of the
general results to neuroscience where we derive the support of the spectrum of
connectivity matrices with heterogeneous and possibly correlated degree
distributions, and to ecology where we study the stability of the cascade model
for food web structure.
