Distributions of covariances as a window into the operational regime of
  neuronal networks
Massively parallel recordings of spiking activity in cortical networks show
that covariances vary widely across pairs of neurons. Their low average is well
understood, but an explanation for the wide distribution in relation to the
static (quenched) disorder of the connectivity in recurrent random networks was
so far elusive. We here derive a finite-size mean-field theory that reduces a
disordered to a highly symmetric network with fluctuating auxiliary fields. The
exposed analytical relation between the statistics of connections and the
statistics of pairwise covariances shows that both, average and dispersion of
the latter, diverge at a critical coupling. At this point, a network of
nonlinear units transits from regular to chaotic dynamics. Applying these
results to recordings from the mammalian brain suggests its operation close to
this edge of criticality.
