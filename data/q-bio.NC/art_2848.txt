A memory mechanism based on two dimensional code of neurosome pattern
We have recognized that 2D codes, i.e., a group of strongly connected
neurosomes that can be simultaneously excited, are the basic data carriers for
memory in a brain. An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of
neurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes
enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory
information are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a
human brain is estimated to be one billion of 2D codes. By triggering one or
more neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected
neurosome network is capable of exciting simultaneously and projecting its
excitation onto an analysis layer of neurons in cortex, thus retrieving the
stored memory data. The capability of comparing two 2D codes in the analysis
layer is one of the major brain functions.
