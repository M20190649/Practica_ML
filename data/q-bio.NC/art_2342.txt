Real-Time Phase Masks for Interactive Stimulation of Optogenetic Neurons
Experiments with networks of optogenetically altered neurons require
stimulation with high spatio-temporal selectivity. Computer-assisted holography
is an energy-efficient method for robust and reliable addressing of single
neurons on the millisecond-timescale inherent to biologial information
processing. We show that real-time control of neurons can be achieved by a
CUDA-based hologram computation.
