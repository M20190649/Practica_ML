Quantum-like models cannot account for the conjunction fallacy
Human agents happen to judge that a conjunction of two terms is more probable
than one of the terms, in contradiction with the rules of classical
probabilities---this is the conjunction fallacy. One of the most discussed
accounts of this fallacy is currently the quantum-like explanation, which
relies on models exploiting the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The aim of
this paper is to investigate the empirical adequacy of major quantum-like
models which represent beliefs with quantum states. We first argue that they
can be tested in three different ways, in a question order effect configuration
which is different from the traditional conjunction fallacy experiment. We then
carry out our proposed experiment, with varied methodologies from experimental
economics. The experimental results we get are at odds with the predictions of
the quantum-like models. This strongly suggests that this quantum-like account
of the conjunction fallacy fails. Future possible research paths are discussed.
