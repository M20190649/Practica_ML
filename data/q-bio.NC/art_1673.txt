An introduction to time-resolved decoding analysis for M/EEG
The human brain is constantly processing and integrating information in order
to make decisions and interact with the world, for tasks from recognizing a
familiar face to playing a game of tennis. These complex cognitive processes
require communication between large populations of neurons. The non-invasive
neuroimaging methods of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) provide population measures of neural activity with millisecond precision
that allow us to study the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes. However,
multi-sensor M/EEG data is inherently high dimensional, making it difficult to
parse important signal from noise. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or
"decoding" methods offer vast potential for understanding high-dimensional
M/EEG neural data. MVPA can be used to distinguish between different conditions
and map the time courses of various neural processes, from basic sensory
processing to high-level cognitive processes. In this chapter, we discuss the
practical aspects of performing decoding analyses on M/EEG data as well as the
limitations of the method, and then we discuss some applications for
understanding representational dynamics in the human brain.
