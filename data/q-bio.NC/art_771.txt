Noisy threshold in neuronal models: connections with the noisy leaky
  integrate-and-fire model
Providing an analytical treatment to the stochastic feature of neurons'
dynamics is one of the current biggest challenges in mathematical biology. The
noisy leaky integrate-and-fire model and its associated Fokker-Planck equation
are probably the most popular way to deal with neural variability. Another
well-known formalism is the escape-rate model: a model giving the probability
that a neuron fires at a certain time knowing the time elapsed since its last
action potential. This model leads to a so-called age-structured system, a
partial differential equation with non-local boundary condition famous in the
field of population dynamics, where the {\it age} of a neuron is the amount of
time passed by since its previous spike. In this theoretical paper, we
investigate the mathematical connection between the two formalisms. We shall
derive an integral transform of the solution to the age-structured model into
the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. This integral transform highlights
the link between the two stochastic processes. As far as we know, an explicit
mathematical correspondence between the two solutions has not been introduced
until now.
