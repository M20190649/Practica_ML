Heterogeneity in oscillator networks: Are smaller worlds easier to
  synchronize?
Small-world and scale-free networks are known to be more easily synchronized
than regular lattices, which is usually attributed to the smaller network
distance between oscillators. Surprisingly, we find that networks with a
homogeneous distribution of connectivity are more synchronizable than
heterogeneous ones, even though the average network distance is larger. We
present numerical computations and analytical estimates on synchronizability of
the network in terms of its heterogeneity parameters. Our results suggest that
some degree of homogeneity is expected in naturally evolved structures, such as
neural networks, where synchronizability is desirable.
