A toy model of the brain
We have designed a toy brain and have written computer code that simulates
it. This toy brain is flexible, modular, has hierarchical learning and
recognition, has short and long term memory, is distributed (i.e. has no
central control), is asynchronous, and includes parallel and series processing.
We have simulated the neurons calculating their internal voltages as a function
of time. We include in the simulation the ion pumps of the neurons, the
synapses with glutamate or GABA neurotransmitters, and the delays of the action
pulses in axons and dendrites. We have used known or plausible circuits of real
brains. The toy brain reads books and learns languages using the Hebb
mechanism. Finally, we have related the toy brain with what might be occurring
in a real brain.
