Sisyphus Effect in Pulse Coupled Excitatory Neural Networks with
  Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity
The collective dynamics of excitatory pulse coupled neural networks with
spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is studied. Depending on the model
parameters stationary states characterized by High or Low Synchronization can
be observed. In particular, at the transition between these two regimes,
persistent irregular low frequency oscillations between strongly and weakly
synchronized states are observable, which can be identified as infraslow
oscillations with frequencies 0.02 - 0.03 Hz. Their emergence can be explained
in terms of the Sisyphus Effect, a mechanism caused by a continuous feedback
between the evolution of the coherent population activity and of the average
synaptic weight. Due to this effect, the synaptic weights have oscillating
equilibrium values, which prevents the neuronal population from relaxing into a
stationary macroscopic state.
