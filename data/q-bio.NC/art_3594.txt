Building Brain Invaders: EEG data of an experimental validation
We describe the experimental procedures for a dataset that we have made
publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2649006 in mat and csv
formats. This dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 25
subjects testing the Brain Invaders (Congedo, 2011), a visual P300
Brain-Computer Interface inspired by the famous vintage video game Space
Invaders (Taito, Tokyo, Japan). The visual P300 is an event-related potential
elicited by a visual stimulation, peaking 240-600 ms after stimulus onset. EEG
data were recorded by 16 electrodes in an experiment that took place in the
GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France, in 2012 (Van Veen, 2013 and Congedo, 2013). Python
code for manipulating the data is available at
https://github.com/plcrodrigues/py.BI.EEG.2012-GIPSA. The ID of this dataset is
BI.EEG.2012-GIPSA.
