Making a swim central pattern generator out of latent parabolic bursters
We study the rhythmogenesis of oscillatory patterns emerging in network
motifs composed of inhibitory coupled tonic spiking neurons represented by the
Plant model of R15 nerve cells. Such motifs are argued to be used as building
blocks for a larger central pattern generator network controlling swim
locomotion of sea slug Melibe leonina.
