Effect of Activity and Inter-Cluster Correlations on
  Information-Theoretic Properties of Neural Networks
On the basis of solutions of the master equation for networks with a small
number of neurons it is shown that the conditional entropy and integrated
information of neural networks depend on their average activity and
inter-cluster correlations.
