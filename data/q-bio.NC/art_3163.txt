Observability and Synchronization of Neuron Models
Observability is the property that enables to distinguish two different
locations in $n$-dimensional state space from a reduced number of measured
variables, usually just one. In high-dimensional systems it is therefore
important to make sure that the variable recorded to perform the analysis
conveys good observability of the system dynamics. In the case of networks
composed of neuron models, the observability of the network depends
nontrivially on the observability of the node dynamics and on the topology of
the network. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, a study of observability
is conducted using four well-known neuron models by computing three different
observability coefficients. This not only clarifies observability properties of
the models but also shows the limitations of applicability of each type of
coefficients in the context of such models. Second, a multivariate singular
spectrum analysis (M-SSA) is performed to detect phase synchronization in
networks composed by neuron models. This tool, to the best of the authors'
knowledge has not been used in the context of networks of neuron models. It is
shown that it is possible to detect phase synchronization i)~without having to
measure all the state variables, but only one from each node, and ii)~without
having to estimate the phase.
