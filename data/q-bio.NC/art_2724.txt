Valid population inference for information-based imaging: From the
  second-level $t$-test to prevalence inference
In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, 'second-level'
inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a
$t$-test vs chance level across subjects. We argue that while the
random-effects analysis implemented by the $t$-test does provide population
inference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case
of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures, because the
true value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint
changes the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which
becomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any
subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that
there are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that
it generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis.
This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We
review possible alternative approaches to population inference for
information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the
mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,
'permutation-based information prevalence inference using the minimum
statistic', is described in detail and applied to empirical data.
