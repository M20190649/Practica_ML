Periodic solutions to a mean-field model for electrocortical activity
We consider a continuum model of electrical signals in the human cortex,
which takes the form of a system of semilinear, hyperbolic partial differential
equations for the inhibitory and excitatory membrane potentials and the
synaptic inputs. The coupling of these components is represented by sigmoidal
and quadratic nonlinearities. We consider these equations on a square domain
with periodic boundary conditions, in the vicinity of the primary transition
from a stable equilibrium to time-periodic motion through an equivariant Hopf
bifurcation. We compute part of a family of standing wave solutions, emanating
from this point.
