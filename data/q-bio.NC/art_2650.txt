Superchords: the atoms of thought
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals' interpretation is based on waveform
analysis, where meaningful information should emerge from a plethora of data.
Nonetheless, the continuous increase in computational power and the development
of new data processing algorithms in the recent years have put into reach the
possibility of analysing raw EEG signals. Bearing that motivation, the authors
propose a new approach using raw data EEG signals and deep learning neural
networks, for the classification of motor activities (executed and imagery).
The hypothesis to be presented here is: each instantaneous measurement of the
raw signal of all EEG channels (superchord) is unique per motor activity
regardless the moment of measurement. This study has confirmed the hypothesis
(results with accuracy over 80%, mean for 109 subjects), reinforcing the need
of further research for the understanding of mental processes.
