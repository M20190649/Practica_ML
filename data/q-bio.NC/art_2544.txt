Approximate discrete dynamics of EMG signal
Approximation of a continuous dynamics by discrete dynamics in the form of
Poincare map is one of the fascinating mathematical tool, which can describe
the approximate behaviour of the dynamics of the dynamical system in lesser
dimension than the embedding diemnsion. The present article considers a very
rare biomedical signal like Electromyography (EMG) signal. It determines
suitable time delay and reconstruct the attractor of embedding diemnsion three.
By measuring its Lyapunov exponent, the attractor so reconstructed is found to
be chaotic. Naturally the Poincare map obtained by corresponding Poincare
section is to be chaotic too. This may be verified by calculation of Lyapunov
exponent of the map. The main objective of this article is to show that
Poincare map exists in this case as a 2D map for a suitable Poincare section
only. In fact, the article considers two Poincare sections of the attractor for
construction of the Poincare map. It is seen that one such map is chaotic but
the other one is not so, both are verified by calculation of Lyapunov exponent
of the map.
