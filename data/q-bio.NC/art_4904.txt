Component response rate variation underlies the stability of complex
  systems
The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system
size and interconnectivity, a counterintuitive result of widespread importance
across the physical, life, and social sciences. Despite recent interest in the
relationship between system properties and stability, the effect of variation
in the response rate of individual system components remains unconsidered. Here
I vary the component response rates ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}$) of randomly
generated complex systems. I show that when component response rates vary, the
potential for system stability is markedly increased. Variation in
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is especially important for stability in highly complex
systems, in which the probability of stability would otherwise be negligible.
At such extremes of simulated system complexity, the largest stable complex
systems would be unstable if not for $\boldsymbol{Var(\gamma)}$. My results
therefore reveal a previously unconsidered aspect of system stability that is
likely to be pervasive across all realistic complex systems.
