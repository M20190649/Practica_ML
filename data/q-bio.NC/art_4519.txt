Ubiquity of collective irregular dynamics in balanced networks of
  spiking neurons
We revisit the dynamics of a prototypical model of balanced activity in
networks of spiking neutrons. A detailed investigation of the thermodynamic
limit for fixed density of connections (massive coupling) shows that, when
inhibition prevails, the asymptotic regime is not asynchronous but rather
characterized by a self-sustained irregular, macroscopic (collective) dynamics.
So long as the connectivity is massive, this regime is found in many different
setups: leaky as well as quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons; large and small
coupling strength; weak and strong external currents.
