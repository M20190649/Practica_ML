Three-dimensional network of Drosophila brain hemisphere
The first step to understanding brain function is to determine the brain's
network structure. We report a three-dimensional analysis of the brain network
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster by synchrotron-radiation tomographic
microscopy. A skeletonized wire model of the left half of the brain network was
built by tracing the three-dimensional distribution of X-ray absorption
coefficients. The obtained models of neuronal processes were classified into
groups on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. These classified
groups correspond to neuronal tracts that send long-range projections or
repeated structures of the optic lobe. The skeletonized model is also composed
of neuronal processes that could not be classified into the groups. The
distribution of these unclassified structures correlates with the distribution
of contacts between neuronal processes. This suggests that neurons that cannot
be classified into typical structures should play important roles in brain
functions. The quantitative description of the brain network provides a basis
for structural and statistical analyses of the Drosophila brain. The challenge
is to establish a methodology for reconstructing the brain network in a
higher-resolution image, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the brain
structure.
