Controllable Synchronization of Hierarchically Networked Oscillators
The controllability of synchronization is an intriguing question in complex
systems, in which hiearchically-organized heterogeneous elements have
asymmetric and activity-dependent couplings. In this study, we introduce a
simple and effective way to control synchronization in such a complex system by
changing the complexity of subsystems. We consider three Stuart-Landau
oscillators as a minimal subsystem for generating various complexity, and
hiearchically connect the subsystems through a mean field of their activities.
Depending on the coupling signs between three oscillators, subsystems can
generate ample dynamics, in which the number of attractors specify their
complexity. The degree of synchronization between subsystems is then
controllable by changing the complexity of subsystems. This controllable
synchronization can be applied to understand the synchronization behavior of
complex biological networks.
