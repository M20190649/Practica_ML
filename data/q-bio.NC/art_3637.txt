The BIDS Toolbox: A web service to manage brain imaging datasets
Data sharing is a key factor for ensuring reproducibility and transparency of
scientific experiments, and neuroimaging is no exception. The vast
heterogeneity of data formats and imaging modalities utilised in the field
makes it a very challenging problem. In this context, the Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS) appears as a solution for organising and describing
neuroimaging datasets. Since its publication in 2015, BIDS has gained
widespread attention in the field, as it provides a common way to arrange and
share multimodal brain images. Although the evident benefits it presents, BIDS
has not been widely adopted in the field of MRI yet and we believe that this is
due to the lack of a go-to tool to create and managed BIDS datasets. Motivated
by this, we present the BIDS Toolbox, a web service to manage brain imaging
datasets in BIDS format. Different from other tools, the BIDS Toolbox allows
the creation and modification of BIDS-compliant datasets based on MRI data. It
provides both a web interface and REST endpoints for its use. In this paper we
describe its design and early prototype, and provide a link to the public
source code repository.
