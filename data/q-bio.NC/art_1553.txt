Stochastic resonance in three-neuron motifs
Stochastic resonance is a non-linear phenomenon, in which the sensitivity of
signal detectors can be enhanced by adding random noise to the detector input.
Here, we demonstrate that noise can also improve the information flux in
recurrent neural networks. In particular, we show for the case of three-neuron
motifs that the mutual information between successive network states can be
maximized by adding a suitable amount of noise to the neuron inputs. This
striking result suggests that noise in the brain may not be a problem that
needs to be suppressed, but indeed a resource that is dynamically regulated in
order to optimize information processing.
