Predictive models of brain connectivity based on transportation on a
  Riemannian manifold
Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes
explores commonalities across multimodal imaging data. However, direct
application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical Correlation
Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional connectivity
across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted models of
functional connectivity are Symmetric Positive Matrices (SPD). We suggest an
elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity matrices on a
Riemannian manifold, which notably improves the prediction performance of the
model. Subsequently, we construct a statistical framework to highlight brain
connections that are selected with probability well above chance and we
estimate their sCCA loadings based on a de-noising approach.
