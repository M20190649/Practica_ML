Pain Detection with fNIRS-Measured Brain Signals: A Personalized Machine
  Learning Approach Using the Wavelet Transform and Bayesian Hierarchical
  Modeling with Dirichlet Process Priors
Currently self-report pain ratings are the gold standard in clinical pain
assessment. However, the development of objective automatic measures of pain
could substantially aid pain diagnosis and therapy. Recent neuroimaging studies
have shown the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for
pain detection. This is a brain-imaging technique that provides non-invasive,
long-term measurements of cortical hemoglobin concentration changes. In this
study, we focused on fNIRS signals acquired exclusively from the prefrontal
cortex, which can be accessed unobtrusively, and derived an algorithm for the
detection of the presence of pain using Bayesian hierarchical modelling with
wavelet features. This approach allows personalization of the inference process
by accounting for inter-participant variability in pain responses. Our work
highlights the importance of adopting a personalized approach and supports the
use of fNIRS for pain assessment.
