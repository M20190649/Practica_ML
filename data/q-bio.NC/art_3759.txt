Reliable and unreliable dynamics in driven coupled oscillators
This letter concerns the reliability of coupled oscillator networks in
response to fluctuating inputs. Reliability means that (following a transient)
an input elicits identical responses upon repeated presentations, regardless of
the system's initial condition. Here, we analyze this property for two coupled
oscillators, demonstrating that oscillator networks exhibit both reliable and
unreliable dynamics for broad ranges of coupling strengths. We further argue
that unreliable dynamics are characterized by strange attractors with random
SRB measures, implying that though unreliable, the responses lie on
low-dimensional sets. Finally, we show that 1:1 phase locking in the zero-input
system corresponds to high susceptibility for unreliable responses. A geometric
explanation is proposed.
