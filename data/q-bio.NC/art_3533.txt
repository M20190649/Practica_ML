Graph Spectral Characterization of Brain Cortical Morphology
The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral metrics derived from these graphs are then
studied and proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept
of their applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the metrics are
studied in the context of hemispheric asymmetry as well as gender dependent
discrimination of cortical morphology.
