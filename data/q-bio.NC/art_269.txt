Old equations for a new system: A possible use of Navier-Stokes
  equations to model the circulation of spikes in the nervous system
In the present work we discuss a possible application of Navier-Stokes-based
models to the quantitative description of the circulation of nervous impulses
throughout the nervous system. In previous works we have shown that the
discharge from Basal Ganglia neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease
share mathematical features with the velocity fields of fluids under turbulence
regimes. In the present work we try to build the fundaments for a physical
analogy between both kinds of systems.
