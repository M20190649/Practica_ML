Emergent regularities and scaling in armed conflict data
Large-scale armed conflict is a characteristic feature of modern societies.
The statistics of conflict show remarkable regularities like power law
distributions of fatalities and duration, but lack a unifying framework. We
explore a large, detailed data set of $10^5$ armed conflict reports spanning 20
years across nearly $10^4$ kilometers. By systematically clustering
spatiotemporally proximate events into conflict avalanches, we show that the
number of conflict reports, fatalities, duration, and geographic extent satisfy
consistent power law scaling relations. The temporal evolution of conflicts
measured by these scaling variables display emergent symmetry, collapsing onto
a universal dynamical profile over a range of scales. The measured exponents
and dynamical profiles describe a system distinct from prevailing explanations
of conflict growth such as forest fire models. Our findings suggest that armed
conflicts are dominated by a low-dimensional process that scales with physical
dimensions in a surprisingly unified and predictable way.
