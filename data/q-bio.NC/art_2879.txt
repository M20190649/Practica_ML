Online Discrimination of Nonlinear Dynamics with Switching Differential
  Equations
How to recognise whether an observed person walks or runs? We consider a
dynamic environment where observations (e.g. the posture of a person) are
caused by different dynamic processes (walking or running) which are active one
at a time and which may transition from one to another at any time. For this
setup, switching dynamic models have been suggested previously, mostly, for
linear and nonlinear dynamics in discrete time. Motivated by basic principles
of computations in the brain (dynamic, internal models) we suggest a model for
switching nonlinear differential equations. The switching process in the model
is implemented by a Hopfield network and we use parametric dynamic movement
primitives to represent arbitrary rhythmic motions. The model generates
observed dynamics by linearly interpolating the primitives weighted by the
switching variables and it is constructed such that standard filtering
algorithms can be applied. In two experiments with synthetic planar motion and
a human motion capture data set we show that inference with the unscented
Kalman filter can successfully discriminate several dynamic processes online.
