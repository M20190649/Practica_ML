The comparison of Higuchi fractal dimension and Sample Entropy analysis
  of sEMG: effects of muscle contraction intensity and TMS
The aim of the study was to examine how the complexity of surface
electromyogram (sEMG) signal, estimated by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
Sample Entropy (SampEn), change depending on muscle contraction intensity and
external perturbation of the corticospinal activity during muscle contraction
induced by single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (spTMS). HFD and
SampEn were computed from sEMG signal recorded at three various levels of
voluntary contraction before and after spTMS. After spTMS, both HFD and SampEn
decreased at medium compared to the mild contraction. SampEn increased, while
HFD did not change significantly at strong compared to medium contraction.
spTMS significantly decreased both parameters at all contraction levels. When
same parameters were computed from the mathematically generated sine-wave
calibration curves, the results show that SampEn has better accuracy at lower
(0-40 Hz) and HFD at higher (60-120 Hz) frequencies. Changes in the sEMG
complexity associated with increased muscle contraction intensity cannot be
accurately depicted by a single complexity measure. Examination of sEMG should
entail both SampEn and HFD as they provide complementary information about
different frequency components of sEMG. Further studies are needed to explain
the implication of changes in nonlinear parameters and their relation to
underlying sEMG physiological processes.
