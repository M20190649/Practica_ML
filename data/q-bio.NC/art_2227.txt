On Reverse Engineering in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences
Various research initiatives try to utilize the operational principles of
organisms and brains to develop alternative, biologically inspired computing
paradigms and artificial cognitive systems. This paper reviews key features of
the standard method applied to complexity in the cognitive and brain sciences,
i.e. decompositional analysis or reverse engineering. The indisputable
complexity of brain and mind raise the issue of whether they can be understood
by applying the standard method. Actually, recent findings in the experimental
and theoretical fields, question central assumptions and hypotheses made for
reverse engineering. Using the modeling relation as analyzed by Robert Rosen,
the scientific analysis method itself is made a subject of discussion. It is
concluded that the fundamental assumption of cognitive science, i.e. complex
cognitive systems can be analyzed, understood and duplicated by reverse
engineering, must be abandoned. Implications for investigations of organisms
and behavior as well as for engineering artificial cognitive systems are
discussed.
