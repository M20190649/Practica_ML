Brain on the 3D Visual Art through Virtual Reality; Introducing
  Neuro-Art in a Case Investigation
The reciprocal impact of applied neuroscience and cognitive studies on
humanities has been extensive and growing over the past 30 years of research.
Studies on neuroaesthetics have provided novel insights in visual arts, music
as well as abstract and dramatic art. Neuro-Art is an experimental concept in
applied neuroscience where scientists can study the mechanistic pathways
involved for instance in visual art through which creativity and artistic
capacity might receive further empowerment. Based on the existing evidence, at
least 3 large-scale brain networks are involved simultaneously when one is
submitted to a creativity-related task. The question whether the key brain
regions involved in visual art creativity can be identified and receive
neuromodulation to get empowered prompted us to perform the present case
investigation. Virtual reality and functional quantitative
electroencephalography upon 2- vs 3-dimentional painting were employed to study
cortical neurodynamics in a professional painting artist.
