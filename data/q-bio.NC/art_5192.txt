Spiking Neural Predictive Coding for Continual Learning from Data
  Streams
For energy-efficient computation in specialized neuromorphic hardware, we
present the Spiking Neural Coding Network, an instantiation of a family of
artificial neural models strongly motivated by the theory of predictive coding.
The model, in essence, works by operating in a never-ending process of
"guess-and-check", where neurons predict the activity values of one another and
then immediately adjust their own activities to make better future predictions.
The interactive, iterative nature of our neural system fits well into the
continuous time formulation of data sensory stream prediction and, as we show,
the model's structure yields a simple, local synaptic update rule, which could
be used to complement or replace online spike-timing dependent plasticity
rules. In this article, we experiment with an instantiation of our model that
consists of leaky integrate-and-fire units. However, the general framework
within which our model is situated can naturally incorporate more complex,
formal neurons such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our experimental results in
pattern recognition demonstrate the potential of the proposed model when binary
spike trains are the primary paradigm for inter-neuron communication. Notably,
our model is competitive in terms of classification performance, capable of
conducting online semi-supervised learning, and more computationally economical
and biologically-plausible than popular artificial neural networks.
