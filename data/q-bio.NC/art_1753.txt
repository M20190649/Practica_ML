Spike-Train Responses of a Pair of Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons with
  Time-Delayed Couplings
Model calculations have been performed on the spike-train response of a pair
of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons coupled by recurrent excitatory-excitatory
couplings with time delay. The coupled, excitable HH neurons are assumed to
receive the two kinds of spike-train inputs: the transient input consisting of
$M$ impulses for the finite duration ($M$: integer) and the sequential input
with the constant interspike interval (ISI). The distribution of the output ISI
$T_{\rm o}$ shows a rich of variety depending on the coupling strength and the
time delay. The comparison is made between the dependence of the output ISI for
the transient inputs and that for the sequential inputs.
