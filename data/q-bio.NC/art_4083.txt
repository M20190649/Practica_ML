Model of the Human Sleep Wake System
A model and analysis of the human sleep/wake system is presented. The model
is derived using the known neuronal groups, and their various projections,
involved with sleep and wake. Inherent in the derivation is the existence of a
slow time scale associated with homeostatic regulation, and a faster time scale
associated with the dynamics within the sleep phase. A significant feature of
the model is that it does not contain a periodic forcing term, common in other
models, reflecting the fact that sleep/wake is not dependent upon a diurnal
stimulus. Once derived, the model is analyzed using a linearized stability
analysis. We then use experimental data from normal sleep-wake systems and
orexin knockout systems to verify the physiological validity of the equations.
