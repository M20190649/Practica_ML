Three-dimensional alteration of neurites in schizophrenia
This paper reports nano-CT analysis of brain tissues of schizophrenia and
control cases. The analysis revealed that: (1) neuronal structures vary between
individuals, (2) the mean curvature of distal neurites of the schizophrenia
cases was 1.5 times higher than that of the controls, and (3) dendritic spines
were categorized into two geometrically distinctive groups, though no
structural differences were observed between the disease and control cases. The
differences in the neurite curvature result in differences in the spatial
trajectory and hence alter neuronal circuits. We suggest that the structural
alteration of neurons in the schizophrenia cases should reflect psychiatric
symptoms of schizophrenia.
