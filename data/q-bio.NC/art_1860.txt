Asymptotic construction of pulses in the Hodgkin Huxley model for
  myelinated nerves
A quantitative description of pulses and wave trains in the spatially
discrete Hodgkin-Huxley model for myelinated nerves is given. Predictions of
the shape and speed of the waves and the thresholds for propagation failure are
obtained. Our asymptotic predictions agree quite well with numerical solutions
of the model and describe wave patterns generated by repeated firing at a
boundary.
