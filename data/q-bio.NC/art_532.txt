Generalized cable formalism to calculate the magnetic field of single
  neurons and neuronal populations
Neurons generate magnetic fields which can be recorded with macroscopic
techniques such as magneto-encephalography. The theory that accounts for the
genesis of neuronal magnetic fields involves dendritic cable structures in
homogeneous resistive extracellular media. Here, we generalize this model by
considering dendritic cables in extracellular media with arbitrarily complex
electric properties. This method is based on a multi-scale mean-field theory
where the neuron is considered in interaction with a "mean" extracellular
medium (characterized by a specific impedance). We first show that, as
expected, the generalized cable equation and the standard cable generate
magnetic fields that mostly depend on the axial current in the cable, with a
moderate contribution of extracellular currents. Less expected, we also show
that the nature of the extracellular and intracellular media influence the
axial current, and thus also influence neuronal magnetic fields. We illustrate
these properties by numerical simulations and suggest experiments to test these
findings.
