When is an action caused from within? Quantifying the causal chain
  leading to actions in simulated agents
An agent's actions can be influenced by external factors through the inputs
it receives from the environment, as well as internal factors, such as memories
or intrinsic preferences. The extent to which an agent's actions are "caused
from within", as opposed to being externally driven, should depend on its
sensor capacity as well as environmental demands for memory and
context-dependent behavior. Here, we test this hypothesis using simulated
agents ("animats"), equipped with small adaptive Markov Brains (MB) that evolve
to solve a perceptual-categorization task under conditions varied with regards
to the agents' sensor capacity and task difficulty. Using a novel formalism
developed to identify and quantify the actual causes of occurrences ("what
caused what?") in complex networks, we evaluate the direct causes of the
animats' actions. In addition, we extend this framework to trace the causal
chain ("causes of causes") leading to an animat's actions back in time, and
compare the obtained spatio-temporal causal history across task conditions. We
found that measures quantifying the extent to which an animat's actions are
caused by internal factors (as opposed to being driven by the environment
through its sensors) varied consistently with defining aspects of the task
conditions they evolved to thrive in.
