Modeling the ballistic-to-diffusive transition in nematode motility
  reveals variation in exploratory behavior across species
A quantitative understanding of organism-level behavior requires predictive
models that can capture the richness of behavioral phenotypes, yet are simple
enough to connect with underlying mechanistic processes. Here we investigate
the motile behavior of nematodes at the level of their translational motion on
surfaces driven by undulatory propulsion. We broadly sample the nematode
behavioral repertoire by measuring motile trajectories of the canonical lab
strain $C. elegans$ N2 as well as wild strains and distant species. We focus on
trajectory dynamics over timescales spanning the transition from ballistic
(straight) to diffusive (random) movement and find that salient features of the
motility statistics are captured by a random walk model with independent
dynamics in the speed, bearing and reversal events. We show that the model
parameters vary among species in a correlated, low-dimensional manner
suggestive of a common mode of behavioral control and a trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. The distribution of phenotypes along this primary
mode of variation reveals that not only the mean but also the variance varies
considerably across strains, suggesting that these nematode lineages employ
contrasting ``bet-hedging'' strategies for foraging.
