Optimal Region of Latching Activity in an Adaptive Potts Model for
  Networks of Neurons
In statistical mechanics, the Potts model is a model for interacting spins
with more than two discrete states. Neural networks which exhibit features of
learning and associative memory can also be modeled by a system of Potts spins.
A spontaneous behavior of hopping from one discrete attractor state to another
(referred to as latching) has been proposed to be associated with higher
cognitive functions. Here we propose a model in which both the stochastic
dynamics of Potts models and an adaptive potential function are present. A
latching dynamics is observed in a limited region of the
noise(temperature)-adaptation parameter space. We hence suggest noise as a
fundamental factor in such alternations alongside adaptation. From a dynamical
systems point of view, the noise-adaptation alternations may be the underlying
mechanism for multi-stability in attractor based models. An optimality
criterion for realistic models is finally inferred.
