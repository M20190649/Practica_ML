Functional Imaging of Conceptual Representations
A concept is a mental representation that encompasses multiple aspects of an
item, but what is the neurological substrate of this representation? One
hypothesis states that such representations depend upon multimodal binding
processes within a single region. Convergent evidence suggests that such a
region may exist within the temporal lobe(see Patterson 2007). To test these
hypotheses we utilized two established paradigms, behavioral priming and
physiological suppression, to examine response to the repetition of concepts
across perceptual modalities.
  Typically, examinations of the relationship between behavioral priming and
suppression have queried the extent to which suppression effects in different
brain regions correlate with single measures of behavioral priming. In
contrast, we were interested in the extent to which suppression effects within
a single brain region would correlate with multiple measures of behavioral
priming. While many sensory regions show suppression effects to specific
perceptual repetitions, we hypothesized that a region engaged in conceptual
representation would show suppression effects to conceptual repetitions, even
when the stimuli were perceptually distinct.
  Using BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) data, we determined that
suppression effects in perirhinal cortex, a temporal lobe region, significantly
correlate with behavioral priming in a multimodal manner. This result provides
evidence that perirhinal cortex is engaged in conceptual representation.
