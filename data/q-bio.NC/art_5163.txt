Representing Attitudes Towards Ambiguity in Managerial Decisions
We provide here a general mathematical framework to model attitudes towards
ambiguity which uses the formalism of quantum theory as a "purely mathematical
formalism, detached from any physical interpretation". We show that the
quantum-theoretic framework enables modelling of the "Ellsberg paradox", but it
also successfully applies to more concrete human decision-making (DM) tests
involving financial, managerial and medical decisions. In particular, we
provide a faithful mathematical representation of various empirical studies
which reveal that attitudes of managers towards uncertainty shift from
"ambiguity seeking" to "ambiguity aversion", and viceversa, thus exhibiting
"hope effects" and "fear effects" in management decisions. The present
framework provides a new bold and promising direction towards the development
of a unified theory of decisions in the presence of uncertainty.
