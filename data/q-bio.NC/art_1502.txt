The Moon Illusion explained by the Projective Consciousness Model
The Moon often appears larger near the perceptual horizon and smaller high in
the sky though the visual angle subtended is invariant. We show how this
illusion results from the optimization of a projective geometrical frame for
conscious perception through free energy minimization, as articulated in the
Projective Consciousness Model. The model accounts for all documented
modulations of the illusion without anomalies (e.g., the size-distance
paradox), surpasses other theories in explanatory power, makes sense of inter-
and intra-subjective variability vis-a-vis the illusion, and yields new
quantitative and qualitative predictions.
