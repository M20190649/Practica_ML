Stimulus sensitivity of a spiking neural network model
Some recent papers relate the criticality of complex systems to their maximal
capacity of information processing. In the present paper, we consider high
dimensional point processes, known as age-dependent Hawkes processes, which
have been used to model spiking neural networks. Using mean-field
approximation, the response of the network to a stimulus is computed and we
provide a notion of stimulus sensitivity. It appears that the maximal
sensitivity is achieved in the sub-critical regime, yet almost critical for a
range of biologically relevant parameters.
