What can neuronal populations tell us about cognition?
Nowadays, it is possible to record the activity of hundreds of cells at the
same time in behaving animals. However, these data are often treated and
analyzed as if they consisted of many independently recorded neurons. How can
neuronal populations be uniquely used to learn about cognition? We describe
recent work that shows that populations of simultaneously recorded neurons are
fundamental to understand the basis of decision-making, including processes
such as ongoing deliberations and decision confidence, which generally fall
outside the reach of single-cell analysis. Thus, neuronal population data allow
addressing novel questions, but they also come with so far unsolved challenges.
