Consciousness: From the Perspective of the Dynamical Systems Theory
Beings, animate or inanimate, are dynamical systems which continuously
interact with the (external and /or internal) environment through the physical
or physiologic interfaces of their Kantian (representational) realities. And
the nature of their interactions is determined by the inner workings of their
systems. It is from this perspective that this work attempts to address some of
the long-held philosophical questions, major one among them consciousness-- in
the context of the physicality of the dynamic systems.
