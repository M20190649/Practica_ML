The Geometry of Rest-Spike Bistability
The Morris-Lecar model is arguably the simplest dynamical model that retains
both the slow-fast geometry of excitable phase portraits and the physiological
interpretation of a conductance-based model. We augment this model with one
slow inward current to capture the additional property of bistability between a
resting state and a spiking limit cycle. The resulting dynamical system is a
core structure for many dynamical phenomena such as slow spiking and bursting.
We show how the proposed model combines physiological interpretation and
mathematical tractability and we discuss the benefits of the proposed approach
with respect to alternative models in the literature.
