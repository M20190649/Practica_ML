Neurobiological reality simulation through an Artificial Neural Network
  at criticality
An artificial neural network (ANN) based on fundamental principles of physics
can simulate the operation of neurobiological reality of membrane potential as
well as the properly defined order parameter. This ANN operates in conditions
of criticality and simulates the behavior of an excitatory biological neuron,
especially the relaxation phase where the critical fluctuations of biological
neuron appear. These critical fluctuations can not be explained by the
Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) model. A proposal for the origin of these fluctuations is
being discussed.
