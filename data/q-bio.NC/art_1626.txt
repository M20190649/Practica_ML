A causal role of sensory cortices in behavioral benefits of 'learning by
  doing'
Despite a rise in the use of "learning by doing" pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.
