Angular Velocity Estimation of Image Motion Mimicking the Honeybee
  Tunnel Centring Behaviour
Insects use visual information to estimate angular velocity of retinal image
motion, which determines a variety of flight behaviours including speed
regulation, tunnel centring and visual navigation. For angular velocity
estimation, honeybees show large spatial-independence against visual stimuli,
whereas the previous models have not fulfilled such an ability. To address this
issue, we propose a bio-plausible model for estimating the image motion
velocity based on behavioural experiments of the honeybee flying through
patterned tunnels. The proposed model contains mainly three parts, the texture
estimation layer for spatial information extraction, the delay-and-correlate
layer for temporal information extraction and the decoding layer for angular
velocity estimation. This model produces responses that are largely independent
of the spatial frequency in grating experiments. And the model has been
implemented in a virtual bee for tunnel centring simulations. The results
coincide with both electro-physiological neuron spike and behavioural path
recordings, which indicates our proposed method provides a better explanation
of the honeybee's image motion detection mechanism guiding the tunnel centring
behaviour.
