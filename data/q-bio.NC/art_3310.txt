A mechanistic model of connector hubs, modularity, and cognition
The human brain network is modular--comprised of communities of tightly
interconnected nodes. This network contains local hubs, which have many
connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have
connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic
understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been
demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and
cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the
cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover,
there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive
performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular
brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task.
Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which
connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular
while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities,
which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.
