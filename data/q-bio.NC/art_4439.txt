The connected brain: Causality, models and intrinsic dynamics
Recently, there have been several concerted international efforts - the BRAIN
initiative, European Human Brain Project and the Human Connectome Project, to
name a few - that hope to revolutionize our understanding of the connected
brain. Over the past two decades, functional neuroimaging has emerged as the
predominant technique in systems neuroscience. This is foreshadowed by an ever
increasing number of publications on functional connectivity, causal modeling,
connectomics, and multivariate analyses of distributed patterns of brain
responses. In this article, we summarize pedagogically the (deep) history of
brain mapping. We will highlight the theoretical advances made in the (dynamic)
causal modelling of brain function - that may have escaped the wider audience
of this article - and provide a brief overview of recent developments and
interesting clinical applications. We hope that this article will engage the
signal processing community by showcasing the inherently multidisciplinary
nature of this important topic and the intriguing questions that are being
addressed.
