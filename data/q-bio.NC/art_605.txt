The Self-Organization of Grid Cells in 3D
What sort of grid cells do we expect to see in bats exploring a
three-dimensional environment? How long will it take for them to emerge? We
address these questions within our self-organization model based on firing-rate
adaptation. The model indicates that the answer to the first question may be
simple, and to the second one rather complex. The mathematical analysis of the
simplified version of the model points at asymptotic states resembling FCC and
HCP crystal structures, which are calculated to be very close to each other in
terms of cost function. The simulation of the full model, however, shows that
the approach to such asymptotic states involves several sub-processes over
distinct time scales. The smoothing of the initially irregular multiple fields
of individual units and their arrangement into hexagonal grids over certain
best planes are observed to occur relatively fast, even in large 3D volumes.
The correct mutual orientation of the planes, however, and the coordinated
arrangement of different units, take a longer time, with the network showing no
sign of convergence towards either a pure FCC or HCP ordering.
