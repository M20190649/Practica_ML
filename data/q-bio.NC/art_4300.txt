Fluctuation-response Relation Unifies Dynamical Behaviors in Neural
  Fields
Anticipation is a strategy used by neural fields to compensate for
transmission and processing delays during the tracking of dynamical
information, and can be achieved by slow, localized, inhibitory feedback
mechanisms such as short-term synaptic depression, spike-frequency adaptation,
or inhibitory feedback from other layers. Based on the translational symmetry
of the mobile network states, we derive generic fluctuation-response relations,
providing unified predictions that link their tracking behaviors in the
presence of external stimuli to the intrinsic dynamics of the neural fields in
their absence.
