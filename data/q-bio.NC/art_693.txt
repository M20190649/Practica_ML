Dendritic Integration Regulation and Neuronal Arithmetic Implemented in
  a Proton-Coupled Neuron Transistor
Neuron is the most important building block in our brain, and information
processing in individual neuron involves the transformation of input synaptic
spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Hardware implementation of
neuron by individual ionic/electronic coupled device is of great importance for
enhancing our understanding of the brain and solving sensory processing and
complex recognition tasks. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle artificial
neuron with multiple presynaptic inputs and one modulatory terminal based on a
proton-coupled oxide-based electric-double-layer transistor. Regulation of
dendritic integration was realized by tuning the voltage applied on the
modulatory terminal. Additionally, neuronal gain control (arithmetic) in the
scheme of temporal-correlated coding and rate coding are also mimicked. Our
results provide a new-concept approach for building brain-inspired neuromorphic
systems.
