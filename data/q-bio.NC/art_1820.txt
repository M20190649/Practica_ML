Do reductionist cures select for holistic diseases? Adaptive chronic
  infection, structured stress, and medical magic bullets
With a generalized language-of-thought argument for immune cognition, we
model how population-directed structured psychosocial stress can impose an
image of itself on the coevolutionary conflict between a highly adaptive
chronic infection and the immune system. We raise the possibility that, for
successful 'evolution machines' like HIV and malaria, simplistic
individual-oriented magic bullet drug treatments, vaccines, behavior
modification, or other interventions that do not address the fundamental living
and working conditions underlying disease ecology will fail to control current
epidemics and may select for holistic pathogenic life histories which increase
disease virulence.
