Geometric renormalization unravels self-similarity of the multiscale
  human connectome
Structural connectivity in the brain is typically studied by reducing its
observation to a single spatial resolution. However, the brain poses a rich
architecture organized in multiple scales linked to one another. We explored
the multiscale organization of the human connectome using a dataset of healthy
subjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We find that the
structure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution length is
progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the anatomical
regions. Strikingly, geometric renormalization of connectome maps in hyperbolic
space, which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and averaging over
short similarity distances, predicts the properties of connectomes including
self-similarity. Our results suggest that the same principles regulate
connectivity between brain regions at different length scales and that the
multiscale self-similarity of brain connectomes may offer an advantageous
architecture for navigation purposes. The implications are varied and can
affect fundamental debates, like whether the brain is working near a critical
point, and lead to applications including advanced tools to simplify the
digital reconstruction and simulation of the brain.
