A hybrid model for large neural network description
The aim of the present paper is to efficiently describe the membrane
potential dynamics of neural populations formed by species having a high
density difference in specific brain areas. We propose a hybrid model whose
main ingredients are a conductance-based model (ODE system) and its continuous
counterpart (PDE system) obtained through a limit process in which the number
of neurons confined in a bounded region of the brain is sent to infinity.
Specifically, in the discrete model each cell of the low-density populations is
individually described by a set of time-dependent variables, whereas in the
continuum model the high-density populations are described as a whole by a
small set of continuous variables depending on space and time. Communications
among populations, which translate into interactions among the discrete and the
continuous models, are the essence of the hybrid model we present here. Such an
approach has been validated reconstructing the ensemble activity of the
granular layer network of the Cerebellum, leading to a computational cost
reduction. The hybrid model reproduced interesting dynamics such as local
microcircuit synchronization, travelling waves, center-surround and
time-windowing.
