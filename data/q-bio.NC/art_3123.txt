Detecting causality in Plant electrical signal by a hybrid causal
  analysis approach
At present, multi-electrode array (MEA) approach and optical recording allow
us to acquire plant electrical activity with higher spatio-temporal resolution.
To understand the dynamic information flow of the electrical signaling system
and estimate the effective connectivity, we proposed a solution to combine the
two casualty analysis approaches, i.e. Granger causality and transfer entropy,
which they complement each other to measure dynamics effective connectivity of
the complex system. Our findings in three qualitatively different levels of
plant bioelectrical activities revealed direction of information flow and
dynamic complex causal connectives by using the two causal analysis approaches,
especially indicated that the direction of information flow is not only along
the longitudinal section but also spreading in transection.
