Physics of the Brain-Schizophrenia
Schizophrenic patients suffer from hallucination which its causality is not
yet fully understood. This paper attempts to approach this mystery from the
perspective of quantum mechanical theories. A novel approach has been adopted
to demonstrate the hallucination as a time evolution of percepts basis states
in the Hilbertian consciousness which are desynchronised from the time in real
world. The method also extends his approach to predict mind and brain
modulation through the correlation and coupling of consciousness and it reaches
a clinically hypothetical outcome of inducing consciousness into a brain which
is not conscious.
