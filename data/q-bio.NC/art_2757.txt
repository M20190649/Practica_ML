A Langevin model for complex cardiological time series
There has been considerable efforts to understand the underlying complex
dynamics in physiological time series. Methods originated from statistical
physics revealed a non-Gaussian statistics and long range correlations in those
signals. This suggests that the regulatory system operates out of equilibrium.
Herein the complex fluctuations in blood pressure time series were successful
described by physiological motivated Langevin equation under a sigmoid
restoring force with multiplicative noise.
