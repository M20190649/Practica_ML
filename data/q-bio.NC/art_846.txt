Wavelet algorithm for the identification of P300 ERP component
Brain-computer interfaces have many algorithms based on the P300 component of
ERP. Modern industry has started to produce consumer grade EEG equipment which
is handy and not too expensive. This gives us an opportunity to use BCI in
everyday practice. In order to improve the performance of these devices, we
need effective algorithms for time series analysis and pattern recognition. We
have tested Emotiv Insight headset in a real live environment and we have
conducted several tests for series of standard wavelets in P300 pattern
recognition task.
