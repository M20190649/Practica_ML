Conserved Ising Model on the Human Connectome
Dynamical models implemented on the large scale architecture of the human
brain may shed light on how function arises from the underlying structure. This
is the case notably for simple abstract models, such as the Ising model. We
compare the spin correlations of the Ising model and the empirical functional
brain correlations, both at the single link level and at the modular level, and
show that their match increases at the modular level in anesthesia, in line
with recent results and theories. Moreover, we show that at the peak of the
specific heat (the \it{critical state}) the spin correlations are minimally
shaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match
between structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as
previously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under
anesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel
perspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of an
homeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.
