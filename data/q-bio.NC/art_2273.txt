In-phase and anti-phase synchronization in noisy Hodgkin-Huxley neurons
We numerically investigate the influence of intrinsic channel noise on the
dynamical response of delay-coupling in neuronal systems. The stochastic
dynamics of the spiking is modeled within a stochastic modification of the
standard Hodgkin-Huxley model wherein the delay-coupling accounts for the
finite propagation time of an action potential along the neuronal axon. We
quantify this delay-coupling of the Pyragas-type in terms of the difference
between corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane potentials. For an
elementary neuronal network consisting of two coupled neurons we detect
characteristic stochastic synchronization patterns which exhibit multiple
phase-flip bifurcations: The phase-flip bifurcations occur in form of alternate
transitions from an in-phase spiking activity towards an anti-phase spiking
activity. Interestingly, these phase-flips remain robust in strong channel
noise and in turn cause a striking stabilization of the spiking frequency.
