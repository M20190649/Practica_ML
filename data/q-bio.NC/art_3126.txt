Seeds Cleansing CNMF for Spatiotemporal Neural Signals Extraction of
  Miniscope Imaging Data
Miniscope calcium imaging is increasingly being used to monitor large
populations of neuronal activities in freely behaving animals. However, due to
the high background and low signal-to-noise ratio of the single-photon based
imaging used in this technique, extraction of neural signals from the large
numbers of imaged cells automatically has remained challenging. Here we
describe a highly accurate framework for automatically identifying activated
neurons and extracting calcium signals from the miniscope imaging data, seeds
cleansing Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (sc-CNMF). This sc-CNMF
extends the conventional CNMF with two new modules: i) a neural enhancing
module to overcome miniscope-specific limitations, and ii) a seeds cleansing
module combining LSTM to rigorously select and cleanse the set of seeds for
detecting regions-of-interest. Our sc-CNMF yields highly stable and superior
performance in analyzing miniscope calcium imaging data compared to existing
methods.
