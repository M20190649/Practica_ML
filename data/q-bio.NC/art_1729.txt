Firing rate homeostasis counteracts changes in stability of recurrent
  neural networks caused by synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease
The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer's is clearly correlated to
synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only
poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in
sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons
alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the network's
activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory
neurons shifts the network dynamic towards the stable regime. The decrease in
sensitivity to small perturbations to time varying input can be considered as
an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the
network performance can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here
implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses.
By analysing the stability of the linearized network dynamics, we explain how
homeostasis can simultaneously maintain the network's firing rate and
sensitivity to small perturbations.
