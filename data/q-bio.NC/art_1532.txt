Concerning the Neural Code
The central problem with understanding brain and mind is the neural code
issue: understanding the matter of our brain as basis for the phenomena of our
mind. The richness with which our mind represents our environment, the
parsimony of genetic data, the tremendous efficiency with which the brain
learns from scant sensory input and the creativity with which our mind
constructs mental worlds all speak in favor of mind as an emergent phenomenon.
This raises the further issue of how the neural code supports these processes
of organization. The central point of this communication is that the neural
code has the form of structured net fragments that are formed by network
self-organization, activate and de-activate on the functional time scale, and
spontaneously combine to form larger nets with the same basic structure.
