A Computational Model of Systems Memory Consolidation and
  Reconsolidation
In the mammalian brain, newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for
maintenance and recall, but over time the neocortex takes over these functions,
rendering memories hippocampus-independent. The process responsible for this
transformation is called systems memory consolidation. However, reactivation of
a well-consolidated memory can trigger a temporary return to a
hippocampus-dependent state, a phenomenon known as systems memory
reconsolidation. The neural mechanisms underlying systems memory consolidation
and reconsolidation are not well understood. Here, we propose a neural model
based on well-documented mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and stability and
describe a computational implementation that demonstrates the model's ability
to account for a range of findings from the systems consolidation and
reconsolidation literature. We derive several predictions from the
computational model, and suggest experiments that may put them to the test.
