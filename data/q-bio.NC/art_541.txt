Induction of slow oscillations by rhythmic acoustic stimulation
Slow oscillations are electrical potential oscillations with a spectral peak
frequency of $\sim$0.8 Hz, and hallmark the electroencephalogram during
slow-wave sleep. Recent studies have indicated a causal contribution of slow
oscillations to the consolidation of memories during slow-wave sleep, raising
the question to what extent such oscillations can be induced by external
stimulation. Here, we examined whether slow oscillations can be effectively
induced by rhythmic acoustic stimulation. Human subjects were examined in three
conditions: (i) with tones presented at a rate of 0.8 Hz (`0.8-Hz
stimulation'); (ii) with tones presented at a random sequence (`random
stimulation'); and (iii) with no tones presented in a control condition
(`sham'). Stimulation started during wakefulness before sleep and continued for
the first $\sim$90 min of sleep. Compared with the other two conditions, 0.8-Hz
stimulation significantly delayed sleep onset. However, once sleep was
established, 0.8-Hz stimulation significantly increased and entrained
endogenous slow oscillation activity. Sleep after the 90-min period of
stimulation did not differ between the conditions. Our data show that rhythmic
acoustic stimulation can be used to effectively enhance slow oscillation
activity. However, the effect depends on the brain state, requiring the
presence of stable non-rapid eye movement sleep.
