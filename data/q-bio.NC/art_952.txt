Common Connectome Constraints: From C. elegans and Drosophila to Homo
  sapiens
Neural systems show a modular and typically also a hierarchical organisation
across different levels and across different species. Topology relates to
function, but it is also influences dynamics as earlier studies showed its
effect on synchrony, oscillation, and activity propagation. Understanding the
link between the hierarchical organisation and processing (e.g. does
consciousness structurally correlate with the top level of the hierarchy and
where is the 'top' in a network?) remains one of the main challenges of the
field. In addition, although neuron nodes are often treated as uniform
entities, they can differ in terms of function (e.g. inhibitory vs.
excitatory), morphology, or gene expression pattern.
