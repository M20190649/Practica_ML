Quickly fading afterimages: hierarchical adaptations in human perception
Afterimages result from a prolonged exposure to still visual stimuli. They
are best detectable when viewed against uniform backgrounds and can persist for
multiple seconds. Consequently, the dynamics of afterimages appears to be slow
by their very nature. To the contrary, we report here that about 50% of an
afterimage intensity can be erased rapidly--within less than a second. The
prerequisite is that subjects view a rich visual content to erase the
afterimage; fast erasure of afterimages does not occur if subjects view a blank
screen. Moreover, we find evidence that fast removal of afterimages is a skill
learned with practice as our subjects were always more effective in cleaning up
afterimages in later parts of the experiment. These results can be explained by
a tri-level hierarchy of adaptive mechanisms, as has been proposed by the
theory of practopoiesis.
