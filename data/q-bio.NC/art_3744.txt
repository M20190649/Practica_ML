A propensity criterion for networking in an array of coupled chaotic
  systems
We examine the mutual synchronization of a one dimensional chain of chaotic
identical objects in the presence of a stimulus applied to the first site. We
first describe the characteristics of the local elements, and then the process
whereby a global nontrivial behaviour emerges. A propensity criterion for
networking is introduced, consisting in the coexistence within the attractor of
a localized chaotic region, which displays high sensitivity to external
stimuli,and an island of stability, which provides a reliable coupling signal
to the neighbors in the chain. Based on this criterion we compare homoclinic
chaos, recently explored in lasers and conjectured to be typical of a single
neuron, with Lorenz chaos.
