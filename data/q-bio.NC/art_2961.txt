From quasiperiodic partial synchronization to collective chaos in
  populations of inhibitory neurons with delay
Collective chaos is shown to emerge, via a period-doubling cascade, from
quasiperiodic partial synchronization in a population of identical inhibitory
neurons with delayed global coupling. This system is thoroughly investigated by
means of an exact model of the macroscopic dynamics, valid in the thermodynamic
limit. The collective chaotic state is reproduced numerically with a finite
population, and persists in the presence of weak heterogeneities. Finally, the
relationship of the model's dynamics with fast neuronal oscillations is
discussed.
