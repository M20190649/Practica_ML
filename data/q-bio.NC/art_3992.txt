Algorithmic choice of coordinates for injections into the brain:
  encoding a neuroanatomical atlas on a grid
Given an atlas of the brain and a number of injections to be performed in
order to map out the connections between parts of the brain, we propose an
algorithm to compute the coordinates of the injections. The algorithm is
designed to sample the brain in the most homogeneous way compatible with the
separation of brain regions. It can be applied to other species for which a
neuroanatomical atlas is available. The computation is tested on the annotation
at a resolution of 25 microns corresponding to the Allen Reference Atlas, which
is hierarchical and consists of 209 regions. The resulting injection
coordinates are being used for the injection protocol of the Mouse Brain
Architecture project. Due to its large size and layered structure, the cerebral
cortex is treated in a separate algorithm, which is more adapted to its
geometry.
