Classification of EEG recordings in auditory brain activity via a
  logistic functional linear regression model
We want to analyse EEG recordings in order to investigate the phonemic
categorization at a very early stage of auditory processing. This problem can
be modelled by a supervised classification of functional data. Discrimination
is explored via a logistic functional linear model, using a wavelet
representation of the data. Different procedures are investigated, based on
penalized likelihood and principal component reduction or partial least squares
reduction.
