Reinforcing the Resilience of Complex Networks
Given a connected network, it can be augmented by applying a growing strategy
(e.g. random or scale-free rules) over the previously existing structure.
Another approach for augmentation, recently introduced, involves incorporating
a direct edge between any two nodes which are found to be connected through at
least one self-avoiding path of length L. This work investigates the resilience
of random and scale-free models augmented by using the three schemes identified
above. Considering random and scale-free networks, their giant cluster are
identified and reinforced, then the resilience of the resulting networks with
respect to highest degree node attack is quantified through simulations. The
results, which indicate that substantial reinforcement of the resilience of
complex networks can be achieved by the expansions, also confirm the superior
robustness of the random expansion.
