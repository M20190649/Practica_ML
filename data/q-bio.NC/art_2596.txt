Hemodynamically informed parcellation of cerebral FMRI data
Standard detection of evoked brain activity in functional MRI (fMRI) relies
on a fixed and known shape of the impulse response of the neurovascular
coupling, namely the hemodynamic response function (HRF). To cope with this
issue, the joint detection-estimation (JDE) framework has been proposed. This
formalism enables to estimate a HRF per region but for doing so, it assumes a
prior brain partition (or parcellation) regarding hemodynamic territories. This
partition has to be accurate enough to recover accurate HRF shapes but has also
to overcome the detection-estimation issue: the lack of hemodynamics
information in the non-active positions. An hemodynamically-based parcellation
method is proposed, consisting first of a feature extraction step, followed by
a Gaussian Mixture-based parcellation, which considers the injection of the
activation levels in the parcellation process, in order to overcome the
detection-estimation issue and find the underlying hemodynamics.
