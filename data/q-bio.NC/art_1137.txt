Network Analyses and Nervous System Disorders
Network analyses in nervous system disorders involves constructing and
analyzing anatomical and functional brain networks from neuroimaging data to
describe and predict the clinical syndromes that result from neuropathology. A
network view of neurological disease and clinical syndromes facilitates
accurate quantitative characterizations and mathematical models of complex
nervous system disorders with relatively simple tools drawn from the field of
graph theory. Networks are predominantly constructed from in vivo data acquired
using physiological and neuroimaging techniques at the macroscale of nervous
system organization. Studies support the emerging view that neuropsychiatric
and neurological disorders result from pathological processes that disrupt the
brain's economically wired small-world organization. The lens of network
science offers theoretical insight into progressive neurodegeneration,
neuropsychological dysfunction, and potential anatomical targets for
intervensions ranging form pharmacological agents to brain stimulation.
