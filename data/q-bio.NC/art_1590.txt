Postoperative brain volumes are associated with one-year
  neurodevelopmental outcome in children with severe congenital heart disease
Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for
neurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care.
Our prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between
perioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with
severe CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born
neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain
volumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year
outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and
postoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all
p<0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p<=0.0001) and a
trend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The
total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and
language outcome (all p<0.04). This association was independent of length of
intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar
volumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and
postoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes
predict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in
CHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.
