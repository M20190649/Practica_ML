Clustering Time Series with Nonlinear Dynamics: A Bayesian
  Non-Parametric and Particle-Based Approach
We propose a general statistical framework for clustering multiple time
series that exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of
sub-groups. Our motivation comes from neuroscience, where an important problem
is to identify, within a large assembly of neurons, subsets that respond
similarly to a stimulus or contingency. Upon modeling the multiple time series
as the output of a Dirichlet process mixture of nonlinear state-space models,
we derive a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for full Bayesian inference that
alternates between sampling cluster assignments and sampling parameter values
that form the basis of the clustering. The Metropolis step employs recent
innovations in particle-based methods. We apply the framework to clustering
time series acquired from the prefrontal cortex of mice in an experiment
designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of fear.
