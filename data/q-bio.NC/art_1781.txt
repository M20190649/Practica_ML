Does dynamics reflect topology in directed networks?
We present and analyze a topologically induced transition from ordered,
synchronized to disordered dynamics in directed networks of oscillators. The
analysis reveals where in the space of networks this transition occurs and its
underlying mechanisms. If disordered, the dynamics of the units is precisely
determined by the topology of the network and thus characteristic for it. We
develop a method to predict the disordered dynamics from topology. The results
suggest a new route towards understanding how the precise dynamics of the units
of a directed network may encode information about its topology.
