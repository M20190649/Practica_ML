The right time to learn: mechanisms and optimization of spaced learning
For many types of learning, spaced training that involves repeated long
inter-trial intervals (ITIs) leads to more robust memory formation than does
massed training that involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories
have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently has data
begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced
training. We review these theories and data here. Computational models of the
implicated signaling cascades have predicted that spaced training with
irregular ITIs can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict
optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests
novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.
