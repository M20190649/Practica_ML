Gap junction plasticity can lead to spindle oscillations
Patterns of waxing and waning oscillations, called spindles, are observed in
multiple brain regions during sleep. Spindle are thought to be involved in
memory consolidation. The origin of spindle oscillations is ongoing work but
experimental results point towards the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a
likely candidate. The TRN is rich in electrical synapses, also called gap
junctions, which promote synchrony in neural activity. Moreover, gap junctions
undergo activity-dependent long-term plasticity. We hypothesized that gap
junction plasticity can modulate spindle oscillations. We developed a
computational model of gap junction plasticity in recurrent networks of TRN and
thalamocortical neurons (TC). We showed that gap junction coupling can modulate
the TRN-TC network synchrony and that gap junction plasticity is a plausible
mechanism for the generation of sleep-spindles. Finally, our results are robust
to the simulation of pharmacological manipulation of spindles, such as the
administration of propofol, an anesthetics known to generate spindles in
humans.
