Comment on the paper Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness by Yu and
  Nikolic (2011)
This is a brief comment on the paper "Quantum mechanics needs no
consciousness" by Shan Yu and Danko Nikolic [1]. Yu and Nikolic argue that the
"consciousness causes collapse hypothesis" interpretation of quantum mechanics,
or CCCH, can be falsified by a particular experimental setup. This claim is
incorrect and the cause of the error appears to be a confusion over where and
when a collapse can be assumed to occur.
