The Substrates of Integrated Neurocognitive Rehabilitation Platforms
  (INCRPs)
The integrated neurocognitive rehabilitation platforms (INCRPs) refer to
infrastructures and teams integrated for set of interventions which aim to
restore, or compensate for cognitive deficits. Cognitive skills may be lost or
altered due to brain damage resulting from diseases or injury. The INCRP is a
two-way interactive process whereby people with neurological impairments work
with specialists, professional staff, families, and community members to
alleviate the impact of cognitive deficits. This perspective paper would
highlight key elements required in INCRPs.
