Repeated transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in nondepressed
  reduces levels of reported negative affects from daily stressors
Negative emotional responses to the daily life stresses have cumulative
effects which, in turn, impose wide-ranging negative constraints on emotional
well being and neurocognitive performance (Kalueff:2007cp, Charles:2013eq,
Nadler:2010hk). Crucial cognitive functions such as memory and problem solving,
as well more short term emotional responses (e.g., anticipation of- and
response to- monetary rewards or losses) are influenced by mood. The negative
impact of these behavioural responses is felt at the individual level, but it
also imposes major economic burden on modern healthcare systems. Although much
research have been undertaken to understand the underlying mechanisms of
depressed mood and design efficient treatment pathways, comparatively little
was done to characterize mood modulations that remain within the boundaries of
a healthy mental functioning. In one placebo-controlled experiments, we applied
daily prefrontal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) at five points
in time, and found reliable improvements on self-reported mood evaluation. We
replicated this finding in an independent double-blinded placebo-controlled
experiment and showed that stimulation over a shorter period of time (3 days)
is sufficient to create detectable mood improvements. Taken together, our data
show that repeated bilateral prefrontal tDCS can reduce psychological distress
in nondepressed individuals.
