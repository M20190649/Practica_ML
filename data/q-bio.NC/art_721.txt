Topological schemas of cognitive maps and spatial learning in the
  hippocampus
Spatial navigation in mammals is based on building a mental representation of
their environment---a cognitive map. However, both the nature of this cognitive
map and its underpinning in neural structures and activity remains vague. A key
difficulty is that these maps are collective, emergent phenomena that cannot be
reduced to a simple combination of inputs provided by individual neurons. In
this paper we suggest computational frameworks for integrating the spiking
signals of individual cells into a spatial map, which we call schemas. We
provide examples of four schemas defined by different types of topological
relations that may be neurophysiologically encoded in the brain and demonstrate
that each schema provides its own large-scale characteristics of the
environment---the schema integrals. Moreover, we find that, in all cases, these
integrals are learned at a rate which is faster than the rate of complete
training of neural networks. Thus, the proposed schema framework differentiates
between the cognitive aspect of spatial learning and the physiological aspect
at the neural network level.
