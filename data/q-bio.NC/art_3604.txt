ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge 2019: Predicting individual
  residual fluid intelligence scores from cortical grey matter morphology
We predicted residual fluid intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI data
available as part of the ABCD NP Challenge 2019, using morphological similarity
of grey-matter regions across the cortex. Individual structural covariance
networks (SCN) were abstracted into graph-theory metrics averaged over nodes
across the brain and in data-driven communities/modules. Metrics included
degree, path length, clustering coefficient, centrality, rich club coefficient,
and small-worldness. These features derived from the training set were used to
build various regression models for predicting residual fluid intelligence
scores, with performance evaluated both using cross-validation within the
training set and using the held-out validation set. Our predictions on the test
set were generated with a support vector regression model trained on the
training set. We found minimal improvement over predicting a zero residual
fluid intelligence score across the sample population, implying that structural
covariance networks calculated from T1-weighted MR imaging data provide little
information about residual fluid intelligence.
