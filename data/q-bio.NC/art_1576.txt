The case for emulating insect brains using anatomical "wiring diagrams"
  equipped with biophysical models of neuronal activity
Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense
benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and
robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility
due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However,
I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working
towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More
specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of
entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of
non-neuronal insect physiology to make "virtual insects." I argue that this is
realistically achievable within the next 25-50 years. I propose that developing
emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists,
businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal of emulating
the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating the
human brain will no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve
substantial funding and resources. This shift may facilitate a large-scale
organized push towards human WBE, making the goal potentially reachable during
the 21st century. By implementing IBE, large-scale scientific infrastructure
may shift towards developing more WBEs and move in the direction of
comprehensively understanding neural computation.
