Protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum as a non-equilibrium
  phase transition
Several neurological disorders are associated with the aggregation of
aberrant proteins, often localized in intracellular organelles such as the
endoplasmic reticulum. Here we study protein aggregation kinetics by mean-field
reactions and three dimensional Monte carlo simulations of diffusion-limited
aggregation of linear polymers in a confined space, representing the
endoplasmic reticulum. By tuning the rates of protein production and
degradation, we show that the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase
transition from a physiological phase with little or no polymer accumulation to
a pathological phase characterized by persistent polymerization. A combination
of external factors accumulating during the lifetime of a patient can thus
slightly modify the phase transition control parameters, tipping the balance
from a long symptomless lag phase to an accelerated pathological development.
The model can be successfully used to interpret experimental data on
amyloid-\b{eta} clearance from the central nervous system.
