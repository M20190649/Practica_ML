Effects of noise on models of spiny dendrites
We study the effects of noise in two models of spiny dendrites. Through the
introduction of different types of noise to both the Spike-diffuse-spike (SDS)
and Baer-Rinzel (BR) models we investigate the change in behaviour of the
travelling wave solutions present in the deterministic systems, as noise
intensity increases. We show that the speed of wave propagation in the SDS and
BR models respectively decreases and increases as the noise intensity in the
spine heads increases. Interestingly the discrepancy between the models does
not seem to arise from the type of active spine head dynamics employed by the
model but rather by the form of the spine density used. In contrast the cable
is very robust to noise and as such the speed shows very little variation from
the deterministic system. We look at the effect of the noise interpretation
used to evaluate the stochastic integral; Ito or Statonovich and discuss which
may be appropriate. We also show that the correlation time and length scales of
the noise can enhance propagation of travelling wave solutions where the white
noise dominates the signal and produces noise induced phenomena.
