Decision under ambiguity: Effects of sign and magnitude
Decision under ambiguity (uncertainty with unknown probabilities) has been
attracting attention in behavioral and neuroeconomics. However, recent
neuroimaging studies have mainly focused on gain domains while little attention
has been paid to the magnitudes of outcomes. In this study, we examined the
effects of the sign (i.e. gain and loss) and magnitude of outcomes on ambiguity
aversion and the additivity of subjective probabilities in Ellsberg's urn
problem. We observed that (i) ambiguity aversion was observed in both signs,
and (ii) subadditivity of subjective probability was not observed in negative
outcomes.
