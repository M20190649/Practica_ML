Robust and tunable bursting requires slow positive feedback
We highlight that the robustness and tunability of a bursting model
critically relies on currents that provide slow positive feedback to the
membrane potential. Such currents have the ability of making the total
conductance of the circuit negative in a time scale that is termed slow because
intermediate between the fast time scale of the spike upstroke and the
ultraslow time scale of even slower adaptation currents. We discuss how such
currents can be assessed either in voltage-clamp experiments or in
computational models. We show that, while frequent in the literature,
mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative
conductance are fragile and rigid. Our results suggest that modeling the slow
negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the
neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale.
