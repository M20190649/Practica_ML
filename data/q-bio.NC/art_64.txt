Contextual Emergence of Mental States from Neurodynamics
The emergence of mental states from neural states by partitioning the neural
phase space is analyzed in terms of symbolic dynamics. Well-defined mental
states provide contexts inducing a criterion of structural stability for the
neurodynamics that can be implemented by particular partitions. This leads to
distinguished subshifts of finite type that are either cyclic or irreducible.
Cyclic shifts correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points or limit tori
whereas irreducible shifts are obtained from generating partitions of mixing
hyperbolic systems. These stability criteria are applied to the discussion of
neural correlates of consiousness, to the definition of macroscopic neural
states, and to aspects of the symbol grounding problem. In particular, it is
shown that compatible mental descriptions, topologically equivalent to the
neurodynamical description, emerge if the partition of the neural phase space
is generating. If this is not the case, mental descriptions are incompatible or
complementary. Consequences of this result for an integration or unification of
cognitive science or psychology, respectively, will be indicated.
