How Creative Ideas Take Shape
According to the honing theory of creativity, creative thought works not on
individually considered, discrete, predefined representations but on a
contextually-elicited amalgam of items which exist in a state of potentiality
and may not be readily separable. This leads to the prediction that analogy
making proceeds not by mapping correspondences from candidate sources to
target, as predicted by the structure mapping theory of analogy, but by weeding
out non-correspondences, thereby whittling away at potentiality. Participants
were given an analogy problem, interrupted before they had time to solve it,
and asked to write down what they had by way of a solution. Na\"ive judges
categorized responses as significantly more supportive of the predictions of
honing theory than those of structure mapping.
