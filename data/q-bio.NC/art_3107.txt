A Multitaper, Causal Decomposition for Stochastic, Multivariate Time
  Series: Application to High-Frequency Calcium Imaging Data
Neural data analysis has increasingly incorporated causal information to
study circuit connectivity. Dimensional reduction forms the basis of most
analyses of large multivariate time series. Here, we present a new,
multitaper-based decomposition for stochastic, multivariate time series that
acts on the covariance of the time series at all lags, $C(\tau)$, as opposed to
standard methods that decompose the time series, $\mathbf{X}(t)$, using only
information at zero-lag. In both simulated and neural imaging examples, we
demonstrate that methods that neglect the full causal structure may be
discarding important dynamical information in a time series.
