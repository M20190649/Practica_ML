Biophysically grounded mean-field models of neural populations under
  electrical stimulation
Electrical stimulation of large neural networks is a key tool for
understanding neural population dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical
treatments. However, computational models of cortical networks of spiking
neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We present an efficient
mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons of which we analyse the dynamical properties
and validate the results using detailed network simulations. Bifurcation
diagrams reflecting the network's state reveal asynchronous up and down-states,
bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast
excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. In this
dynamical landscape, electrical stimuli can cause state transitions, such as
turning on and off oscillations. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and
phase-lock endogenous oscillations. The effects of time-varying external
stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning
the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.
