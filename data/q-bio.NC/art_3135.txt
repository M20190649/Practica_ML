Linear response for spiking neuronal networks with unbounded memory
We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal
networks, based on chains with unbounded memory. This relation allows
quantifying the influence of a weak amplitude external stimuli on
spatio-temporal spike correlations, in a general context where the memory in
spike dynamics can go arbitrarily far in the past. With this approach, we show
how linear response is explicitly related to neuron dynamics with an example,
the gIF model, introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe [91]. This illustrates
the effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network
connectivity on spike statistics.
