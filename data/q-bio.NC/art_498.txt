Quantum Models for Psychological Measurements: An Unsolved Problem
There has been a strong recent interest in applying quantum mechanics (QM)
outside physics, including in cognitive science. We analyze the applicability
of QM to two basic properties in opinion polling. The first property (response
replicability) is that, for a large class of questions, a response to a given
question is expected to be repeated if the question is posed again,
irrespective of whether another question is asked and answered in between. The
second property (question order effect) is that the response probabilities
frequently depend on the order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these
two properties occur together, it poses a problem for QM. The conventional QM
with Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the way
incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization of QM known
as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in order to account for
response replicability, the POVMs involved must be conventional operators.
Although these problems are not unique to QM and also challenge conventional
cognitive theories, they stand out as important unresolved problems for the
application of QM to cognition . Either some new principles are needed to
determine the bounds of applicability of QM to cognition, or quantum formalisms
more general than POVMs are needed.
