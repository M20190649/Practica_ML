A neuro-mathematical model for size and context related illusions
We provide here a mathematical model of size/context illusions, inspired by
the functional architecture of the visual cortex. We first recall previous
models of scale and orientation, in particular the one in (Sarti et al., 2008),
and simplify it, only considering the feature of scale. Then we recall the
deformation model of illusion, introduced by (Franceschiello et al. 2017), to
describe orientation related GOIs, and adapt it to size illusions. We finally
apply the model to the Ebbinghaus and Delboeuf illusions, validating the
results by comparing with experimental data from (Massaro et al., 1971) and
(Roberts et al., 2005).
