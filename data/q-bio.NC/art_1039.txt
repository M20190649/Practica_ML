Modeling the dynamics of human brain activity with recurrent neural
  networks
Encoding models are used for predicting brain activity in response to sensory
stimuli with the objective of elucidating how sensory information is
represented in the brain. Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear
transformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear
transformation of features to responses (response model). While there has been
extensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing
better response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent
to which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for
nonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked
response sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We
show that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly
outperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term
dependencies that drive hemodynamic responses. The results open a new window
into modeling the dynamics of brain activity in response to sensory stimuli.
