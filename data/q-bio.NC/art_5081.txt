Spike-burst chimera states in an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire
  neuronal network
Chimera states are spatiotemporal patterns in which coherence and incoherence
coexist. We observe the coexistence of synchronous (coherent) and desynchronous
(incoherent) domains in a neuronal network. The network is composed of coupled
adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons that are connected by means of
chemical synapses. In our neuronal network, the chimera states exhibit spatial
structures both with spikes and bursts activities. Furthermore, those
desynchronised domains not only have either spike or burst activity, but we
show that the structures switch between spikes and bursts as the time evolves.
Moreover, we verify the existence of multicluster chimera states.
