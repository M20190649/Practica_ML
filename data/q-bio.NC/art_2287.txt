The dynamics of H-bonds of the hydration shells of ions, ATPase and
  NE-activated adenylyl cyclase on the coupling of energy and signal
  transduction
Glycerol titration distinguished from free water the local hydration shell
involved in ATPase transition from active to inactive, with cooperativity for
water n=16. Rat brain cortex: NE-stimulated and its basal AC in the absence of
free Mg2+, allows a refractive state of AC with negative cooperativity for
MgATP and ATP4-. The erythrocyte-Hb system operates as a metabolic sensor to
match glucose availability with the release of Hb-carried, O2 and Mg2+ at CSF.
[Mg(H2O)6](H2O)122+ by chelating either a protein or ATP4- losses most of its
hydration shell. The ion pump ATPase by forming ADP3- releases an incompletely
hydrated Mg2+, which could capture H2O from either [Na.(H2O)6]+ or [K.(H2O)6]+.
Thus, sieve-sizing their hydration shells for fitting into Na+-pump channels.
An AC refractory period may participate in STM. Mg2+ with cooperativity n=3.7
activates NE-AC. CREB-generated receptors coupled by Mg2+ may modulate
hydration shells-dependent oscillations for retrieval of LTM
