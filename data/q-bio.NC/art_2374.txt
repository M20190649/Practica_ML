Synchronization in random balanced networks
Characterizing the in uence of network properties on the global emerging
behavior of interacting elements constitutes a central question in many areas,
from physical to social sciences. In this article we study a primary model of
disordered neuronal networks with excitatory-inhibitory structure and balance
constraints. We show how the interplay between structure and disorder in the
connectivity leads to a universal transition from trivial to synchronized
stationary or periodic states. This transition cannot be explained only through
the analysis of the spectral density of the connectivity matrix. We provide a
low dimensional approximation that shows the role of both the structure and
disorder in the dynamics.
