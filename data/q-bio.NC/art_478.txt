Echo-processing mechanisms in bottlenose dolphins
The mechanisms of echo-processing were investigated in our experiments,
conducted on bottlenose dolphins. Hierarchically organized system of
independent dimensions, describing echoes in animals perception, was revealed.
The rules of discrimination and recognition of echoes in dolphins were
established.
