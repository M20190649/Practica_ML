Channel Noise Effects on Neural Synchronization
Synchronization in neural networks is strongly tied to the implementation of
cognitive processes, but abnormal neuronal synchronization has been linked to a
number of brain disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Here we examine
the effects of channel noise on the synchronization of small Hodgkin-Huxley
neuronal networks. The principal feature of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is the
existence of protein channels that transition between open and closed states
with voltage dependent rate constants. The Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes
infinitely many channels, so fluctuations in the number of open channels do not
affect the voltage. However, real neurons have finitely many channels which
lead to fluctuations in the membrane voltage and modify the timing of the
spikes, which may in turn lead to large changes in the degree of
synchronization. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, neurons in the
network reach a steady state synchronization level that depends only on the
number of neurons in the network. The channel noise only affects the time it
takes to reach the steady state synchronization level.
