Modeling geometric-optical illusions: A variational approach
Visual distortions of perceived lengths, angles, or forms, are generally
known as "geometric-optical illusions" (GOI). In the present paper we focus on
a class of GOIs where the distortion of a straight line segment (the "target"
stimulus) is induced by an array of non-intersecting curvilinear elements
("context" stimulus). Assuming local target-context interactions in a vector
field representation of the context, we propose to model the perceptual
distortion of the target as the solution to a minimization problem in the
calculus of variations. We discuss properties of the solutions and reproduction
of the respective form of the perceptual distortion for several types of
contexts. Moreover, we draw a connection between the interactionist model of
GOIs and Riemannian geometry: the context stimulus is understood as perturbing
the geometry of the visual field from which the illusory distortion naturally
arises. The approach is illustrated by data from a psychophysical experiment
with nine subjects and six different contexts.
