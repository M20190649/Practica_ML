Optimal Entrainment of Neural Oscillator Ensembles
In this paper, we derive the minimum-energy periodic control that entrains an
ensemble of structurally similar neural oscillators to a desired frequency. The
state space representation of a nominal oscillator is reduced to a phase model
by computing its limit cycle and phase response curve, from which the optimal
control is derived by using formal averaging and the calculus of variations. We
focus on the case of a 1:1 entrainment ratio, and introduce a numerical method
for approximating the optimal controls. The method is applied to asymptotically
control the spiking frequency of neural oscillators modeled using the
Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This illustrates the optimality of entrainment
controls derived using phase models when applied to the original state space
system, which is a crucial requirement for using phase models in control
synthesis for practical applications. The results of this work can be used to
design low energy signals for deep brain stimulation therapies for
neuropathologies, and can be generalized for optimal frequency control of
large-scale complex oscillating systems with parameter uncertainty.
