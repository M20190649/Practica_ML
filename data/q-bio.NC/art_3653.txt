Signal Conditioning for Learning in the Wild
The mammalian olfactory system learns rapidly from very few examples,
presented in unpredictable online sequences, and then recognizes these learned
odors under conditions of substantial interference without exhibiting
catastrophic forgetting. We have developed a brain-mimetic algorithm that
replicates these properties, provided that sensory inputs adhere to a common
statistical structure. However, in natural, unregulated environments, this
constraint cannot be assured. We here present a series of signal conditioning
steps, inspired by the mammalian olfactory system, that transform diverse
sensory inputs into a regularized statistical structure to which the learning
network can be tuned. This pre-processing enables a single instantiated network
to be applied to widely diverse classification tasks and datasets - here
including gas sensor data, remote sensing from spectral characteristics, and
multi-label hierarchical identification of wild species - without adjusting
network hyperparameters.
