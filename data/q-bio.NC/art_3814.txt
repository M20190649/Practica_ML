Structured thalamocortical connectivity revealed by random walks on
  complex networks
The segregated regions of the mammalian cerebral cortex and thalamus form an
extensive and complex network, whose structure and function are still only
incompletely understood. The present article describes an application of the
concepts of complex networks and random walks that allows the identification of
non-random, highly structured features of thalamocortical connections, and
their potential effects on dynamic interactions between cortical areas in the
cat brain. Utilizing large-scale anatomical data sets of this thalamocortical
system, we investigate uniform random walks in such a network by considering
the steady state eigenvector of the respective stochastic matrix. It is shown
that thalamocortical connections are organized in such a way as to guarantee
strong correlation between the outdegree and occupancy rate (a stochastic
measure potentially related to activation) of each cortical area. Possible
organizational principles underlying this effect are identified and discussed.
