Hippocampal Spike-Timing Correlations Lead to Hexagonal Grid Fields
Space is represented in the mammalian brain by the activity of hippocampal
place cells as well as in their spike-timing correlations. Here we propose a
theory how this temporal code is transformed to spatial firing rate patterns
via spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. The resulting dynamics of
synaptic weights resembles well-known pattern formation models in which a
lateral inhibition mechanism gives rise to a Turing instability. We identify
parameter regimes in which hexagonal firing patterns develop as they have been
found in medial entorhinal cortex.
