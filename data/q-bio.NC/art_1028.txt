A Metric for Evaluating and Comparing Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation
  Algorithms
Objective: Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) may improve current
clinical DBS treatment for neurological movement disorders, but control
algorithms may perform differently across patients. New metrics are needed for
comparing and evaluating closed-loop algorithm performance that address the
specific needs of closed-loop neuromodulation controllers. Approach: A metric
is proposed for system performance that includes normalized terms that can be
used to compare algorithm performance for a patient. This metric was evaluated
using two closed-loop control algorithms that were tested in patients with
Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience rest tremor. Main Results: The metric's
resulting balance between tremor treatment and power savings varied on a per
patient and algorithm basis. This was expected given how each trial resulted in
a variable reduction in stimulation power at the cost of additional tremor for
the patient when compared to open-loop stimulation. Significance: The proposed
metric will aid in clinical evaluation of new algorithms and provide a
benchmark for future system designers. This will be important given the growing
potential applications of dynamically adjusted neural stimulation.
