Continuous Dynamic Photostimulation - inducing in-vivo-like fluctuating
  conductances with Channelrhodopsins
Central neurons operate in a regime of constantly fluctuating conductances,
induced by thousands of presynaptic cells. Channelrhodopsins have been almost
exclusively used to imprint a fixed spike pattern by sequences of brief
depolarizations. Here we introduce continuous dynamic photostimulation
(CoDyPs), a novel approach to mimic in-vivo like input fluctuations
noninvasively in cells transfected with the weakly inactivating
channelrhodopsin variant ChIEF. Even during long-term experiments, cultured
neurons subjected to CoDyPs generate seemingly random, but reproducible spike
patterns. In voltage clamped cells CoDyPs induced highly reproducible current
waveforms that could be precisely predicted from the light-conductance transfer
function of ChIEF. CoDyPs can replace the conventional, flash-evoked imprinting
of spike patterns in in-vivo and in-vitro studies, preserving natural activity.
When combined with non-invasive spike-detection, CoDyPs allows the acquisition
of order of magnitudes larger data sets than previously possible, for studies
of dynamical response properties of many individual neurons.
