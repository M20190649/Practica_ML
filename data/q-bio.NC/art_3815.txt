A Surprising Clarification of the Mechanism of Ion-channel
  Voltage-Gating
An intense controversy has surrounded the mechanism of voltage-gating in ion
channels. We interpreted the two leading models of voltage-gating with respect
to the thermodynamic energetics of membrane insertion of the voltage-sensing
'module' from a comprehensive set of potassium channels. KvAP is an archaeal
voltage-gated potassium channel whose x-ray structure was the basis for
determining the general mechanism of voltage-gating. The free energy of
membrane insertion of the KvAP voltage sensor was revealed to be a single
outlier. This was due to its unusual sequence that facilitated large gating
movements in its native lipid membrane. This degree of free energy was the
least typical of the other voltage sensors, including the Shaker potassium
channel. We inferred that the two leading models of voltage-gating referred to
alternative mechanisms of voltage-gating: each is applicable to an independent
set of ion channels. The large motion of the voltage-sensor during gating
proposed by the KvAP-paddle model of gating is unlikely to be mirrored by the
majority of ion channels whose voltage sensors are not located at the
membrane-cytoplasm interface in the channel closed state.
