Influence of paroxysmal activity on background synchronization in
  epileptic records
The presence of spikes and sharp waves in the recordings of epileptic
patients may contaminate background signal synchronization in different ways.
In this Technical Note, we present a simple procedure for assessing whether a
particular synchronization method should be used (or not) with data from
neurophysiological recordings commonly used to evaluate epilepsy. The
information provided by this procedure makes it possible to differentiate true
background synchronization from spike synchronization. This issue is
particularly relevant when differentiating between the mechanisms underlying
the onset of interictal epileptiform discharges and limbic network dynamics.
