Multi-contact synapses for stable networks: a spike-timing dependent
  model of dendritic spine plasticity and turnover
Excitatory synaptic connections in the adult neocortex consist of multiple
synaptic contacts, almost exclusively formed on dendritic spines. Changes of
dendritic spine shape and volume, a correlate of synaptic strength, can be
tracked in vivo for weeks. Here, we present a combined model of spike-timing
dependent dendritic spine plasticity and turnover that explains the steady
state multi-contact configuration of synapses in adult neocortical networks. In
this model, many presynaptic neurons compete to make strong synaptic
connections onto postsynaptic neurons, while the synaptic contacts comprising
each connection cooperate via postsynaptic firing. We demonstrate that the
model is consistent with experimentally observed long-term dendritic spine
dynamics under steady-state and lesion induced conditions, and show that
cooperation of multiple synaptic contacts is crucial for stable, long-term
synaptic memories. In simulations of a simplified network of barrel cortex, our
plasticity rule reproduces whisker-trimming induced rewiring of
thalamo-cortical and recurrent synaptic connectivity on realistic time scales.
