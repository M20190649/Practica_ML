Fractional Dynamics and Multi-Slide Model of Human Memory
We propose a single chunk model of long-term memory that combines the basic
features of the ACT-R theory and the multiple trace memory architecture. The
pivot point of the developed theory is a mathematical description of the
creation of new memory traces caused by learning a certain fragment of
information pattern and affected by the fragments of this pattern already
retained by the current moment of time. Using the available psychological and
physiological data these constructions are justified. The final equation
governing the learning and forgetting processes is constructed in the form of
the differential equation with the Caputo type fractional time derivative.
Several characteristic situations of the learning (continuous and
discontinuous) and forgetting processes are studied numerically. In particular,
it is demonstrated that, first, the "learning" and "forgetting" exponents of
the corresponding power laws of the memory fractional dynamics should be
regarded as independent system parameters. Second, as far as the spacing
effects are concerned, the longer the discontinuous learning process, the
longer the time interval within which a subject remembers the information
without its considerable lost. Besides, the latter relationship is a linear
proportionality.
