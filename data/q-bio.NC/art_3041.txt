Random versus maximum entropy models of neural population activity
The principle of maximum entropy provides a useful method for inferring
statistical mechanics models from observations in correlated systems, and is
widely used in a variety of fields where accurate data are available. While the
assumptions underlying maximum entropy are intuitive and appealing, its
adequacy for describing complex empirical data has been little studied in
comparison to alternative approaches. Here data from the collective spiking
activity of retinal neurons is reanalysed. The accuracy of the maximum entropy
distribution constrained by mean firing rates and pairwise correlations is
compared to a random ensemble of distributions constrained by the same
observables. In general, maximum entropy approximates the true distribution
better than the typical or mean distribution from that ensemble. This advantage
improves with population size, with groups as small as 8 being almost always
better described by maximum entropy. Failure of maximum entropy to outperform
random models is found to be associated with strong correlations in the
population.
