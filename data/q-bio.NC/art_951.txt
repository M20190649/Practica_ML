Mapping neuron positions to curved cortical surfaces
Real cortical tissue curves and folds according to experimental data.
However, our current simulations only use unfolded cortical layers. This
project extends the cortical slice model in order to be able to specify
arbitrary curvatures to the cortical layers and investigate the effect of
curvature and folding on neuron density and layer morphology.
