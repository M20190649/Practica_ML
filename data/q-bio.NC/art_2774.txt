Nonlinear Characteristics of Neural Signals
The study is devoted to definition of generalized metrical and topological
(informational entropy) characteristics of neural signals via their well-known
theoretical models. We have shown that time dependence of action potential of
neurons is scale invariant. Information and entropy of neural signals have
constant values in case of self-similarity and self-affinity.
