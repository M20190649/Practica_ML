Quantization of mental stress using various physiological markers
The aim of this study is to quantize mental stress by integrating different
physiological markers like reaction time, photoplethysmograph (PPG), heart rate
variability (HRV) and subjective markers like questionnaire. The study included
10 subjects of age between 22 and 26 years. Study materials included the
results of PSS questionnaire, simple reaction time, PPG data, and HRV data
during a stress inducing stroop test. The study suggests that mental stress can
be quantized when stress is induced acquisitively and more accurate
quantification of stress can be achieved by integrating many physiological
parameters.
