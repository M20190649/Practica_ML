A dry electrophysiology electrode using CNT arrays
We describe the concept of a dry electrode sensor for biopotential
measurement applications (ENOBIO) designed to eliminate the noise and
inconvenience associated to the use of electrolytic gel. ENOBIO uses
nanotechnology to remove gel-related noise, as well as maintaining a good
contact impedance to minimise interference noise. The contact surface of the
electrode will be covered with an array/forest of carbon nanotubes and will
also be tested with an Ag/AgCl coating to provide ionic-electronic
transduction. The nanotubes are to penetrate the outer layers of the skin, the
Stratum Corneum, improving electrical contact. We discuss requirements, skin
properties, nanotube penetration and transduction, noise sources, prototype
design logic and biocompatibility. A future paper will report test results.
