Chaotic Neuronal Oscillations in Spontaneous Cortical-Subcortical
  Networks
Oscillatory activities are widely observed in specific frequency bands of
recorded field potentials in different brain regions, and play critical roles
in processing neural information. Understanding the structure of these
oscillatory activities is essential for understanding the brain function. So
far many details remain elusive about their rhythmic structures and how these
oscillations are generated. We show that many oscillatory activities in
spontaneous cortical-subcortical networks, such as delta, spindle, gamma,
high-gamma and sharp wave ripple bands in different brain regions, are genuine
chaotic time series which can be reconstructed as chaotic attractors through
appropriately selected embedding delay and dimension. The reconstructed
attractors are approximated by a simple radial basis function enabling high
precision short-term prediction. Simultaneously recorded oscillatory activities
in multiple brain regions differ greatly in term of temporal phase and
amplitude but can be approximated by the same function. Our results suggest
that neural oscillations are produced by deterministic chaotic systems. The
occurrence of neural oscillation events is predetermined, and the brain
possibly knows when and where the information will be processed and transferred
in the future time as a result of the deterministic dynamic.
