Neuroscience-inspired online unsupervised learning algorithms
Although the currently popular deep learning networks achieve unprecedented
performance on some tasks, the human brain still has a monopoly on general
intelligence. Motivated by this and biological implausibility of deep learning
networks, we developed a family of biologically plausible artificial neural
networks (NNs) for unsupervised learning. Our approach is based on optimizing
principled objective functions containing a term that matches the pairwise
similarity of outputs to the similarity of inputs, hence the name -
similarity-based. Gradient-based online optimization of such similarity-based
objective functions can be implemented by NNs with biologically plausible local
learning rules. Similarity-based cost functions and associated NNs solve
unsupervised learning tasks such as linear dimensionality reduction, sparse
and/or nonnegative feature extraction, blind nonnegative source separation,
clustering and manifold learning.
