Coexistence of critical sensitivity and subcritical specificity can
  yield optimal population coding
The vicinity of phase transitions selectively amplifies weak stimuli,
yielding optimal sensitivity to distinguish external input. Along with this
enhanced sensitivity, enhanced levels of fluctuations at criticality reduce the
specificity of the response. Given that the specificity of the response is
largely compromised when the sensitivity is maximal, the overall benefit of
criticality for signal processing remains questionable. Here it is shown that
this impasse can be solved by heterogeneous systems incorporating functional
diversity, in which critical and subcritical components coexist. The subnetwork
of critical elements has optimal sensitivity, and the subnetwork of subcritical
elements has enhanced specificity. Combining segregated features extracted from
the different subgroups, the resulting collective response can maximise the
tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity measured by the
dynamic-range-to-noise-ratio. Although numerous benefits can be observed when
the entire system is critical, our results highlight that optimal performance
is obtained when only a small subset of the system is at criticality.
