Formation of three-dimensional auditory space
Human listeners need to permanently interact with their three-dimensional
(3-D) environment. To this end, they require efficient perceptual mechanisms to
form a sufficiently accurate 3-D auditory space. In this chapter, we discuss
the formation of the 3-D auditory space from various perspectives. The aim is
to show the link between cognition, acoustics, neurophysiology, and
psychophysics, when it comes to spatial hearing. First, we present recent
cognitive concepts for creating internal models of the complex auditory
environment. Second, we describe the acoustic signals available at our ears and
discuss the spatial information they convey. Third, we look into
neurophysiology, seeking for the neural substrates of the 3-D auditory space.
Finally, we elaborate on psychophysical spatial tasks and percepts that are
possible just because of the formation of the auditory space.
