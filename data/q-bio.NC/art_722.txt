Inadequate experimental methods and erroneous epilepsy diagnostic
  criteria result in confounding acquired focal epilepsy with genetic absence
  epilepsy
Here we provide a thorough discussion of the study conducted by Rodgers et
al. (J Neurosci. 2015; 35(24):9194-204. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0919-15.2015) to
investigate focal seizures and acquired epileptogenesis induced by head injury
in the rat. This manuscript serves as supplementary document for our letter to
the Editor to appear in the Journal of Neuroscience. We find that the subject
article suffers from poor experimental design, very selective consideration of
antecedent literature, and application of inappropriate epilepsy diagnostic
criteria which, together, lead to unwarranted conclusions.
