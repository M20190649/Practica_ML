Feedback Control as a Framework for Understanding Tradeoffs in Biology
Control theory arose from a need to control synthetic systems. From
regulating steam engines to tuning radios to devices capable of autonomous
movement, it provided a formal mathematical basis for understanding the role of
feedback in the stability (or change) of dynamical systems. It provides a
framework for understanding any system with feedback regulation, including
biological ones such as regulatory gene networks, cellular metabolic systems,
sensorimotor dynamics of moving animals, and even ecological or evolutionary
dynamics of organisms and populations. Here we focus on four case studies of
the sensorimotor dynamics of animals, each of which involves the application of
principles from control theory to probe stability and feedback in an organism's
response to perturbations. We use examples from aquatic (electric fish station
keeping and jamming avoidance), terrestrial (cockroach wall following) and
aerial environments (flight control in moths) to highlight how one can use
control theory to understand how feedback mechanisms interact with the physical
dynamics of animals to determine their stability and response to sensory inputs
and perturbations. Each case study is cast as a control problem with sensory
input, neural processing, and motor dynamics, the output of which feeds back to
the sensory inputs. Collectively, the interaction of these systems in a closed
loop determines the behavior of the entire system.
