Highly Scalable Neuromorphic Hardware with 1-bit Stochastic
  nano-Synapses
Thermodynamic-driven filament formation in redox-based resistive memory and
the impact of thermal fluctuations on switching probability of emerging
magnetic switches are probabilistic phenomena in nature, and thus, processes of
binary switching in these nonvolatile memories are stochastic and vary from
switching cycle-to-switching cycle, in the same device, and from
device-to-device, hence, they provide a rich in-situ spatiotemporal stochastic
characteristic. This work presents a highly scalable neuromorphic hardware
based on crossbar array of 1-bit resistive crosspoints as distributed
stochastic synapses. The network shows a robust performance in emulating
selectivity of synaptic potentials in neurons of primary visual cortex to the
orientation of a visual image. The proposed model could be configured to accept
a wide range of nanodevices.
