The effect of distributed time-delays on the synchronization of neuronal
  networks
Here we investigate the synchronization of networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo
neurons coupled in scale-free, small-world and random topologies, in the
presence of distributed time delays in the coupling of neurons. We explore how
the synchronization transition is affected when the time delays in the
interactions between pairs of interacting neurons are non-uniform. We find that
the presence of distributed time-delays does not change the behavior of the
synchronization transition significantly, vis-a-vis networks with constant
time-delay, where the value of the constant time-delay is the mean of the
distributed delays. We also notice that a normal distribution of delays gives
rise to a transition at marginally lower coupling strengths, vis-a-vis
uniformly distributed delays. These trends hold across classes of networks and
for varying standard deviations of the delay distribution, indicating the
generality of these results. So we conclude that distributed delays, which may
be typically expected in real-world situations, do not have a notable effect on
synchronization. This allows results obtained with constant delays to remain
relevant even in the case of randomly distributed delays.
