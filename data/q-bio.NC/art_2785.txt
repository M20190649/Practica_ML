Exact results for power spectrum and susceptibility of a leaky
  integrate-and-fire neuron with two-state noise
The response properties of excitable systems driven by colored noise are of
great interest, but are usually mathematically only accessible via
approximations. For this reason, dichotomous noise, a rare example of a colored
noise leading often to analytically tractable problems, has been extensively
used in the study of stochastic systems. Here, we calculate exact expressions
for the power spectrum and the susceptibility of a leaky integrate-and-fire
neuron driven by asymmetric dichotomous noise. While our results are in
excellent agreement with simulations, they also highlight a limitation of using
dichotomous noise as a simple model for more complex fluctuations: Both power
spectrum and susceptibility exhibit an undamped periodic structure, the origin
of which we discuss in detail.
