Experimental Design Modulates Variance in BOLD Activation: The Variance
  Design General Linear Model
Typical fMRI studies have focused on either the mean trend in the
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time course or functional connectivity
(FC). However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important
information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD
time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for
testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the Variance
Design General Linear Model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the
detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any
fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function
of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to i)
simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while
controlling for the other and ii) test for variance effects that could be
associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the
use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a
working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.
