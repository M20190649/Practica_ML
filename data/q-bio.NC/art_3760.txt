Odor recognition and segmentation by coupled olfactory bulb and cortical
  networks
We present a model of a coupled system of the olfactory bulb and cortex. Odor
inputs to the epithelium are transformed to oscillatory bulbar activities. The
cortex recognizes the odor by resonating to the bulbar oscillating pattern when
the amplitude and phase patterns from the bulb match an odor memory stored in
the intracortical synapses. We assume a cortical structure which transforms the
odor information in the oscillatory pattern to a slow DC feedback signal to the
bulb. This feedback suppresses the bulbar response to the pre-existing odor,
allowing subsequent odor objects to be segmented out for recognition.
