Stochastic Resonance of Ensemble Neurons for Transient Spike Trains: A
  Wavelet Analysis
By using the wavelet transformation (WT), we have analyzed the response of an
ensemble of $N$ (=1, 10, 100 and 500) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons to {\it
transient} $M$-pulse spike trains ($M=1-3$) with independent Gaussian noises.
The cross-correlation between the input and output signals is expressed in
terms of the WT expansion coefficients. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
evaluated by using the {\it denoising} method within the WT, by which the noise
contribution is extracted from output signals. Although the response of a
single (N=1) neuron to sub-threshold transient signals with noises is quite
unreliable, the transmission fidelity assessed by the cross-correlation and SNR
is shown to be much improved by increasing the value of $N$: a population of
neurons play an indispensable role in the stochastic resonance (SR) for
transient spike inputs. It is also shown that in a large-scale ensemble, the
transmission fidelity for supra-threshold transient spikes is not significantly
degraded by a weak noise which is responsible to SR for sub-threshold inputs.
