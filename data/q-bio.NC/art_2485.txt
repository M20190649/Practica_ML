Constancy and trade-offs in the neuroanatomical and metabolic design of
  the cerebral cortex
Mammalian brains span about 4 orders of magnitude in cortical volume and have
to operate in different environments that require diverse behavioral skills.
Despite these geometric and behavioral diversities, the examination of cerebral
cortex across species reveals that it contains a substantial number of
conserved characteristics that are associated with neuroanatomy and metabolism,
i.e. with neuronal connectivity and function. Some of these cortical constants
or invariants have been known for a long time but not sufficiently appreciated,
and others were only recently discovered. The focus of this review is to
present the cortical invariants and discuss their role in the efficient
information processing. Global conservation in neuroanatomy and metabolism, as
well as their correlated regional and developmental variability suggest that
these two parallel systems are mutually coupled. It is argued that energetic
constraint on cortical organization can be strong if cerebral blood supplied is
either below or above a certain level, and it is rather soft otherwise.
Moreover, because maximization or minimization of parameters associated with
cortical connectivity, function and cost often leads to conflicts in design, it
is argued that the architecture of the cerebral cortex is a result of
structural and functional compromises.
