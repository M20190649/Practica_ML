Integrated Information and Metastability in Systems of Coupled
  Oscillators
It has been shown that sets of oscillators in a modular network can exhibit a
rich variety of metastable chimera states, in which synchronisation and
desynchronisation coexist. Independently, under the guise of integrated
information theory, researchers have attempted to quantify the extent to which
a complex dynamical system presents a balance of integrated and segregated
activity. In this paper we bring these two areas of research together by
showing that the system of oscillators in question exhibits a critical peak of
integrated information that coincides with peaks in other measures such as
metastability and coalition entropy.
