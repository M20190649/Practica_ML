Analysis of Blink Rate Variability during reading and memory testing
In this paper we investigated how statistical properties of the blink rate
variability changes during two mental tasks: reading a passage and memory
testing. To construct time series of inter-blink intervals (blink rate
variability) we detected exact blink time in EEG recordings using our blink
detection algorithm. We found that among 13 subjects, all subjects blinked less
during reading session. Moreover, standard deviation of the blink rate
variability is higher during reading. Thus, we conclude that the variability of
inter-blink intervals decreases during tasks that require concentration and
intense mental activity.
