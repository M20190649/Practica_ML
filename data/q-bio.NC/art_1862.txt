Nonlinear brain dynamics and many-body field dynamics
We report measurements of the brain activity of subjects engaged in
behavioral exchanges with their environments. We observe brain states which are
characterized by coordinated oscillation of populations of neurons that are
changing rapidly with the evolution of the meaningful relationship between the
subject and its environment, established and maintained by active perception.
Sequential spatial patterns of neural activity with high information content
found in sensory cortices of trained animals between onsets of conditioned
stimuli and conditioned responses resemble cinematographic frames. They are not
readily amenable to description either with classical integrodifferential
equations or with the matrix algebras of neural networks. Their modeling is
provided by field theory from condensed matter physics.
