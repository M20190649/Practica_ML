Musical practice and cognitive aging: two cross-sectional studies point
  to phonemic fluency as a potential candidate for a use-dependent adaptation
Because of permanent use-dependent brain plasticity, all lifelong
individuals' experiences are believed to influence the cognitive aging quality.
In older individuals, both former and current musical practices have been
associated with better verbal skills, visual memory, processing speed, and
planning function. This work sought for an interaction between musical practice
and cognitive aging by comparing musician and non-musician individuals for two
lifetime periods (middle and late adulthood). Long-term memory, auditory-verbal
short-term memory, processing speed, non-verbal reasoning, and verbal fluencies
were assessed. In Study 1, measures of processing speed and auditory-verbal
short-term memory were significantly better performed by musicians compared
with controls, but both groups displayed the same age-related differences. For
verbal fluencies, musicians scored higher than controls and displayed different
age effects. In Study 2, we found that lifetime period at training onset
(childhood vs. adulthood) was associated with phonemic, but not semantic,
fluency performances (musicians who had started to practice in adulthood did
not perform better on phonemic fluency than non-musicians). Current frequency
of training did not account for musicians' scores on either of these two
measures. These patterns of results are discussed by setting the hypothesis of
a transformative effect of musical practice against a non-causal explanation.
