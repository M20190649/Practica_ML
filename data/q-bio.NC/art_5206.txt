Human Language: A Boson Gas of Quantum Entangled Cognitons
We model a piece of text of human language telling a story by means of the
quantum structure describing a Bose gas in a temperature close to a
Bose-Einstein condensate near absolute zero. For this we introduce energy
levels for the concepts (words) used in the story and we also introduce the new
notion of 'cogniton' as the quantum of human language. Concepts (words) are
then cognitons in different energy states as it is the case for photons in
different energy states, states of different frequency radiation, when the
considered boson gas would be light. We show that Bose-Einstein statistics
delivers a very good model for these pieces of texts telling stories, as well
for short stories as for long stories of the size of novels. We analyze an
unexpected connection with Zipf's law in human language, the Zipf ranking
relating to the energy levels of the words, and the Bose-Einstein graph
coinciding with the Zipf graph. We investigate the issue of 'identity and
indistinguishability' from this new perspective and conjecture that the way one
can easily understand how two 'the same concepts' are 'absolutely identical and
indistinguishable' in human language is also the way in which quantum particles
are absolutely identical and indistinguishable in physical reality, providing
new evidence for our conceptuality interpretation of quantum theory.
