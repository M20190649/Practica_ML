Bursting and Synchrony in Networks of Model Neurons
Bursting neurons are considered to be a potential cause of over-excitability
and seizure susceptibility. The functional influence of these neurons in
extended epileptic networks is still poorly understood. There is mounting
evidence that the dynamics of neuronal networks is influenced not only by
neuronal and synaptic properties but also by network topology. We investigate
numerically the influence of different neuron dynamics on global synchrony in
neuronal networks with complex connection topologies.
