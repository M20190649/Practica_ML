Transient cell assembly networks encode persistent spatial memories
While cognitive representations of an environment can last for days and even
months, the synaptic architecture of the neuronal networks that underlie these
representations constantly changes due to various forms of synaptic and
structural plasticity at a much faster timescale. This raises an immediate
question: how can a transient network maintain a stable representation of
space? In the following, we propose a computational model for describing
emergence of the hippocampal cognitive map in a network of transient place cell
assemblies and demonstrate, using methods of algebraic topology, that such a
network can maintain a robust map of the environment.
