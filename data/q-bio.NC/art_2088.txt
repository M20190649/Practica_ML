Can Centre Surround Model Explain the Enhancement of Visual Perception
  through Stochastic Resonance?
We demonstrate the ability of centre surround model for simulating the
enhancement of contrast sensitivity through stochastic resonance observed in
psychophysical experiments. We also show that this model could be used to
simulate the contrast sensitivity function through stochastic resonance. The
quality of the fit of measured contrast sensitivity function to the simulated
data is very good.
