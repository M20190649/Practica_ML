Pulsed chaos synchronization in networks with adaptive couplings
Networks of chaotic units with static couplings can synchronize to a common
chaotic trajectory. The effect of dynamic adaptive couplings on the cooperative
behavior of chaotic networks is investigated. The couplings adjust to the
activities of its two units by two competing mechanisms: An exponential
decrease of the coupling strength is compensated by an increase due to
de-synchronized activity. This mechanism prevents the network from reaching a
steady state. Numerical simulations of a coupled map lattice show chaotic
trajectories of de-synchronized units interrupted by pulses of mutually
synchronized clusters. These pulses occur on all scales, sometimes extending to
the entire network. Clusters of synchronized units can be triggered by a small
group of synchronized units.
