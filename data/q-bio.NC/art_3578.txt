Codes, Functions, and Causes: A Critique of Brette's Conceptual Analysis
  of Coding
In a recent article, Brette argues that coding as a concept is inappropriate
for explanations of neurocognitive phenomena. Here, we argue that Brette's
conceptual analysis mischaracterizes the structure of causal claims in coding
and other forms of analysis-by-decomposition. We argue that analyses of this
form are permissible, conceptually coherent, and offer essential tools for
building and developing models of neurocognitive systems like the brain.
