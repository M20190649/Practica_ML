Solving the Cable Equation Using a Compact Difference Scheme -- Passive
  Soma Dendrite
Dendrites are extensions to the neuronal cell body in the brain which are
posited in several functions ranging from electrical and chemical
compartmentalization to coincident detection. Dendrites vary across cell types
but one common feature they share is a branched structure. The cable equation
is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of voltage in
the dendrite. A solution to this equation is normally found using finite
difference schemes. Spectral methods have also been used to solve this equation
with better accuracy. Here we report the solution to the cable equation using a
compact finite difference scheme which gives spectral like resolution and can
be more easily used with modifications to the cable equation like nonlinearity,
branching and other morphological transforms. Widely used in the study of
turbulent flow and wave propagation, this is the first time it is being used to
study conduction in the brain. Here we discuss its usage in a passive, soma
dendrite construct. The superior resolving power of this scheme compared to the
central difference scheme becomes apparent with increasing complexity of the
model.
