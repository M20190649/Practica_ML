The multifractal fly: a dynamically multilayered visual system
We dynamically analyze our experimental results on the motion sensitive
spiking H1 neuron of the fly's visual system. We find that the fly uses an
alphabet composed of a few letters to encode the information contained in the
stimulus. The {\em alphabet dynamics} is multifractal both with and without
stimulus, though the multifractality increases with the stimulus entropy. This
is in sharp contrast to models generating independent spike-intervals, whose
dynamics is monofractal.
