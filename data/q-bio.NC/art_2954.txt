Dynamic Decomposition of Spatiotemporal Neural Signals
Neural signals are characterized by rich temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics
that reflect the organization of cortical networks. Theoretical research has
shown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that
correspond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data
analysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in
order to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that
capture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on
stochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through
computer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of
oscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise.
These results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis
and interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals.
