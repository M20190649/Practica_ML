Combinatorics of Place Cell Coactivity and Hippocampal Maps
It is widely accepted that the hippocampal place cells' spiking activity
produces a cognitive map of space. However, many details of this
representation's physiological mechanism remain unknown. For example, it is
believed that the place cells exhibiting frequent coactivity form functionally
interconnected groups---place cell assemblies---that drive readout neurons in
the downstream networks. However, the sheer number of coactive combinations is
extremely large, which implies that only a small fraction of them actually
gives rise to cell assemblies. The physiological processes responsible for
selecting the winning combinations are highly complex and are usually modeled
via detailed synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms. Here we propose an
alternative approach that allows modeling the cell assembly network directly,
based on a small number of phenomenological selection rules. We then
demonstrate that the selected population of place cell assemblies correctly
encodes the topology of the environment in biologically plausible time, and may
serve as a schematic model of the hippocampal network.
