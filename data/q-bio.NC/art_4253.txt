Quantum(-like) decision making: on validity of the Aumann theorem
Through set-theoretic formalization of the notion of common knowledge, Aumann
proved that if two agents have the common priors, and their posteriors for a
given event are common knowledge, then their posteriors must be equal. In this
paper we investigate the problem of validity of this theorem in the framework
of quantum(-like) decision making.
