Is psychosis caused by defective dissociation? An Artificial Life model
  for schizophrenia
Both neurobiological and environmental factors are known to play a role in
the origin of schizophrenia, but no model has been proposed that accounts for
both. This work presents a functional model of schizophrenia that merges
psychodynamic elements with ingredients borrowed from the theory of
psychological traumas, and evidences the interplay of traumatic experiences and
defective mental functions in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Our model
foresees that dissociation is a standard tool used by the mind to protect
itself from emotional pain. In case of repeated traumas, the mind learns to
adopt selective forms of dissociation to avoid pain without losing touch with
external reality. We conjecture that this process is defective in
schizophrenia, where dissociation is either too weak, giving rise to positive
symptoms, or too strong, causing negative symptoms.
