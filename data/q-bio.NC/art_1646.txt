Geometric Meditation-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in
  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Case Study
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), characterized by unwanted and
distressing intrusive thoughts, images, urges, doubts and ideas or sensations
and repetitive mental or behavioral acts, which is regarded as an overwhelming
mental disorder. Over the past few years, several studies have indicated how
mindfulness-based interventions may be effectively used to remediate OCD
symptoms based on which such methods are endorsed as effective complementary or
alternative options to remediate OCD. The present pilot investigation assessed
the effectiveness of Geometric Meditation-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy
(GM-CBT) as a novel integrated approach to help OCD symptoms. Accordingly, an
eight-week treatment program (90 minute sessions per week) in a single case of
intractable OCD was found to result in a significant reduction in OCD symptoms,
anxiety and depression as well as increased mindfulness skills and subsequent
secondary outcomes. A three-month post treatment follow up suggested
long-lasting beneficial effects. Such a pilot model may receive further
endorsement as a holistic CBT approach for OCD.
