Is a 4-bit synaptic weight resolution enough? - Constraints on enabling
  spike-timing dependent plasticity in neuromorphic hardware
Large-scale neuromorphic hardware systems typically bear the trade-off
between detail level and required chip resources. Especially when implementing
spike-timing-dependent plasticity, reduction in resources leads to limitations
as compared to floating point precision. By design, a natural modification that
saves resources would be reducing synaptic weight resolution. In this study, we
give an estimate for the impact of synaptic weight discretization on different
levels, ranging from random walks of individual weights to computer simulations
of spiking neural networks. The FACETS wafer-scale hardware system offers a
4-bit resolution of synaptic weights, which is shown to be sufficient within
the scope of our network benchmark. Our findings indicate that increasing the
resolution may not even be useful in light of further restrictions of
customized mixed-signal synapses. In addition, variations due to production
imperfections are investigated and shown to be uncritical in the context of the
presented study. Our results represent a general framework for setting up and
configuring hardware-constrained synapses. We suggest how weight discretization
could be considered for other backends dedicated to large-scale simulations.
Thus, our proposition of a good hardware verification practice may rise synergy
effects between hardware developers and neuroscientists.
