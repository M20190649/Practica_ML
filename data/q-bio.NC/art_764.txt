Observations on recent progress in the field of timing and time
  perception
Time is an important dimension of brain function, but little is still known
about the underlying cognitive principles and neurobiological mechanisms. The
field of timing and time perception has witnessed rapid growth and
multidisciplinary interest in the recent years with the advent of modern
neuroimaging, neurophysiological and optogenetic tools. In this article, I
review the literature from the last ten years (2005-2015) using a data mining
approach and highlight the most significant empirical as well as review
articles based on the number of citations (a minimum of 100 citations). Such
analysis provides a unique perspective on the current state-of-the-art in the
field and highlights subtopics in the field that have received considerable
attention, and those that have not. The objective of the article is to present
an objective summary of the current progress in the field of timing and time
perception and provide a valuable and accessible resource summarizing the most
cited articles for new as well current investigators in the field.
