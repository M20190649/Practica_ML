Stochasticity in Ca$^{2+}$ increase in spines enables robust and
  sensitive information coding
A dendritic spine is a very small structure (~0.1 {\mu}m$^3$) of a neuron
that processes input timing information. Why are spines so small? Here, we
provide functional reasons; the size of spines is optimal for information
coding. Spines code input timing information by the probability of Ca$^{2+}$
increases, which makes robust and sensitive information coding possible. We
created a stochastic simulation model of input timing-dependent Ca$^{2+}$
increases in a cerebellar Purkinje cell's spine. Spines used probability coding
of Ca$^{2+}$ increases rather than amplitude coding for input timing detection
via stochastic facilitation by utilizing the small number of molecules in a
spine volume, where information per volume appeared optimal. Probability coding
of Ca$^{2+}$ increases in a spine volume was more robust against input
fluctuation and more sensitive to input numbers than amplitude coding of
Ca$^{2+}$ increases in a cell volume. Thus, stochasticity is a strategy by
which neurons robustly and sensitively code information.
