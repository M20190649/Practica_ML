Quantum computing in neural networks
According to the statistical interpretation of quantum theory, quantum
computers form a distinguished class of probabilistic machines (PMs) by
encoding n qubits in 2n pbits (random binary variables). This raises the
possibility of a large-scale quantum computing using PMs, especially with
neural networks which have the innate capability for probabilistic information
processing. Restricting ourselves to a particular model, we construct and
numerically examine the performance of neural circuits implementing universal
quantum gates. A discussion on the physiological plausibility of proposed
coding scheme is also provided.
