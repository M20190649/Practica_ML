Analyzing Stability of Equilibrium Points in Neural Networks: A General
  Approach
Networks of coupled neural systems represent an important class of models in
computational neuroscience. In some applications it is required that
equilibrium points in these networks remain stable under parameter variations.
Here we present a general methodology to yield explicit constraints on the
coupling strengths to ensure the stability of the equilibrium point. Two models
of coupled excitatory-inhibitory oscillators are used to illustrate the
approach.
