About the Neuronal Mechanism of Lateral Hypothalamic Self-Stimulation
  Response
The experimental part of this study has shown that hunger motivation may be
evoked by a long-term (10=180 s) continuous electrical stimulation of the
"hunger center" at a current of 133.6{\pm}8.1 mkA. Positive emotions were
caused by electrostimulation at the same current intensity but short-term
duration (0.3-0.5 s). A positive feeling elicited by electrostimulation of the
motivation center can be explained in terms of the adaptation (polarization)
theory of motivation and emotion (Murik, 2001, 2005).
