Estimating the dimensionality of neural responses with fMRI Repetition
  Suppression
We propose a novel method that exploits fMRI Repetition Suppression (RS-fMRI)
to measure the dimensionality of the set response vectors, i.e. the dimension
of the space of linear combinations of neural population activity patterns in
response to specific task conditions. RS-fMRI measures the overlap between
response vectors even in brain areas displaying no discernible average
differential BOLD signal. We show how this property can be used to estimate the
neural response dimensionality in areas lacking macroscopic spatial patterning.
The importance of dimensionality derives from how it relates to a neural
circuit's functionality. As we show, the dimensionality of the response vectors
is predicted to be high in areas involved in multi-stream integration, while it
is low in areas where inputs from independent sources do not interact or merely
overlap linearly. Our method can be used to identify and functionally
characterize cortical circuits that integrate multiple independent information
pathways.
