Existence of Traveling Waves in a Neural Model
In 1992 G. B. Ermentrout and J. B. McLeod published a landmark study of
traveling wave fronts for a differential-integral equation modeling a neural
network. Since then a number of authors have extended the model by adding an
additional equation for a "recovery variable", thus allowing the possibility of
traveling pulse type solutions. In a recent paper G. Faye gave perhaps the
first rigorous proof of the existence (and stability) of a traveling pulse
solution for such a model. The excitatory weight function J used in this work
allowed the system to be reduced to a set of four coupled ODEs, and a specific
firing rate function S, with parameters, was considered. The method of
geometric singular perturbation was employed, together with blow-ups. In this
paper, while keeping the same J, we extend Faye's work by obtaining both the
fast and slow waves and by removing Faye's hypothesis that the wave passes
"under the knee". We also consider a more general set of functions S, and we
use only standard ode methods.
