Derivation of human chromatic discrimination ability from an
  information-theoretical notion of distance in color space
The accuracy with which humans can detect small chromatic differences varies
throughout color space. For example, we are far more precise when
discriminating two similar orange stimuli than two similar green stimuli. In
order for two colors to be perceived as different, the neurons representing
chromatic information must respond differently, and the difference must be
larger than the trial-to-trial variability of the response to each separate
color. Photoreceptors constitute the first stage in the processing of color
information; many more stages are required before humans can consciously report
whether two stimuli are perceived as chromatically distinguishable or not.
Therefore, although photoreceptor absorption curves are expected to influence
the accuracy of conscious discriminability, there is no reason to believe that
they should suffice to explain it. Here we develop information-theoretical
tools based on the Fisher metric that demonstrate that photoreceptor absorption
properties explain ~87% of the variance of human color discrimination ability,
as tested by previous behavioral experiments. In the context of this theory,
the bottleneck in chromatic information processing is determined by
photoreceptor absorption characteristics. Subsequent encoding stages modify
only marginally the chromatic discriminability at the photoreceptor level.
