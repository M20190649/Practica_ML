Mind Control as a Guide for the Mind
The human brain is a complex network that supports mental function. The
nascent field of network neuroscience applies tools from mathematics to
neuroimaging data in the hopes of shedding light on cognitive function. A
critical question arising from these empirical studies is how to modulate a
human brain network to treat cognitive deficits or enhance mental abilities.
While historically a number of tools have been employed to modulate mental
states (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and brain stimulation),
theoretical frameworks to guide these interventions - and to optimize them for
clinical use - are fundamentally lacking. One promising and as-yet
underexplored approach lies in a sub-discipline of engineering known as network
control theory. Here, we posit that network control fundamentally relates to
mind control, and that this relationship highlights important areas for future
empirical research and opportunities to translate knowledge in practical
domains. We clarify the conceptual intersection between neuroanatomy,
cognition, and control engineering in the context of network neuroscience.
Finally, we discuss the challenges, ethics, and promises of mind control.
