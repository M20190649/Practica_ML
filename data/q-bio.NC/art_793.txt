Mathematical transcription of the "Time-Based Resource Sharing" theory
  of working memory
The time-based resource sharing (TBRS) model is a prominent model of working
memory that is both predictive and simple. The TBRS is the mainstream
decay-based model and the most susceptible to competition with
interference-based models. A connectionist implementation of the TBRS, the
TBRS*, has recently been developed. However, the TBRS* is an enriched version
of the TBRS, making it difficult to test the general characteristics resulting
from the TBRS assumptions. Here, we describe a novel model, the TBRS2, built to
be more transparent and simple than the TBRS*. The TBRS2 is minimalist and
allows only a few parameters. It is a straightforward mathematical
transcription of the TBRS that focuses exclusively on the activation level of
memory items as a function of time. Its simplicity makes it possible to derive
several theorems from the original TBRS and allows several variants of the
refreshing process to be tested without relying on particular architectures.
