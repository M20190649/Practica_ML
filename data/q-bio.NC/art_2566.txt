Modulated escape from a metastable state driven by colored noise
Many phenomena in nature are described by excitable systems driven by colored
noise. The temporal correlations in the fluctuations hinder an analytical
treatment. We here present a general method of reduction to a white-noise
system, capturing the color of the noise by effective and time-dependent
boundary conditions. We apply the formalism to a model of the excitability of
neuronal membranes, the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model, revealing an
analytical expression for the linear response of the system valid up to
moderate frequencies. The closed form analytical expression enables the
characterization of the response properties of such excitable units and the
assessment of oscillations emerging in networks thereof.
