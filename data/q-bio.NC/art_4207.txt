Synaptic metaplasticity underlies tetanic potentiation in Lymnaea: a
  novel paradigm
We present a mathematical model which explains and interprets a novel form of
short-term potentiation, which was found to be use-, but not time-dependent, in
experiments done on Lymnaea neurons. The high degree of potentiation is
explained using a model of synaptic metaplasticity, while the use-dependence
(which is critically reliant on the presence of kinase in the experiment) is
explained using a model of a stochastic and bistable biological switch.
