Clique Topology Reveals Intrinsic Geometric Structure in Neural
  Correlations: An Overview
This publication serves as an overview of clique topology -- a novel matrix
analysis technique used to extract structural features from neural activity
data that contains hidden nonlinearities. We highlight work done by Gusti et
al. which introduces clique topology and verifies its applicability to neural
feature extraction by showing that neural correlations in the rat hippocampus
are determined by geometric structure of hippocampal circuits, rather than
being a consequence of positional coding.
