Evolutionary Understanding of the Conditions Leading to Estimation of
  Behavioral Properties through System Dynamics
One of the basic frameworks in science views behavioral products as a process
within a dynamic system. The mechanism might be seen as a representation of
many instances of centralized control in real time. Many real systems, however,
exhibit autonomy by denying statically treated mechanisms. This study addresses
the issues related to the identification of dynamic systems and suggests how
determining the basic principles of a collective structure may be key to
understanding complex behavioral processes. A fundamental model is derived to
assess the advantages of this perspective using a basic methodology. The
connection between perspective and technique demonstrates certain aspects
within their actual context, while also clearly including the framework of
actual dynamic system identification.
