Hebbian Plasticity for Improving Perceptual Decisions
Shibata et al. reported that humans could learn to repeatedly evoke a
stimulus-associated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity
pattern in visual areas V1/V2 through which visual perceptual learning was
achieved without stimulus presentation. Contrary to their attribution of visual
improvements to neuroplasticity in adult V1/V2, our Hebbian learning
interpretation of these data explains the attainment of better perceptual
decisions without plastic V1/V2.
