The brain near the edge
When viewed at a certain coarse grain, the brain seems a relatively small
dynamical system composed by a few dozen interacting areas, performing a number
of stereotypical behaviors. It is known that, even relatively small dynamical
systems can reliably generate robust and flexible behavior if they are possed
near a second order phase transition, because of the abundance of metastable
states at the critical point. The approach pursued here assumes that some of
the most fundamental properties of the functioning brain are possible because
it is spontaneously possed at the border of such instability. In this notes we
review the motivation, the arguments and recent results as well as the
implications of this view of the functioning brain.
