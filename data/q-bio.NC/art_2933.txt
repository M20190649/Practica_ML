The leaky integrator with recurrent inhibition as a predictor
It is shown that the leaky integrator, the basis for many neuronal models,
possesses a negative group delay when a time-delayed recurrent inhibition is
added to it. By means of this negative group delay, the leaky integrator
becomes a predictor for some frequency components of the input signal. The
prediction properties are derived analytically and an application to a local
field potential is provided.
