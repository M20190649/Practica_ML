Prediction of Synchrostate Transitions in EEG Signals Using Markov Chain
  Models
This paper proposes a stochastic model using the concept of Markov chains for
the inter-state transitions of the millisecond order quasi-stable phase
synchronized patterns or synchrostates, found in multi-channel
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. First and second order transition
probability matrices are estimated for Markov chain modelling from 100 trials
of 128-channel EEG signals during two different face perception tasks.
Prediction accuracies with such finite Markov chain models for synchrostate
transition are also compared, under a data-partitioning based cross-validation
scheme.
