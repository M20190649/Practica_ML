Diffusion Entropy Approach to Dynamical Characteristics of a
  Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron
By means of the concept DE we analyze the responses of a HH neuron to two
types of spike-train inputs. Two characteristic quantities can be extracted,
which can reflect partially the dynamical process of a HH neuron.
