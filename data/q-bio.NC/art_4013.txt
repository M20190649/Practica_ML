Charge-Balanced Minimum-Power Controls for Spiking Neuron Oscillators
In this paper, we study the optimal control of phase models for spiking
neuron oscillators. We focus on the design of minimum-power current stimuli
that elicit spikes in neurons at desired times. We furthermore take the
charge-balanced constraint into account because in practice undesirable side
effects may occur due to the accumulation of electric charge resulting from
external stimuli. Charge-balanced minimum-power controls are derived for a
general phase model using the maximum principle, where the cases with unbounded
and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of practical
importance since phase models are more accurate for weak forcing. The developed
optimal control strategies are then applied to both mathematically ideal and
experimentally observed phase models to demonstrate their applicability,
including the phase model for the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley equations.
