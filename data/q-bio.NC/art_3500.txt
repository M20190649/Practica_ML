Pattern phase diagram of spiking neurons on spatial networks
We study an abstracted model of neuronal activity via numerical simulation,
and report spatiotemporal pattern formation and critical like dynamics. A
population of pulse coupled, discretised, relaxation oscillators is simulated
over networks with varying edge density and spatial embedded ness. For
intermediate edge density and sufficiently strong spatial embeddedness, we
observe a novel spatiotemporal pattern in the field of oscillator phases,
visually resembling the surface of a frothing liquid. Increasing the edge
density results in critical dynamics, with the distribution of neuronal
avalanche sizes following a power law with exponent one. Further increase of
the edge density results in metastable behaviour between pattern formation and
synchronisation, before transitioning the system entirely into synchrony.
