Natural statistics of binaural sounds
Binaural sound localization is usually considered a discrimination task,
where interaural time (ITD) and level (ILD) disparities at pure frequency
channels are utilized to identify a position of a sound source. In natural
conditions binaural circuits are exposed to a stimulation by sound waves
originating from multiple, often moving and overlapping sources. Therefore
statistics of binaural cues depend on acoustic properties and the spatial
configuration of the environment. In order to process binaural sounds
efficiently, the auditory system should be adapted to naturally encountered cue
distributions. Statistics of cues encountered naturally and their dependence on
the physical properties of an auditory scene have not been studied before.
Here, we performed binaural recordings of three auditory scenes with varying
spatial properties. We have analyzed empirical cue distributions from each
scene by fitting them with parametric probability density functions which
allowed for an easy comparison of different scenes. Higher order statistics of
binaural waveforms were analyzed by performing Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) and studying properties of learned basis functions. Obtained results can
be related to known neuronal mechanisms and suggest how binaural hearing can be
understood in terms of adaptation to the natural signal statistics.
