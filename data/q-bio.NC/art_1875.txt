A hypothesis on the selective advantage for sleep
In this note, we present a hypothesis for the emergence of the phenomenon of
sleep in organisms with sufficiently developed central nervous systems. We
argue that sleep emerges because individual neurons must periodically enter a
resting state and perform various ``garbage collection'' activities. Because
the proper functioning of the central nervous system is dependent on the
interconnections amongst a large collection of individual neurons, it becomes
optimal, from the standpoint of the organism, for these garbage collection
activities to occur simultaneously. We present analogies with complex
structures in modern economies to make our case, although we emphasize that our
hypothesis is purely speculative at this time. Although the ``garbage
collection'' hypothesis has been previously advanced, we believe that our
speculation is useful because it illustrates the power of a general paradigm
for understanding the emergence of collective behavior in agent-built systems.
