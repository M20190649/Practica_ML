Controlling Statistical Moments of Stochastic Dynamical Networks
We consider a general class of stochastic networks and ask which network
nodes need to be controlled, and how, to stabilize and switch between desired
metastable (target) states in terms of the first and second statistical moments
of the system. We first show that it is sufficient to directly interfere with a
subset of nodes which can be identified using information about the graph of
the network only. Then, we develop a suitable method for feedback control which
acts on that subset of nodes and preserves the covariance structure of the
desired target state. Finally, we demonstrate our theoretical results using a
stochastic Hopfield network and a global brain model. Our results are
applicable to a variety of (model) networks, and further our understanding of
the relationship between network structure and collective dynamics for the
benefit of effective control.
