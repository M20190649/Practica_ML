A neural marker of obsessive-compulsive disorder from whole-brain
  functional connectivity
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder with a
lifetime prevalence of 2-3 percent. Recently, brain activity in the resting
state is gathering attention as a new means of exploring altered functional
connectivity in psychiatric disorders. Although previous resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigated neurobiological
abnormalities of patients with OCD, there are concerns that should be
addressed. One concern is the validity of the hypothesis employed. Most studies
used seed-based analysis of the fronto-striatal circuit, despite the potential
for abnormalities in other regions. A hypothesis-free study is a promising
approach in such a case, while it requires researchers to handle a dataset with
large dimensions. Another concern is the reliability of biomarkers derived from
a single dataset, which may be influenced by cohort-specific features. Here, by
employing a recently developed machine-learning algorithm to avoid these
concerns, we identified the first OCD biomarker that is generalized to an
external dataset. We also demonstrated that the functional connectivities that
contributed to the classification were widely distributed rather than locally
constrained. Our generalizable classifier has the potential not only to deepen
our understanding of the abnormal neural substrates of OCD but also to find use
in clinical applications.
