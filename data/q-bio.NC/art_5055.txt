Quantifying High-order Interdependencies via Multivariate Extensions of
  the Mutual Information
This article introduces a model-agnostic approach to study statistical
synergy, a form of emergence in which patterns at large scales are not
traceable from lower scales. Our framework leverages various multivariate
extensions of Shannon's mutual information, and introduces the O-information as
a metric capable of characterising synergy- and redundancy-dominated systems.
We develop key analytical properties of the O-information, and study how it
relates to other metrics of high-order interactions from the statistical
mechanics and neuroscience literature. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use
the proposed framework to explore the relevance of statistical synergy in
Baroque music scores.
