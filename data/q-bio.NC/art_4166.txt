LÃ©vy flights in human behavior and cognition
L\'evy flights represent the best strategy to randomly search for a target in
an unknown environment, and have been widely observed in many animal species.
Here, we inspect and discuss recent results concerning human behavior and
cognition. Different studies have shown that human mobility can be described in
terms of L\'evy flights, while fresh evidence indicates that the same pattern
accounts for human mental searches in online gambling sites. Thus, L\'evy
flights emerge as a unifying concept with broad cross-disciplinary
implications. We argue that the ubiquity of such a pattern, both in behavior
and cognition, suggests that the brain regions responsible for this behavior
are likely to be evolutionarily old (i.e. no frontal cortex is involved), and
that fMRI techniques might help to confirm this hypothesis.
