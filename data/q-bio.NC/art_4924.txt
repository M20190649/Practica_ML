Cognitive chimera states in human brain networks
The human brain is a complex dynamical system that gives rise to cognition
through spatiotemporal patterns of coherent and incoherent activity between
brain regions. As different regions dynamically interact to perform cognitive
tasks, variable patterns of partial synchrony can be observed, forming chimera
states. We propose that the emergence of such states plays a fundamental role
in the cognitive organization of the brain, and present a novel
cognitively-informed, chimera-based framework to explore how large-scale brain
architecture affects brain dynamics and function. Using personalized brain
network models, we systematically study how regional brain stimulation produces
different patterns of synchronization across predefined cognitive systems. We
then analyze these emergent patterns within our novel framework to understand
the impact of subject-specific and region-specific structural variability on
brain dynamics. Our results suggest a classification of cognitive systems into
four groups with differing levels of subject and regional variability that
reflect their different functional roles.
