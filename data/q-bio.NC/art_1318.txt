Maps of Visual Importance
The importance of an element in a visual stimulus is commonly associated with
the fixations during a free-viewing task. We argue that fixations are not
always correlated with attention or awareness of visual objects. We suggest to
filter the fixations recorded during exploration of the image based on the
fixations recorded during recalling the image against a neutral background.
This idea exploits that eye movements are a spatial index into the memory of a
visual stimulus. We perform an experiment in which we record the eye movements
of 30 observers during the presentation and recollection of 100 images. The
locations of fixations during recall are only qualitatively related to the
fixations during exploration. We develop a deformation mapping technique to
align the fixations from recall with the fixation during exploration. This
allows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity
provides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the
spatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of
removed fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be
considered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of
importance of visual elements for human observers.
