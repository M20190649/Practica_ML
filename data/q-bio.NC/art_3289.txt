Finding informative neurons in the brain using Multi-Scale Relevance
We propose a metric - called Multi-Scale Relevance (MSR) - to score neurons
for their prominence in encoding for the animal's behaviour that is being
observed in a multi-electrode array recording experiment. The MSR assumes that
relevant neurons exhibit a wide variability in their dynamical state, in
response to the external stimulus, across different time scales. It is a
non-parametric, fully featureless indicator, in that it uses only the time
stamps of the firing activity, without resorting to any a priori covariate or
invoking any specific tuning curve for neural activity. We test the method on
data from freely moving rodents, where we found that neurons having low MSR
tend to have low mutual information and low firing sparsity across the
correlates that are believed to be encoded by the region of the brain where the
recordings were made. In addition, neurons with high MSR contain significant
information on spatial navigation and allow to decode spatial position or head
direction as efficiently as those neurons whose firing activity has high mutual
information with the covariate to be decoded.
