Control of the repetitive firing in the squid giant axon using
  electrical fields
In this research, the aim is to develop a repetitive firing stopper mechanism
using electrical fields exerted on the fiber. The Hodgkin - Huxley nerve fiber
model is used for modeling the membrane potential behavior. The repetitive
firing of the nerve fiber can be stopped using approaches based on the control
theory where the nonlinear Hodgkin - Huxley model is used to achieve this goal.
The effects of the electrical field are considered as an additive quantity over
the equilibrium potentials of the cell membrane channels. The study is a
representative of an experimental application.
