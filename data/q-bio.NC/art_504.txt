Contextual emergence of intentionality
By means of an intriguing physical example, magnetic surface swimmers, that
can be described in terms of Dennett's intentional stance, I reconstruct a
hierarchy of necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of the
intentional strategy. It turns out that the different levels of the intentional
hierarchy are contextually emergent from their respective subjacent levels by
imposing stability constraints upon them. At the lowest level of the hierarchy,
phenomenal physical laws emerge for the coarse-grained description of open,
nonlinear, and dissipative nonequilibrium systems in critical states. One level
higher, dynamic patterns, such as, e.g., magnetic surface swimmers, are
contextually emergent as they are invariant under certain symmetry operations.
Again one level up, these patterns behave apparently rational by selecting
optimal pathways for the dissipation of energy that is delivered by external
gradients. This is in accordance with the restated Second Law of thermodynamics
as a stability criterion. At the highest level, true believers are intentional
systems that are stable under exchanging their observation conditions.
