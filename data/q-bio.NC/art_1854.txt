Complete structure of topographic maps in ephrin-A deficient mice
Axons of retinal ganglion cells establish orderly projections to the superior
colliculus of the midbrain. Axons of neighboring cells terminate proximally in
the superior colliculus thus forming a topographically precise representation
of the visual world. Coordinate axes are encoded in retina and in the target
through graded expression of chemical labels. Mapping based on chemical labels
alone does not yield required specificity of connections. Additional sharpening
is provided by electrical activity, which is correlated between neighboring
axons. Here we propose a quantitative model which allows combining the effects
of chemical labels and correlated activity in a single approach. Using this
model we study a complete structure of two-dimensional topographic maps in
mutant mice, in which one of the labels, encoding horizontal retinal coordinate
(ephrin-A), is reduced/eliminated. We show that topographic maps in ephrin-A
deficient mice display granular structure, with the regions of smooth mapping
separated by linear discontinuities reminiscent of fractures observed in the
maps of preferred orientation. We also demonstrate the presence of point
singularities in topographic maps.
