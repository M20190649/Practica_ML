Exploring Neuronal Bistability at the Depolarization Block
Many neurons display bistability - coexistence of two firing modes such as
bursting and tonic spiking or tonic spiking and silence. Bistability has been
proposed to endow neurons with richer forms of information processing in
general and to be involved in short-term memory in particular by allowing a
brief signal to elicit long-lasting changes in firing. In this paper, we focus
on bistability that allows for a choice between tonic spiking and
depolarization block in a wide range of the depolarization levels. We consider
the spike-producing currents in two neurons, models of which differ by the
parameter values. Our dopaminergic neuron model displays bistability in a wide
range of applied currents at the depolarization block. The Hodgkin-Huxley model
of the squid giant axon shows no bistability. We varied parameter values for
the model to analyze transitions between the two parameter sets. We show that
bistability primarily characterizes the inactivation of the Na+ current. Our
study suggests a connection between the amount of the Na+ window current and
the length of the bistability range. For the dopaminergic neuron we hypothesize
that bistability can be linked to a prolonged action of antipsychotic drugs.
