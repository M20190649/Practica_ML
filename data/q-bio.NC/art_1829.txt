Two hypotheses about natural intelligence
We assume that the natural intelligence (human, particularly) is equivalent
to a large inferring structure, which took shape in the last 400/500 million
years. Then two hypotheses, about this structure and its development, are put
forward for consideration. The first one concerns the transmission, from one
generation to another, of the structure: we propose that this passage is done
by direct transfer, mother to children, during pregnancy (maternal download).
The second hypothesis regards the structure evolution: now the acquired
improvements can be transferred to the descendants, so it is possible to
envisage a governed evolutionary process (evolution by improvements).
