Triangular lattice neurons may implement an advanced numeral system to
  precisely encode rat position over large ranges
We argue by observation of the neural data that neurons in area dMEC of rats,
which fire whenever the rat is on any vertex of a regular triangular lattice
that tiles 2-d space, may be using an advanced numeral system to reversibly
encode rat position. We interpret measured dMEC properties within the framework
of a residue number system (RNS), and describe how RNS encoding -- which breaks
the non-periodic variable of rat position into a set of narrowly distributed
periodic variables -- allows a small set of cells to compactly represent and
efficiently update rat position with high resolution over a large range. We
show that the uniquely useful properties of RNS encoding still hold when the
encoded and encoding quantities are relaxed to be real numbers with built-in
uncertainties, and provide a numerical and functional estimate of the range and
resolution of rat positions that can be uniquely encoded in dMEC. The use of a
compact, `arithmetic-friendly' numeral system to encode a metric variable, as
we propose is happening in dMEC, is qualitatively different from all previously
identified examples of coding in the brain. We discuss the numerous
neurobiological implications and predictions of our hypothesis.
