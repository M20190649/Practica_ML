A topological approach to neural complexity
Considerable efforts in modern statistical physics is devoted to the study of
networked systems. One of the most important example of them is the brain,
which creates and continuously develops complex networks of correlated
dynamics. An important quantity which captures fundamental aspects of brain
network organization is the neural complexity C(X)introduced by Tononi et al.
This work addresses the dependence of this measure on the topological features
of a network in the case of gaussian stationary process. Both anlytical and
numerical results show that the degree of complexity has a clear and simple
meaning from a topological point of view. Moreover the analytical result offers
a straightforward algorithm to compute the complexity than the standard one.
