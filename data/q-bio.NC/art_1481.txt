If the charged particle transport phenomenon in electrical circuits or
  in biological neurons is described using Riemann-Liouville or Caputo
  fractional order derivatives, then objectivity is lost
In this paper the objectivity of the description of charged particles
transport in electrical circuits, in biological neurons and biological
neuron-networks is discussed. It is shown that the use of Riemann-Liouville or
Caputo fractional order derivatives leads to the loose of the description
objectivity.
