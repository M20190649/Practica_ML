Predicting upcoming actions by observation: some facts, models and
  challenges
Predicting another person's upcoming action to build an appropriate response
is a regular occurrence in the domain of motor control. In this review we
discuss conceptual and experimental approaches aiming at the neural basis of
predicting and learning to predict upcoming movements by their observation.
