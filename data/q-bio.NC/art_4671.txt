Associative pattern recognition through macro-molecular self-assembly
We show that macro-molecular self-assembly can recognize and classify
high-dimensional patterns in the concentrations of $N$ distinct molecular
species. Similar to associative neural networks, the recognition here leverages
dynamical attractors to recognize and reconstruct partially corrupted patterns.
Traditional parameters of pattern recognition theory, such as sparsity,
fidelity, and capacity are related to physical parameters, such as nucleation
barriers, interaction range, and non-equilibrium assembly forces. Notably, we
find that self-assembly bears greater similarity to continuous attractor neural
networks, such as place cell networks that store spatial memories, rather than
discrete memory networks. This relationship suggests that features and
trade-offs seen here are not tied to details of self-assembly or neural network
models but are instead intrinsic to associative pattern recognition carried out
through short-ranged interactions.
