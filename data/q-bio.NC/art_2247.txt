Diffusion Based Modeling of Human Brain Response to External Stimuli
Human brain response is the overall ability of the brain in analyzing
internal and external stimuli in the form of transferred energy to the
mind/brain phase-space and thus, making the proper decisions. During the last
decade scientists discovered about this phenomenon and proposed some models
based on computational, biological, or neuropsychological methods. Despite some
advances in studies related to this area of the brain research there was less
effort which have been done on the mathematical modeling of the human brain
response to external stimuli. This research is devoted to the modeling of human
EEG signal, as an alert state of overall human brain activity monitoring, due
to receiving external stimuli, based on fractional diffusion equation. The
results of this modeling show very good agreement with the real human EEG
signal and thus, this model can be used as a strong representative of the human
brain activity.
