Constructing an olfactory perceptual space and predicting percepts from
  molecular structure
Given the structure of a novel molecule, there is still no one who can
reliably predict what odor percept that molecule will evoke. The challenge
comes from both the difficulty in quantitatively characterizing molecular
structure, and the inadequacy of language to fully characterize olfactory
perception. Here, we present a novel approach to both problems.
