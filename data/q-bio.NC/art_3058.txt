Sign-changes as a universal concept in first-passage time calculations
First-passage time problems are ubiquitous across many fields of study
including transport processes in semiconductors and biological synapses,
evolutionary game theory and percolation. Despite their prominence,
first-passage time calculations have proven to be particularly challenging.
Analytical results to date have often been obtained under strong conditions,
leaving most of the exploration of first-passage time problems to direct
numerical computations. Here we present an analytical approach that allows the
derivation of first-passage time distributions for the wide class of
non-differentiable Gaussian processes. We demonstrate that the concept of sign
changes naturally generalises the common practice of counting crossings to
determine first-passage events. Our method works across a wide range of
time-dependent boundaries and noise strengths thus alleviating common hurdles
in first-passage time calculations.
