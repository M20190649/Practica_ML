Relationships Between Characteristic Path Length, Efficiency, Clustering
  Coefficients, and Graph Density
The graph theoretic properties of the clustering coefficient, characteristic
(or average) path length, global and local efficiency, provide valuable
information regarding the structure of a graph. These four properties have
applications to biological and social networks and have dominated much of the
the literature in these fields. While much work has done in applied settings,
there has yet to be a mathematical comparison of these metrics from a
theoretical standpoint. Motivated by networks appearing in neuroscience, we
show in this paper that these properties can be linked together using a single
property - graph density.
