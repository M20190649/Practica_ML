Power spectrum and diffusion of the Amari neural field
We study the power spectrum of a space-time dependent neural field which
describes the average membrane potential of neurons in a single layer. This
neural field is modelled by a dissipative integro-differential equation, the
so-called Amari equation. By considering a small perturbation with respect to a
stationary and uniform configuration of the neural field we derive a linearized
equation which is solved for a generic external stimulus by using the Fourier
transform into wavevector-freqency domain, finding an analytical formula for
the power spectrum of the neural field. In addition, after proving that for
large wavelengths the linearized Amari equation is equivalent to a diffusion
equation which admits space-time dependent analytical solutions, we take into
account the nonlinearity of the Amari equation. We find that for large
wavelengths a weak nonlinearity in the Amari equation gives rise to a
reaction-diffusion equation which can be formally derived from a neural action
functional by introducing a dual neural field. For some initial conditions, we
discuss analytical solutions of this reaction-diffusion equation.
