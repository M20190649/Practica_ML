Complex patterns arise through spontaneous symmetry breaking in dense
  homogeneous networks of neural oscillators
Recent experiments have highlighted how collective dynamics in networks of
brain regions affect behavior and cognitive function. In this paper we show
that a simple, homogeneous system of densely connected oscillators representing
the aggregate activity of local brain regions can exhibit a rich variety of
dynamical patterns emerging via spontaneous breaking of permutation or
translational symmetry. Our results connect recent experimental findings and
suggest that a range of complicated activity patterns seen in the brain could
be explained even without a full knowledge of its wiring diagram.
