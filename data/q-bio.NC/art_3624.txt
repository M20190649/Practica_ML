Secrets of the Brain: An Introduction to the Brain Anatomical Structure
  and Biological Function
In this paper, we will provide an introduction to the brain structure and
function. Brain is an astonishing living organ inside our heads, weighing about
1.5kg, consisting of billions of tiny cells. The brain enables us to sense the
world around us (to touch, to smell, to see and to hear, etc.), to think and to
respond to the world as well. The main obstacles that prevent us from creating
a machine which can behavior like real-world creatures are due to our limited
knowledge about the brain in both its structure and its function. In this
paper, we will focus introducing the brain anatomical structure and biological
function, as well as its surrounding sensory systems. Many of the materials
used in this paper are from wikipedia and several other neuroscience
introductory articles, which will be properly cited in this article. This is
the first of the three tutorial articles about the brain (the other two are
[26] and [27]). In the follow-up two articles, we will further introduce the
low-level composition basis structures (e.g., neuron, synapse and action
potential) and the high-level cognitive functions (e.g., consciousness,
attention, learning and memory) of the brain, respectively.
