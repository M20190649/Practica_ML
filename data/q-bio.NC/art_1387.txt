Conscious Perception: Time for an Update?
Understanding the neural mechanism underlying subjective representation has
become a central endeavor in cognitive-neuroscience. In theories of conscious
perception, stimulus gaining conscious access is usually considered as a
discrete neuronal event to be characterized in time or space, sometimes refer
to as a 'conscious episode'. Surprisingly, the alternative hypothesis according
to which conscious perception is a dynamic process has been rarely considered.
Here, we discuss this hypothesis and envisage its implications. We show how it
can reconcile inconsistent empirical findings on the timing of the neural
correlates of consciousness (NCCs), and make testable predictions. According to
this hypothesis, a stimulus is consciously perceived for as long as it is
recoded to fit an ongoing stream composed of all other perceived stimuli. We
suggest that this 'updating' process is governed by at least three factors (1)
context, (2) stimulus saliency and (3) observer's goal. Finally, this framework
forces us to reconsider the typical distinction between conscious and
unconscious information processing.
