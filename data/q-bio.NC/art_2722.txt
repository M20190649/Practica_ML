Some Examples of Contextuality in Physics: Implications to Quantum
  Cognition
Contextuality, the impossibility of assigning a single random variable to
represent the outcomes of the same measurement procedure under different
experimental conditions, is a central aspect of quantum mechanics. Thus
defined, it appears in well-known cases in quantum mechanics, such as the
double-slit experiment, the Bell-EPR experiment, and the Kochen-Specker
theorem. Here we examine contextuality in such cases, and discuss how each of
them bring different conceptual issues when applied to quantum cognition. We
then focus on the shortcomings of using quantum probabilities to describe
social systems, and explain how negative quasi-probability distributions may
address such limitations.
