A free energy principle for a particular physics
This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished
from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical
independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition
of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This
decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics -
via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical
mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via
classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian
mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a
formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the
implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium
steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying
free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of
something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The
ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and
classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.
