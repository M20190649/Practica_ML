Correlated disorder in myelinated axons orientational geometry and
  structure
While the ultrastructure of the myelin has been considered to be a
quasi-crystalline stable system, nowadays its multiscale complex dynamics
appears to play a key role for its functionality, degeneration and repair
processes following neurological diseases and trauma. In this work, we have
investigated the axons interactions associated to the nerve functionality,
measuring the spatial distribution of the orientational fluctuations of axons
in a Xenopus Laevis sciatic nerve. At this aim, we have used Scanning micro
X-ray Diffraction (SmXRD), a non-invasive already applied to other
heterogeneous systems presenting complex geometries from microscale to
nanoscale. We have found that the orientational spatial fluctuations of fresh
axons show a correlated disorder described by Levy flight distribution. Thus,
we have studied how this correlated disorder evolves during the degeneration of
the nerve. Our results show that the spatial distribution of axons
orientational fluctuations in unfresh, aged nerve loose the correlated disorder
assuming a randomly disordered behaviour. This work allows a deeper
understanding of nerve states and paves the way to study other materials and
biomaterials with the same technique to detect and to characterize their states
and supramolecular structure, associated with dynamic structural changes at the
nanoscale and mesoscale.
