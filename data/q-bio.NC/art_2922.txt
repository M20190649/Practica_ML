Dynamic signal tracking in a simple V1 spiking model
This work is part of an effort to understand the neural basis for our visual
system's ability, or failure, to accurately track moving visual signals. We
consider here a ring model of spiking neurons, intended as a simplified
computational model of a single hypercolumn of the primary visual cortex.
Signals that consist of edges with time-varying orientations localized in space
are considered. Our model is calibrated to produce spontaneous and driven
firing rates roughly consistent with experiments, and our two main findings,
for which we offer dynamical explanation on the level of neuronal interactions,
are the following: (1) We have documented consistent transient overshoots in
signal perception following signal switches due to emergent interactions of the
E- and I-populations, and (2) for continuously moving signals, we have found
that accuracy is considerably lower at reversals of orientation than when
continuing in the same direction (as when the signal is a rotating bar). To
measure performance, we use two metrics, called fidelity and reliability, to
compare signals reconstructed by the system to the ones presented, and to
assess trial-to-trial variability. We propose that the same population
mechanisms responsible for orientation selectivity also impose constraints on
dynamic signal tracking that manifest in perception failures consistent with
psychophysical observations.
