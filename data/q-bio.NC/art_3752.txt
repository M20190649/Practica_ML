Awaking and Sleeping a Complex Network
A network with local dynamics of logistic type is considered. We implement a
mean-field multiplicative coupling among first-neighbor nodes. When the
coupling parameter is small the dynamics is dissipated and there is no
activity: the network is {\it turned off}. For a critical value of the coupling
a non-null stable synchronized state, which represents a {\it turned on}
network, emerges. This global bifurcation is independent of the network
topology. We characterize the bistability of the system by studying how to
perform the transition, which now is topology dependent, from the active state
to that with no activity, for the particular case of a scale free network. This
could be a naive model for the {\it wakening} and {\it sleeping} of a
brain-like system.
