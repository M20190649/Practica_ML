Astrocytes: orchestrating synaptic plasticity?
Synaptic plasticity is the capacity of a preexisting connection between two
neurons to change in strength as a function of neural activity. Because
synaptic plasticity is the major candidate mechanism for learning and memory,
the elucidation of its constituting mechanisms is of crucial importance in many
aspects of normal and pathological brain function. In particular, a prominent
aspect that remains debated is how the plasticity mechanisms, that encompass a
broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, come to play together in a
concerted fashion. Here we review and discuss evidence that pinpoints to a
possible non-neuronal, glial candidate for such orchestration: the regulation
of synaptic plasticity by astrocytes.
