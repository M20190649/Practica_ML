Axonal Conduction Velocity Impacts Neuronal Network Oscillations
Increasing experimental evidence suggests that axonal action potential
conduction velocity is a highly adaptive parameter in the adult central nervous
system. Yet, the effects of this newfound plasticity on global brain dynamics
is poorly understood. In this work, we analyzed oscillations in biologically
plausible neuronal networks with different conduction velocity distributions.
Changes of 1-2 (ms) in network mean signal transmission time resulted in
substantial network oscillation frequency changes ranging in 0-120 (Hz). Our
results suggest that changes in axonal conduction velocity may significantly
affect both the frequency and synchrony of brain rhythms, which have well
established connections to learning, memory, and other cognitive processes.
