Human Sexual Dimorphism of the Relative Cerebral Area Volumes in the
  Data of the Human Connectome Project
The average human brain volume of the males is larger than that of the
females. Several MRI voxel-based morphometry studies show that the gray
matter/white matter ratio is larger in females. Here we have analyzed the
recent public release of the Human Connectome Project, and by using the
diffusion MRI data of 511 subjects (209 men and 302 women), we have found that
the relative volumes of numerous subcortical areas and the gray matter of most
cortical areas are significantly larger in women than in men. Additionally, we
have discovered differences of the strengths of the sexual correlations between
the same structures in different hemispheres.
