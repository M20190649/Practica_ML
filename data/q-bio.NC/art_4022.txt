Automated Seizure Detection: Unrecognized Challenges, Unexpected
  Insights
One of epileptology's fundamental aims is the formulation of a universal,
internally consistent seizure definition. To assess this aim's feasibility,
three signal analysis methods were applied to a seizure time series and
performance comparisons were undertaken among them and with respect to a
validated algorithm. One of the methods uses a Fisher's matrix weighted measure
of the rate of parameters change of a 2n order auto-regressive model, another
is based on the Wavelet Transform Maximum Modulus for quantification of changes
in the logarithm of the standard deviation of ECoG power and yet another
employs the ratio of short-to-long term averages computed from cortical
signals. The central finding, fluctuating concordance among all methods' output
as a function of seizure duration, uncovers unexpected hurdles in the path to a
universal definition, while furnishing relevant knowledge in the dynamical
(spectral non-stationarity and varying ictal signal complexity) and clinical
(probable attainability of consensus) domains.
