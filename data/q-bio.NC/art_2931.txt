On causality of extreme events
Multiple metrics have been developed to detect causality relations between
data describing the elements constituting complex systems, all of them
considering their evolution through time. Here we propose a metric able to
detect causality within static data sets, by analysing how extreme events in
one element correspond to the appearance of extreme events in a second one. The
metric is able to detect non- linear causalities; to analyse both
cross-sectional and longitudinal data sets; and to discriminate between real
causalities and correlations caused by confounding factors. We validate the
metric through synthetic data, dynamical and chaotic systems, and data
representing the human brain activity in a cognitive task. We further show how
the proposed metric is able to outperform classical causality metrics, provided
non-linear relationships are present and large enough data sets are available.
