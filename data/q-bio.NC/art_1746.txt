Entropy and Information in Neural Spike Trains
The nervous system represents time-dependent signals in sequences of discrete
action potentials or spikes, all spikes are identical so that information is
carried only in the spike arrival times. We show how to quantify this
information, in bits, free from any assumptions about which features of the
spike train or input waveform are most important. We apply this approach to the
analysis of experiments on a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system.
