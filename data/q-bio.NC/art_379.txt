Beyond Spikes: Neural Codes and the Chemical Vocabulary of Cognition
In this paper, I examine what I refer to as the spike doctrine, which is the
generally held belief in neuroscience that information in the brain is encoded
by sequences of neural action potentials. I present the argument that specific
neurochemicals, and not spikes, are the elementary units of information in the
brain. I outline several predictions that arise from this interpretation,
relate them to results in the current research literature, and show how they
address some open questions.
