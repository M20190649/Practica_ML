Capacity limitations of visual search in deep convolutional neural
  network
Deep convolutional neural networks follow roughly the architecture of
biological visual systems, and have shown a performance comparable to human
observers in object recognition tasks. In this study, I test a pre-trained deep
neural network in some classic visual search tasks. The results reveal a
qualitative difference from human performance. It appears that there is no
difference between searches for simple features that pop out in experiments
with humans, and for feature configurations that exhibit strict capacity
limitations in human vision. Both types of stimuli reveal moderate capacity
limitations in the neural network tested here.
