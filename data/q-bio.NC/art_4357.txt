Self-tracking Energy Transfer for Neural Stimulation in Untethered Mice
Optical or electrical stimulation of neural circuits in mice during natural
behavior is an important paradigm for studying brain function. Conventional
systems for optogenetics and electrical microstimulation require tethers or
large head-mounted devices that disrupt animal behavior. We report a method for
wireless powering of small-scale implanted devices based on the strong
localization of energy that occurs during resonant interaction between a
radio-frequency cavity and intrinsic modes in mice. The system features
self-tracking over a wide (16 cm diameter) operational area, and is used to
demonstrate wireless activation of cortical neurons with miniaturized
stimulators (10 mm$^{3}$, 20 mg) fully implanted under the skin.
