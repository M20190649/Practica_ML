Modular dynamical systems on networks
We propose a new framework for the study of continuous time dynamical systems
on networks. We view such dynamical systems as collections of interacting
control systems. We show that a class of maps between graphs called graph
fibrations give rise to maps between dynamical systems on networks. This allows
us to produce conjugacy between dynamical systems out of combinatorial data. In
particular we show that surjective graph fibrations lead to synchrony subspaces
in networks. The injective graph fibrations, on the other hand, give rise to
surjective maps from large dynamical systems to smaller ones. One can view
these surjections as a kind of "fast/slow" variable decompositions or as
"abstractions" in the computer science sense of the word.
