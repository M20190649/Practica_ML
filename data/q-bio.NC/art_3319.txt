Predicting neural network dynamics via graphical analysis
Neural network models in neuroscience allow one to study how the connections
between neurons shape the activity of neural circuits in the brain. In this
chapter, we study Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks (CTLNs) in order to
understand how the pattern of connectivity, as encoded by a directed graph,
shapes the emergent nonlinear dynamics of the corresponding network. Important
aspects of these dynamics are controlled by the stable and unstable fixed
points of the network, and we show how these fixed points can be determined via
graph-based rules. We also present an algorithm for predicting sequences of
neural activation from the underlying directed graph, and examine the effect of
graph symmetries on a network's set of attractors.
