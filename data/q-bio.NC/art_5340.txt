Topological Data Analysis of Task-Based fMRI Data from Experiments on
  Schizophrenia
We use methods from computational algebraic topology to study functional
brain networks, in which nodes represent brain regions and weighted edges
represent similarity of fMRI time series from each region. With these tools,
which allow one to characterize topological invariants such as loops in
high-dimensional data, we are able to gain understanding into low-dimensional
structures in networks in a way that complements traditional approaches based
on pairwise interactions. In the present paper, we analyze networks constructed
from task-based fMRI data from schizophrenia patients, healthy controls, and
healthy siblings of schizophrenia patients using persistent homology, which
allows us to explore the persistence of topological structures such as loops at
different scales in the networks. We use persistence landscapes, persistence
images, and Betti curves to create output summaries from our
persistent-homology calculations, and we study the persistence landscapes and
images using $k$-means clustering and community detection. Based on our
analysis of persistence landscapes, we find that the members of the sibling
cohort have topological features (specifically, their 1-dimensional loops) that
are distinct from the other two cohorts. From the persistence images, we are
able to distinguish all three subject groups and to determine the brain regions
in the loops (with four or more edges) that allow us to make these
distinctions.
