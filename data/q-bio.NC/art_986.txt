Temporal meta-states are associated with differential patterns of
  dynamic connectivity, network topology and attention
Little is currently known about the coordination of neural activity over
longitudinal time-scales and how these changes relate to behavior. To
investigate this issue, we used resting-state fMRI data from a single
individual to identify the presence of two distinct temporal states that
fluctuated over the course of 18 months. We then demonstrated that these
temporal states were associated with distinct neural dynamics within individual
scanning sessions. In addition, the temporal states were also related to
significant alterations in global efficiency, as well as differences in
self-reported attention. These patterns were replicated in a separate
longitudinal dataset, providing further supportive evidence for the presence of
fluctuations in functional network topology over time. Together, our results
underscore the importance of longitudinal phenotyping in cognitive
neuroscience.
