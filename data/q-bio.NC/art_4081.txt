A power-law distribution of phase-locking intervals does not imply
  critical interaction
Neural synchronisation plays a critical role in information processing,
storage and transmission. Characterising the pattern of synchronisation is
therefore of great interest. It has recently been suggested that the brain
displays broadband criticality based on two measures of synchronisation - phase
locking intervals and global lability of synchronisation - showing power law
statistics at the critical threshold in a classical model of synchronisation.
In this paper, we provide evidence that, within the limits of the model
selection approach used to ascertain the presence of power law statistics, the
pooling of pairwise phase-locking intervals from a non-critically interacting
system can produce a distribution that is similarly assessed as being power
law. In contrast, the global lability of synchronisation measure is shown to
better discriminate critical from non critical interaction.
