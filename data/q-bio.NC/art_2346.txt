Frequency dependence of signal power and spatial reach of the local
  field potential
The first recording of electrical potential from brain activity was reported
already in 1875, but still the interpretation of the signal is debated. To take
full advantage of the new generation of microelectrodes with hundreds or even
thousands of electrode contacts, an accurate quantitative link between what is
measured and the underlying neural circuit activity is needed. Here we address
the question of how the observed frequency dependence of recorded local field
potentials (LFPs) should be interpreted. By use of a well-established
biophysical modeling scheme, combined with detailed reconstructed neuronal
morphologies, we find that correlations in the synaptic inputs onto a
population of pyramidal cells may significantly boost the low-frequency
components of the generated LFP. We further find that these low-frequency
components may be less `local' than the high-frequency LFP components in the
sense that (1) the size of signal-generation region of the LFP recorded at an
electrode is larger and (2) that the LFP generated by a synaptically activated
population spreads further outside the population edge due to volume
conduction.
