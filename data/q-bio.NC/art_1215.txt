How sustainable are different levels of consciousness?
The human brain processes a wide variety of inputs and does so either
consciously or subconsciously. According to the Global Workspace theory,
conscious processing involves broadcasting of information to several regions of
the brain and subconscious processing involves more localized processing. This
theoretical paper aims to expand on some of the aspects of the Global Workspace
theory: how the properties of incoming information result in it being processed
subconsciously or consciously; why processing can be either be sustained or
short-lived; how the Global Workspace theory may apply both to real-time
sensory input as well as to internally retained information. This paper
proposes that: familiar input which does not elicit intense emotions becomes
processed subconsciously and such processing can be continuous and sustained;
input that elicits relatively intense emotions is subjected to highly
sustainable conscious processing; input can also undergo meta-conscious
processing. Such processing is not very sustainable but can exert control over
other cognitive processes. This paper also discusses possible benefits of
regulating cognitive processes this way.
