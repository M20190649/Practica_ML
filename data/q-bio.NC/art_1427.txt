Why the brain knows more than we do: non-conscious representations and
  their role in the construction of conscious experience
Scientific studies have shown that non-conscious stimuli and representations
influence information processing during conscious experience. In the light of
such evidence, questions about potential functional links between non-conscious
brain representations and conscious experience arise. This article discusses a
neural coding model capable of explaining how statistical learning mechanisms
in dedicated resonant circuits could generate specific temporal activity traces
of non-conscious representations in the brain. How reentrant signaling,
top-down matching, and statistical coincidence of such activity traces may lead
to the progressive consolidation of temporal patterns that constitute the
neural signatures of conscious experience in networks extending across large
distances beyond functionally specialized brain regions is then explained.
