On the Relation between Encoding and Decoding of Neuronal Spikes
Neural coding is a field of study that concerns how sensory information is
represented in the brain by networks of neurons. The link between external
stimulus and neural response can be studied from two parallel points of view.
The first, neural encoding refers to the mapping from stimulus to response, and
primarily focuses on understanding how neurons respond to a wide variety of
stimuli, and on constructing models that accurately describe the
stimulus-response relationship. Neural decoding, on the other hand, refers to
the reverse mapping, from response to stimulus, where the challenge is to
reconstruct a stimulus from the spikes it evokes. Since neuronal response is
stochastic, a one-to-one mapping of stimuli into neural responses does not
exist, causing a mismatch between the two viewpoints of neural coding. Here, we
use these two perspectives to investigate the question of what rate coding is,
in the simple setting of a single stationary stimulus parameter and a single
stationary spike train represented by a renewal process. We show that when rate
codes are defined in terms of encoding, i.e., the stimulus parameter is mapped
onto the mean firing rate, the rate decoder given by spike counts or the sample
mean, does not always efficiently decode the rate codes, but can improve
efficiency in reading certain rate codes, when correlations within a spike
train are taken into account.
