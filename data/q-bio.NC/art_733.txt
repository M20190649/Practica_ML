Lack of appropriate controls leads to mistaking absence seizures for
  post-traumatic epilepsy
Here we provide a thorough discussion of a rebuttal by D'Ambrosio et al to a
study conducted by Rodgers et al. (Rodgers KM, Dudek FE, Barth DS (2015)
Progressive, Seizure-Like, Spike- Wave Discharges Are Common in Both Injured
and Uninjured Sprague-Dawley Rats: Implications for the Fluid Percussion Injury
Model of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy. J Neurosci. 35(24):9194-204. doi:
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0919-15.2015.) to investigate focal seizures and acquired
epileptogenesis induced by head injury in the rat. This manuscript serves as
supplementary document for our letter to the Editor to appear in the Journal of
Neuroscience. We find the rebuttal is flawed on all points, particularly
concerning use of proper controls, experimental methods, analytical methods,
and epilepsy diagnostic criteria, leading to mistaking absence seizures for
post-traumatic epilepsy.
