An inversion method based on random sampling for real-time MEG
  neuroimaging
The MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) has gained great interest in
neurorehabilitation training due to its high temporal resolution. The challenge
is to localize the active regions of the brain in a fast and accurate way. In
this paper we use an inversion method based on random spatial sampling to solve
the real-time MEG inverse problem. Several numerical tests on synthetic but
realistic data show that the method takes just a few hundredths of a second on
a laptop to produce an accurate map of the electric activity inside the brain.
Moreover, it requires very little memory storage. For this reasons the random
sampling method is particularly attractive in real-time MEG applications.
