Reinforcement Learning Models of Human Behavior: Reward Processing in
  Mental Disorders
Drawing an inspiration from behavioral studies of human decision making, we
propose here a general parametric framework for a reinforcement learning
problem, which extends the standard Q-learning approach to incorporate a
two-stream framework of reward processing with biases biologically associated
with several neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's diseases, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
addiction, and chronic pain. For AI community, the development of agents that
react differently to different types of rewards can enable us to understand a
wide spectrum of multi-agent interactions in complex real-world socioeconomic
systems. Empirically, the proposed model outperforms Q-Learning and Double
Q-Learning in artificial scenarios with certain reward distributions and
real-world human decision making gambling tasks. Moreover, from the behavioral
modeling perspective, our parametric framework can be viewed as a first step
towards a unifying computational model capturing reward processing
abnormalities across multiple mental conditions and user preferences in
long-term recommendation systems.
