Closed Form Jitter Analysis of Neuronal Spike Trains
Interval jitter and spike resampling methods are used to analyze the time
scale on which temporal correlations occur. They allow the computation of
jitter corrected cross correlograms and the performance of an associated
statistically robust hypothesis test to decide whether observed correlations at
a given time scale are significant. Currently used Monte Carlo methods
approximate the probability distribution of coincidences. They require
generating $N_{\rm MC}$ simulated spike trains of length $T$ and calculating
their correlation with another spike train up to lag $\tau_{\max}$. This is
computationally costly $O(N_{\rm MC} \times T \times \tau_{\max})$ and it
introduces errors in estimating the $p$ value. Instead, we propose to compute
the distribution in closed form, with a complexity of $O(C_{\max}
\log(C_{\max}) \tau_{\max})$, where $C_{\max}$ is the maximum possible number
of coincidences. All results are then exact rather than approximate, and as a
consequence, the $p$-values obtained are the theoretically best possible for
the available data and test statistic. In addition, simulations with realistic
parameters predict a speed increase over Monte Carlo methods of two orders of
magnitude for hypothesis testing, and four orders of magnitude for computing
the full jitter-corrected cross correlogram.
