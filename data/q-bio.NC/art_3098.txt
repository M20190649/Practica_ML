Convex Neural Codes in Dimension 1
Neural codes are collections of binary strings motivated by patterns of
neural activity. In this paper, we study algorithmic and enumerative aspects of
convex neural codes in dimension 1 (i.e. on a line or a circle). We use the
theory of consecutive-ones matrices to obtain some structural and algorithmic
results; we use generating functions to obtain enumerative results.
