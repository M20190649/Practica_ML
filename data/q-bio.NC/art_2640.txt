PrAGMATiC: a Probabilistic and Generative Model of Areas Tiling the
  Cortex
Much of the human cortex seems to be organized into topographic cortical
maps. Yet few quantitative methods exist for characterizing these maps. To
address this issue we developed a modeling framework that can reveal
group-level cortical maps based on neuroimaging data. PrAGMATiC, a
probabilistic and generative model of areas tiling the cortex, is a
hierarchical Bayesian generative model of cortical maps. This model assumes
that the cortical map in each individual subject is a sample from a single
underlying probability distribution. Learning the parameters of this
distribution reveals the properties of a cortical map that are common across a
group of subjects while avoiding the potentially lossy step of co-registering
each subject into a group anatomical space. In this report we give a
mathematical description of PrAGMATiC, describe approximations that make it
practical to use, show preliminary results from its application to a real
dataset, and describe a number of possible future extensions.
