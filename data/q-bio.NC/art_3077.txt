A theoretical connection between the noisy leaky integrate-and-fire and
  escape rate models: the non-autonomous case
One of the most important challenges in mathematical neuroscience is to
properly illustrate the stochastic nature of neurons. Among different
approaches, the noisy leaky integrate-and-fire and the escape rate models are
probably the most popular. These two models are usually chosen to express
different noise action over the neural cell. In this paper we investigate the
link between the two formalisms in the case of a neuron subject to a time
dependent input. To this aim, we introduce a new general stochastic framework.
As we shall prove, our general framework entails the two already existing ones.
Our result has theoretical implications since it offers a general view upon the
two stochastic processes mostly used in neuroscience, upon the way they can be
linked, and explain their observed statistical similarity.
