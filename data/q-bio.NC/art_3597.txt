Discriminative Sleep Patterns of Alzheimer's Disease via Tensor
  Factorization
Sleep change is commonly reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and
their brain wave studies show decrease in dreaming and non-dreaming stages.
Although sleep disturbance is generally considered as a consequence of AD, it
might also be a risk factor of AD as new biological evidence shows. Leveraging
National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), we built a unique cohort of 83 cases
and 331 controls with clinical variables and EEG signals. Supervised tensor
factorization method was applied for this temporal dataset to extract
discriminative sleep patterns. Among the 30 patterns extracted, we identified 5
significant patterns (4 patterns for AD likely and 1 pattern for normal ones)
and their visual patterns provide interesting linkage to sleep with repeated
wakefulness, insomnia, epileptic seizure, and etc. This study is preliminary
but findings are interesting, which is a first step to provide quantifiable
evidences to measure sleep as a risk factor of AD.
