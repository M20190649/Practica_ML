Differences in the Brain Waves of 3D and 2.5D Motion Picture Viewers
We measured brain waves of viewers watching the 2D, 2.5D, and 3D motion
pictures, comparing them with one another. The relative intensity of
{\alpha}-frequency band of 2.5D-viewer was lower than that of 2D-viewer, while
that of 3D-viewer remained with similar intensity. This result implies visual
neuro-processing of the 2.5D-viewer differs from that of the 3D-viewer.
