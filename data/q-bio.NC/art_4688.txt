Inverse statistical problems: from the inverse Ising problem to data
  science
Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of
`big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in
biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs
to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model
parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In
this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related
problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given
observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review
applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of
neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene
regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of
controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the
statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method,
pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising
problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be
reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.
