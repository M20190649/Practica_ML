Double Inverse Stochastic Resonance with Dynamic Synapses
We investigate the behavior of a model neuron that receives a
biophysically-realistic noisy post-synaptic current based on uncorrelated
spiking activity from a large number of afferents. We show that, with static
synapses, such noise can give rise to inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) as a
function of the presynaptic firing rate. We compare this to the case with
dynamic synapses that feature short-term synaptic plasticity, and show that the
interval of presynaptic firing rate over which ISR exists can be extended or
diminished. We consider both short-term depression and facilitation.
Interestingly, we find that a double inverse stochastic resonance (DISR), with
two distinct wells centered at different presynaptic firing rates, can appear.
