The cognitive homunculus: do tunable languages-of-thought convey
  adaptive advantage?
We reexamine the generalized cognitive homunculus, an organism's internalized
image of its physiological, psychological, and social state, which, when
properly adjusted, can quickly detect subtle deviations from a reference
configuration. We particularly seek to extend the treatment beyond
'language-of-thought' systems modeled as ergodic information sources. Such
extension would generate an exceedingly rich response repertoire, not limited
by fixed patterns of grammar and syntax. Rather, these would themselves be
tunable according to the changing short-term contextual demands faced by the
organism, possibly providing significant long-term adaptive advantage.
