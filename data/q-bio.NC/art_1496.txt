Vanadium dioxide circuits emulate neurological disorders
Information in the central nervous system (CNS) is conducted via electrical
signals known as action potentials and is encoded in time. Several neurological
disorders including depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), originate in faulty brain signaling frequencies. Here, we present a
Hodgkin-Huxley model analog for a strongly correlated VO2 artificial neuron
system that undergoes an electrically-driven insulator-metal transition. We
demonstrate that tuning of the insulating phase resistance in VO2 threshold
switch circuits can enable direct mimicry of neuronal origins of disorders in
the central nervous system. The results introduce use of circuits based on
quantum materials as complementary to model animal studies for neuroscience,
especially when precise measurements of local electrical properties or
competing parallel paths for conduction in complex neural circuits can be a
challenge to identify onset of breakdown or diagnose early symptoms of disease.
