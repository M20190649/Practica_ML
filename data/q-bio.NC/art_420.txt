The Recognizability of Authenticity
The goals of this research were to (1) determine if there is agreement both
amongst viewers, and between viewers and the performer, about the extent to
which performances are authentic, and (2) ascertain whether or not performers
and/or viewers can distinguish between authenticity and skill. An authentic
performance is one that is natural or genuine, while an inauthentic performance
feels faked, forced, or imitative. Study participants were asked to rate the
authenticity and skill level of a series of videotaped performances by dancers
and stand-up comedians. Performers also rated their own performances.
Authenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated.
Ratings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A
higher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of
performances for viewers than for performers suggests that viewers make less of
a distinction between authenticity and skill than performers. The relationship
between authenticity and creativity is discussed.
