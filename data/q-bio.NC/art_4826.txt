The Temple University Hospital Seizure Detection Corpus
We introduce the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ), which is the largest open
source corpus of its type, and represents an accurate characterization of
clinical conditions. In this paper, we describe the techniques used to develop
TUSZ, evaluate their effectiveness, and present some descriptive statistics on
the resulting corpus.
