Sensory Substitution : Perception Dedicated to Action
Paul Bach Y Rita [1] is the precursor of sensory substitutions. He started
thirty years ago using visuo-tactile prostheses with the intent of satisfying
blind people. These prostheses, called Tactile Vision Substitution Systems
(TVSS), transform a sensory input from a given modality (vision) into another
modality (touch). These new systems seemed to induce quasi-visual perceptions.
One of the author's interests dealt with the understanding of the coupling
between actions and sensations in perception mechanisms [4]. Throughout his
search, he noticed that the subjects had to move the camera themselves in order
to recognise a 3D target-object or a figure placed in front of them. Our work
consists in understanding how sensory information provided by a visuo-tactile
prosthesis can be used for motor behaviour. In this aim, we used the most
simple substitution device (one photoreceptor coupled with one tactile
stimulator) in order to control and enrich our knowledge of the ties between
perception and action.
