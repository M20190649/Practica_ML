Family of closed-form solutions for two-dimensional correlated diffusion
  processes
Diffusion processes with boundaries are models of transport phenomena with
wide applicability across many fields. These processes are described by their
probability density functions (PDFs), which often obey Fokker-Planck equations
(FPEs). While obtaining analytical solutions is often possible in the absence
of boundaries, obtaining closed-form solutions to the FPE is more challenging
once absorbing boundaries are present. As a result, analyses of these processes
have largely relied on approximations or direct simulations. In this paper, we
studied two-dimensional, time-homogeneous, spatially-correlated diffusion with
linear, axis-aligned, absorbing boundaries. Our main result is the explicit
construction of a full family of closed-form solutions for their PDFs using the
method of images (MoI). We found that such solutions can be built if and only
if the correlation coefficient $\rho$ between the two diffusing processes takes
one of a numerable set of values. Using a geometric argument, we derived the
complete set of $\rho$'s where such solutions can be found. Solvable $\rho$'s
are given by $\rho = - \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{k} \right)$, where $k \in
\mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \{ +\infty\}$. Solutions were validated in simulations.
Qualitative behaviors of the process appear to vary smoothly over $\rho$,
allowing extrapolation from our solutions to cases with unsolvable $\rho$'s.
