Fractional cable equation for general geometry, a model of axons with
  swellings and anomalous diffusion
Different experimental studies have reported anomalous diffusion in brain
tissues and notably this anomalous diffusion is expressed through fractional
derivatives. Axons are important to understand neurodegenerative diseases such
as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Indeed,
abnormal accumulation of proteins and organelles in axons is a hallmark feature
of these diseases. The diffusion in the axons can become to anomalous as a
result from this abnormality. In this case the voltage propagation in axons is
affected. Another hallmark feature of different neurodegenerative diseases is
given by discrete swellings along the axon. In order to model the voltage
propagation in axons with anomalous diffusion and swellings, in this paper we
propose a fractional cable equation for general geometry. This generalized
equation depends on fractional parameters and geometric quantities such as the
curvature and torsion of the cable. For a cable with a constant radius we show
that the voltage decreases when the fractional effect increases. In cables with
swellings we find that when the fractional effect or the swelling radius
increase, the voltage decreases. A similar behavior is obtained when the number
of swellings and the fractional effect increase. Moreover, we find that when
the radius swelling (or the number of swellings) and the fractional effect
increase at the same time, the voltage dramatically decreases.
