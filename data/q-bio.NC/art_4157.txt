Neuronal Alignment On Asymmetric Textured Surfaces
Axonal growth and the formation of synaptic connections are key steps in the
development of the nervous system. Here we present experimental and theoretical
results on axonal growth and interconnectivity in order to elucidate some of
the basic rules that neuronal cells use for functional connections with one
another. We demonstrate that a unidirectional nanotextured surface can bias
axonal growth. We perform a systematic investigation of neuronal processes on
asymmetric surfaces and quantify the role that biomechanical surface cues play
in neuronal growth. These results represent an important step towards
engineering directed axonal growth for neuro-regeneration studies.
