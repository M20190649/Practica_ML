Properties of IA in a serotonergic neuron of the dorsal raphe nucleus
Voltage clamp data were analyzed in order to characterize the properties of
the fast potassium transient current IA for a serotonergic neuron of the rat
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We obtain maximal conductance, time constants of
activation and inactivation, and the steady state activation and inactivation
functions, as Boltzmann curves, defined by half-activation potentials and slope
factors. We employ a novel method to accurately obtain the activation function
and compare the results with those obtained by other methods. The form of IA is
estimated as g(V-V_{rev}) m^4h with g=20.5 nS. For activation, the
half-activation potential is V_a=-52.5 mV with slope factor k_a=16.5 mV,
whereas for inactivation the corresponding quantities are -91.5 mV and -9.3 mV.
We discuss the results in terms of the corresponding properties of \IA in other
cell types and their possible relevance to pacemaking activity in 5-HT cells of
the DRN.
