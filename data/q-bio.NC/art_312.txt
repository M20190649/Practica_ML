The information content of Local Field Potentials: experiments and
  models
The LFPs is a broadband signal that captures variations of neural population
activity over a wide range of time scales. The range of time scales available
in LFPs is particularly interesting from the neural coding point of view
because it opens up the possibility to investigate whether there are privileged
time scales for information processing, a question that has been hotly debated
over the last one or two decades.It is possible that information is represented
by only a small number of specific frequency ranges, each carrying a separate
contribution to the information representation. To shed light on this issue, it
is important to quantify the information content of each frequency range of
neural activity, and understand which ranges carry complementary or similar
information.
