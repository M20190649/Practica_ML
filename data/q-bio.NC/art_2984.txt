A negative group delay model for feedback-delayed manual tracking
We propose that feedback-delayed manual tracking performance is limited by
fundamental constraints imposed by the physics of negative group delay. To test
this hypothesis, the results of an experiment in which subjects demonstrate
both reactive and predictive dynamics are modeled by a linear system with
delay-induced negative group delay. Although one of the simplest real-time
predictors conceivable, this model explains key components of experimental
observations. Most notably, it explains the observation that prediction time
linearly increases with feedback delay, up to a certain point when tracking
performance deteriorates. It also explains the transition from reactive to
predictive behavior with increasing feedback delay. The model contains only one
free parameter, the feedback gain, which has been fixed by comparison with one
set of experimental observations for the reactive case. Our model provides
quantitative predictions that can be tested in further experiments.
