Distributed synaptic weights in a LIF neural network and learning rules
Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models are mean-field limits, with a large
number of neurons, used to describe neural networks. We consider inhomogeneous
networks structured by a connec-tivity parameter (strengths of the synaptic
weights) with the effect of processing the input current with different
intensities. We first study the properties of the network activity depending on
the distribution of synaptic weights and in particular its discrimination
capacity. Then, we consider simple learning rules and determine the synaptic
weight distribution it generates. We outline the role of noise as a selection
principle and the capacity to memorized a learned signal.
