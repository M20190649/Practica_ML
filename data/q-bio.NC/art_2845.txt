Data assimilation for estimating electrophysiology simultaneously with
  connectivity within a biological neuronal network
A method of data assimilation (DA) is employed to estimate
electrophysiological parameters of neurons simultaneously with their synaptic
connectivity in a small model biological network. The DA procedure is cast as
an optimization, where the cost function consists of both a measurement and a
model error term. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a systematic
method to identify the lowest minimum, within a local region of state space, on
the surface of a non-convex cost function. Two sets of parameter values are
associated with two particular functional modes of network activity:
simultaneous firing of all neurons, and a pattern-generating mode wherein the
neurons burst in sequence. The DA procedure is able to recover these modes if:
i) the stimulating electrical currents have chaotic waveforms, and ii) the
measurements consist of the membrane voltages of all neurons in the circuit.
Further, this method is able to prune a model of unnecessarily high complexity
down to a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality required to
reproduce the available measurements. The utility of DA for exploring the
functionality of real biological networks is discussed. This paper offers a
proof-of-concept that DA has the potential to estimate properties in extremely
small and isolatable functional circuits.
