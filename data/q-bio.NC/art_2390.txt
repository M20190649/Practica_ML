Inhibition causes ceaseless dynamics in networks of excitable nodes
The collective dynamics of a network of excitable nodes changes dramatically
when inhibitory nodes are introduced. We consider inhibitory nodes which may be
activated just like excitatory nodes but, upon activating, decrease the
probability of activation of network neighbors. We show that, although the
direct effect of inhibitory nodes is to decrease activity, the collective
dynamics becomes self-sustaining. We explain this counterintuitive result by
defining and analyzing a "branching function" which may be thought of as an
activity-dependent branching ratio. The shape of the branching function implies
that for a range of global coupling parameters dynamics are self-sustaining.
Within the self-sustaining region of parameter space lies a critical line along
which dynamics take the form of avalanches with universal scaling of size and
duration, embedded in ceaseless timeseries of activity. Our analyses, confirmed
by numerical simulation, suggest that inhibition may play a counterintuitive
role in excitable networks.
