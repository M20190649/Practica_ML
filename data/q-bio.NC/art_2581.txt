Complementary action of chemical and electrical synapses to perception
We study the dynamic range of a cellular automaton model for a neuronal
network with electrical and chemical synapses. The neural network is separated
into two layers, where one layer corresponds to inhibitory, and the other
corresponds to excitatory neurons. We randomly distribute electrical synapses
in the network, in order to analyse the effects on the dynamic range. We verify
that electrical synapses have a complementary effect on the enhancement of the
dynamic range. The enhancement depends on the proportion of electrical
synapses, and also depends on the layer where they are distributed.
