Two's company, three (or more) is a simplex: Algebraic-topological tools
  for understanding higher-order structure in neural data
The language of graph theory, or network science, has proven to be an
exceptional tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use
of networks is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the
quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad -- two nodes (neurons or
brain regions) connected by an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental
assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that
graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that
overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new
possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena.
Specifically, we explore the use of \emph{simplicial complexes}, a theoretical
notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which
is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational
toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding
literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from
electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in
humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent
ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has
the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries
of cognition.
