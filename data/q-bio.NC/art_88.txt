Perception proximale et distale Ã  l'aide du dispositif de Lenay
We present in this article experimental results obtained with the "dispositif
de Lenay" : for a localization task (distal perception) and an orientation
estimation task (proximal perception of the orientation of a cylinder in a
plane). In this last experiment, a "virtual" version of the Lenay device was
used. Results are here used to illustrate methodological and theoretical
proposals for the study of cognitive and sensori-motor processes involved in
perception.
