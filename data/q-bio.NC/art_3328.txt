Asymmetrical voltage response in resonant neurons shaped by
  nonlinearities
The conventional impedance profile of a neuron can identify its resonant
properties, even though this measure can not distinguish situations where the
output signal is nonlinear. Experimental observations have shown that the
response of neurons to oscillatory inputs in different frequencies
preferentially enhances either the upper or lower part of the voltage envelope.
Here we show that this asymmetric voltage response can arise by submitting a
neuron model to high amplitude oscillatory currents of variable frequencies. We
show how nonlinearities associated to different ionic currents or voltage
equations can lead to asymmetrical response and propose a geometrical
explanation for the phenomenon based on their activation curves. In addition,
we identify an unexpected frequency-dependent pattern which develops in the
gating variables of these currents and is a product of strong nonlinearities in
the system. The results reported in this paper could be used by a brain
embedded neuron to discriminate an oscillatory frequency dependent input to
upper or lower enhanced voltage response.
