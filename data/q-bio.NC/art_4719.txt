Control of a hair bundle's mechanosensory function by its mechanical
  load
Hair cells, the sensory receptors of the internal ear, subserve different
functions in various receptor organs: they detect oscillatory stimuli in the
auditory system, but transduce constant and step stimuli in the vestibular and
lateral-line systems. We show that a hair cell's function can be controlled
experimentally by adjusting its mechanical load. By making bundles from a
single organ operate as any of four distinct types of signal detector, we
demonstrate that altering only a few key parameters can fundamentally change a
sensory cell's role. The motions of a single hair bundle can resemble those of
a bundle from the amphibian vestibular system, the reptilian auditory system,
or the mammalian auditory system, demonstrating an essential similarity of
bundles across species and receptor organs.
