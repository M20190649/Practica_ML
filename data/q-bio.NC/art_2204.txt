Toward molecular neuroeconomics of obesity
Because obesity is a risk factor for many serious illnesses such as diabetes,
better understandings of obesity and eating disorders have been attracting
attention in neurobiology, psychiatry, and neuroeconomics. This paper presents
future study directions by unifying (i) economic theory of addiction and
obesity (Becker and Murphy, 1988; Levy 2002; Dragone 2009), and (ii) recent
empirical findings in neuroeconomics and neurobiology of obesity and addiction.
It is suggested that neurobiological substrates such as adiponectin, dopamine
(D2 receptors), endocannabinoids, ghrelin, leptin, nesfatin-1, norepinephrine,
orexin, oxytocin, serotonin, vasopressin, CCK, GLP-1, MCH, PYY, and stress
hormones (e.g., CRF) in the brain (e.g., OFC, VTA, NAcc, and the hypothalamus)
may determine parameters in the economic theory of obesity. Also, the
importance of introducing time-inconsistent and gain/loss-asymmetrical temporal
discounting (intertemporal choice) models based on Tsallis' statistics and
incorporating time-perception parameters into the neuroeconomic theory is
emphasized. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in
neuroeconomics and neuropsychiatry of obesity at the molecular level, which may
help medical/psychopharmacological treatments of obesity (e.g., with
sibutramine), are discussed.
