Let us first agree on what the term "semantics" means: An unorthodox
  approach to an age-old debate
Traditionally, semantics has been seen as a feature of human language. The
advent of the information era has led to its widespread redefinition as an
information feature. Contrary to this praxis, I define semantics as a special
kind of information. Revitalizing the ideas of Bar-Hillel and Carnap I have
recreated and re-established the notion of semantics as the notion of Semantic
Information. I have proposed a new definition of information (as a description,
a linguistic text, a piece of a story or a tale) and a clear segregation
between two different types of information - physical and semantic information.
I hope, I have clearly explained the (usually obscured and mysterious)
interrelations between data and physical information as well as the relation
between physical information and semantic information. Consequently, usually
indefinable notions of "information", "knowledge", "memory", "learning" and
"semantics" have also received their suitable illumination and explanation.
