Motif Statistics and Spike Correlations in Neuronal Networks
Motifs are patterns of subgraphs of complex networks. We studied the impact
of such patterns of connectivity on the level of correlated, or synchronized,
spiking activity among pairs of cells in a recurrent network model of integrate
and fire neurons. For a range of network architectures, we find that the
pairwise correlation coefficients, averaged across the network, can be closely
approximated using only three statistics of network connectivity. These are the
overall network connection probability and the frequencies of two second-order
motifs: diverging motifs, in which one cell provides input to two others, and
chain motifs, in which two cells are connected via a third intermediary cell.
Specifically, the prevalence of diverging and chain motifs tends to increase
correlation. Our method is based on linear response theory, which enables us to
express spiking statistics using linear algebra, and a resumming technique,
which extrapolates from second order motifs to predict the overall effect of
coupling on network correlation. Our motif-based results seek to isolate the
effect of network architecture perturbatively from a known network state.
