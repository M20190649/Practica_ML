The eddy current distortion in the multiband diffusion images: diagnosis
  and correction
The diffusion weighted images acquired with the multiband sequence or the
Lifespan protocols shows a type of slice distortion artifact. We find that this
artifact is caused by the eddy currents, which can be induced by the diffusion
gradient associated with either current DW image or the previous DW images. The
artifact can be corrected by further tuning the compensation circuit in the MR
hardware, or by a correction algorithm which includes the diffusion gradients
from the current and previous DW images.
