Digital System Reconstruction by Pairwise Transfer Entropy
Transfer entropy (TE) is an attractive model-free method to detect causality
and infer structural connectivity of general digital systems. However it relies
on high dimensions used in its definition to clearly remove the memory effect
and distinguish the direct causality from the indirect ones which makes it
almost inoperable in practice. In this work, we try to use a low order and
pairwise TE framework with binary data suitably filtered from the recorded
signals to avoid the high dimensional problem. Under this setting, we find and
explain that the TE values from the connected and unconnected pairs have a
significant difference of magnitude, which can be easily classified by cluster
methods. This phenomenon widely and robustly holds over a wide range of systems
and dynamical regimes. In addition, we find the TE value is quadratically
related to the coupling strength and thus we can establish a quantitative
mapping between the causal and structural connectivity.
