Implementing robust neuromodulation in neuromorphic circuits
We introduce a methodology to implement the physiological transition {between
distinct neuronal spiking modes} in electronic circuits composed of resistors,
capacitors and transistors. The result is a simple neuromorphic device
organized by the same geometry {and exhibiting the same input--output
properties as} high-dimensional electrophysiological neuron models.
{Preliminary} experimental results highlight the robustness of the approach in
real-world applications.
