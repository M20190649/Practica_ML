Griffiths phase and long-range correlations in a biologically motivated
  V1 model
Activity in the brain propagates as waves of firing neurons, namely
avalanches. These waves' size and duration distributions have been
experimentally shown to display a stable power-law profile, long-range
correlations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in
vitro}. We study an avalanching biologically motivated model of mammals visual
cortex and find an extended critical-like region -- a Griffiths phase --
characterized by divergent susceptibility and zero order parameter. This phase
lies close to the expected experimental value of the \textit{excitatory
postsynaptic potential} in the cortex suggesting that critical behavior may be
found in the visual system. Avalanches are not perfectly power-law distributed,
but it is possible to collapse the distributions and define a cutoff avalanche
size that diverges as the network size is increased inside the critical region.
The avalanches present long-range correlations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum,
matching experiments. The phase transition is analytically determined by a
mean-field approximation.
