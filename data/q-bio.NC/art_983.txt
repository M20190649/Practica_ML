Bursty and persistent properties of large-scale brain networks revealed
  with a point-based method for dynamic functional connectivity
In this paper, we present a novel and versatile method to study the dynamics
of resting-state fMRI brain connectivity with a high temporal sensitivity.
Whereas most existing methods often rely on dividing the time-series into
larger segments of data (i.e. so called sliding window techniques), the
point-based method (PBM) proposed here provides an estimate of brain
connectivity at the level of individual sampled time-points. The achieved
increase in temporal sensitivity, together with temporal graph network theory
allowed us to study functional integration between, as well as within,
resting-state networks. Our results show that functional integrations between
two resting-state networks predominately occurs in bursts of activity with
intermittent periods of less connectivity, whereas the functional connectivity
within resting-state networks is characterized by a tonic/periodic connectivity
pattern. Moreover, the point-based approach allowed us to estimate the
persistency of brain connectivity, i.e. the duration of the intrinsic trace or
memory of resting-state connectivity patterns. The described point-based method
of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity allows for a detailed and
expanded view on the temporal dynamics of resting-state connectivity that
provides novel insights into how neuronal information processing is integrated
in the human brain at the level of large-scale networks.
