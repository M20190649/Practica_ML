What deep learning can tell us about higher cognitive functions like
  mindreading?
Can deep learning (DL) guide our understanding of computations happening in
biological brain? We will first briefly consider how DL has contributed to the
research on visual object recognition. In the main part we will assess whether
DL could also help us to clarify the computations underlying higher cognitive
functions such as Theory of Mind. In addition, we will compare the objectives
and learning signals of brains and machines, leading us to conclude that simply
scaling up the current DL algorithms will most likely not lead to human level
Theory of Mind.
