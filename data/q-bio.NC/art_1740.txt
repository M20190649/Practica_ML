Carbogen inhalation during Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus: A
  quantitative analysis of EEG recordings
Objective: To quantify the effect of inhaled 5% carbon-dioxide/95% oxygen on
EEG recordings from patients in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).
Methods: Five children of mixed aetiology in NCSE were given high flow of
inhaled carbogen (5% carbon dioxide/95% oxygen) using a face mask for maximum
120s. EEG was recorded concurrently in all patients. The effects of inhaled
carbogen on patient EEG recordings were investigated using band-power,
functional connectivity and graph theory measures. Carbogen effect was
quantified by measuring effect size (Cohen's d) between "before", "during" and
"after" carbogen delivery states. Results: Carbogen's apparent effect on EEG
band-power and network metrics across all patients for "before-during" and
"before-after" inhalation comparisons was inconsistent across the five
patients. Conclusion: The changes in different measures suggest a potentially
non-homogeneous effect of carbogen on the patients' EEG. Different aetiology
and duration of the inhalation may underlie these non-homogeneous effects.
Tuning the carbogen parameters (such as ratio between CO2 and O2, duration of
inhalation) on a personalised basis may improve seizure suppression in future.
