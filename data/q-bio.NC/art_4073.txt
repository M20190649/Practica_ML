A phase transition in the first passage of a Brownian process through a
  fluctuating boundary: implications for neural coding
Finding the first time a fluctuating quantity reaches a given boundary is a
deceptively simple-looking problem of vast practical importance in physics,
biology, chemistry, neuroscience, economics and industry. Problems in which the
bound to be traversed is itself a fluctuating function of time include widely
studied settings in neural coding, such as neuronal integrators with irregular
inputs and internal noise. We show that the probability p(t) that a
Gauss-Markov process will first exceed the boundary at time t suffers a phase
transition as a function of the roughness of the boundary, as measured by its
H\"older exponent H, with critical value Hc = 1/2. For smoother boundaries, H >
1/2, the probability density is a continuous func- tion of time. For rougher
boundaries, H < 1/2, the probability is concentrated on a Cantor-like set of
zero measure: the probability density becomes divergent, almost everywhere
either zero or infin- ity. The critical point Hc = 1/2 corresponds to a
widely-studied case in the theory of neural coding, where the external input
integrated by a model neuron is a white-noise process, such as uncorrelated but
precisely balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We argue this transition
corresponds to a sharp boundary between rate codes, in which the neural firing
probability varies smoothly, and temporal codes, in which the neuron fires at
sharply-defined times regardless of the intensity of internal noise.
