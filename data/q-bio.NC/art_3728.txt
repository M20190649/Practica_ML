Strength Distribution in Derivative Networks
This article describes a complex network model whose weights are proportional
to the difference between uniformly distributed ``fitness'' values assigned to
the nodes. It is shown both analytically and experimentally that the strength
density (i.e. the weighted node degree) for this model, called derivative
complex networks, follows a power law with exponent $\gamma<1$ if the fitness
has an upper limit and $\gamma>1$ if the fitness has no upper limit but a
positive lower limit. Possible implications for neuronal networks topology and
dynamics are also discussed.
