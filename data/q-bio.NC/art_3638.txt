Computing persistent homology of directed flag complexes
We present a new computing package Flagser, designed to construct the
directed flag complex of a finite directed graph, and compute persistent
homology for flexibly defined filtrations on the graph and the resulting
complex. The persistent homology computation part of Flagser is based on the
program Ripser [Bau18a], but is optimized specifically for large computations.
The construction of the directed flag complex is done in a way that allows easy
parallelization by arbitrarily many cores. Flagser also has the option of
working with undirected graphs. For homology computations Flagser has an
Approximate option, which shortens compute time with remarkable accuracy. We
demonstrate the power of Flagser by applying it to the construction of the
directed flag complex of digital reconstructions of brain microcircuitry by the
Blue Brain Project and several other examples. In some instances we perform
computation of homology. For a more complete performance analysis, we also
apply Flagser to some other data collections. In all cases the hardware used in
the computation, the use of memory and the compute time are recorded.
