Mental Wormholes and the Inner Workings of Creative Thought
Most creative outputs are readily classified as belonging to a particular
domain such as art, music, or technology. But does that mean the creative
thinking that goes into creative projects respects these conventional domain
boundaries? This question provides the departure point for this chapter. It is
an important question because the answer has implications for how the creative
process works, as well as for computational models of creativity, and thus it
provides the departure point for this chapter. Next we look at how the creator
sifts out from its vast contents those items to incorporate into a creative
project, and converts these raw materials into a form that "gels" with the
project. We then explore the hypothesis that the creative mind forges "mental
wormholes" that connect concepts and percepts, often from seemingly disparate
domains. Finally, we take a brief look at the strangely non-compositional
interactions that take place in these mental wormholes, and techniques being
advanced to model and understand these interactions.
