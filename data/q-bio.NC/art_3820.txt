Single neuron computation: from dynamical system to feature detector
White noise methods are a powerful tool for characterizing the computation
performed by neural systems. These methods allow one to identify the feature or
features that a neural system extracts from a complex input, and to determine
how these features are combined to drive the system's spiking response. These
methods have also been applied to characterize the input/output relations of
single neurons driven by synaptic inputs, simulated by direct current
injection. To interpret the results of white noise analysis of single neurons,
we would like to understand how the obtained feature space of a single neuron
maps onto the biophysical properties of the membrane, in particular the
dynamics of ion channels. Here, through analysis of a simple dynamical model
neuron, we draw explicit connections between the output of a white noise
analysis and the underlying dynamical system. We find that under certain
assumptions, the form of the relevant features is well defined by the
parameters of the dynamical system. Further, we show that under some
conditions, the feature space is spanned by the spike-triggered average and its
successive order time derivatives.
