The Gamma renewal process as an output of the diffusion leaky
  integrate-and-fire neuronal model
Statistical properties of spike trains as well as other neurophysiological
data suggest a number of mathematical models of neurons. These models range
from entirely descriptive ones to those deduced from the properties of the real
neurons. One of them, the diffusion leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model,
which is based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process that is restricted
by an absorbing barrier, can describe a wide range of neuronal activity in
terms of its parameters. These parameters are readily associated with known
physiological mechanisms. The other model is descriptive, Gamma renewal
process, and its parameters only reflect the observed experimental data or
assumed theoretical properties. Both of these commonly used models are related
here. We show under which conditions the Gamma model is an output from the
diffusion Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. In some cases we can see that the Gamma
distribution is unrealistic to be achieved for the employed parameters of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
