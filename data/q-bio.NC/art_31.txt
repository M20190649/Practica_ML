Predicting spike times of a detailed conductance-based neuron model
  driven by stochastic spike arrival
Reduced models of neuronal activity such as Integrate-and-Fire models allow a
description of neuronal dynamics in simple, intuitive terms and are easy to
simulate numerically. We present a method to fit an Integrate-and-Fire-type
model of neuronal activity, namely a modified version of the Spike Response
Model, to a detailed Hodgkin-Huxley-type neuron model driven by stochastic
spike arrival. In the Hogkin-Huxley model, spike arrival at the synapse is
modeled by a change of synaptic conductance. For such conductance spike input,
more than 70% of the postsynaptic action potentials can be predicted with the
correct timing by the Integrate-and-Fire-type model. The modified Spike
Response Model is based upon a linearized theory of conductance-driven
Integrate-and-Fire neuron.
