Modeling Response Time Distributions with Generalized Beta Prime
We use Generalized Beta Prime distribution, also known as GB2, for fitting
response time distributions. This distribution, characterized by one scale and
three shape parameters, is incredibly flexible in that it can mimic behavior of
many other distributions. GB2 exhibits power-law behavior at both front and
tail ends and is a steady-state distribution of a simple stochastic
differential equation. We apply GB2 in contrast studies between two distinct
groups -- in this case children with dyslexia and a control group -- and show
that it provides superior fitting. We compare aggregate response time
distributions of the two groups for scale and shape differences (including
several scale-independent measures of variability, such as Hoover index), which
may in turn reflect on cognitive dynamics differences. In this approach,
response time distribution of an individual can be considered as a random
variate of that individual's group distribution.
