Analyzing dynamic decision-making models using Chapman-Kolmogorov
  equations
Decision-making in dynamic environments typically requires adaptive evidence
accumulation that weights new evidence more heavily than old observations.
Recent experimental studies of dynamic decision tasks require subjects to make
decisions for which the correct choice switches stochastically throughout a
single trial. In such cases, an ideal observer's belief is described by an
evolution equation that is doubly stochastic, reflecting stochasticity in the
both observations and environmental changes. In these contexts, we show that
the probability density of the belief can be represented using differential
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, allowing efficient computation of ensemble
statistics. This allows us to reliably compare normative models to
near-normative approximations using, as model performance metrics, decision
response accuracy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of the belief distributions.
Such belief distributions could be obtained empirically from subjects by asking
them to report their decision confidence. We also study how response accuracy
is affected by additional internal noise, showing optimality requires longer
integration timescales as more noise is added. Lastly, we demonstrate that our
method can be applied to tasks in which evidence arrives in a discrete,
pulsatile fashion, rather than continuously.
