Î¼SpikeHunter: An advanced computational tool for the analysis of
  neuronal communication and action potential propagation in microfluidic
  platforms
Understanding neuronal communication is fundamental in neuroscience but there
are few methodologies offering detailed analysis for well-controlled
conditions. By interfacing microElectrode arrays with microFluidics ({\mu}EF
devices), it is possible to compartmentalize neuronal cultures with a specified
alignment of axons and microelectrodes. This setup allows extracellular
recordings of spike propagation with high signal-to-noise ratio over the course
of several weeks. Addressing these {\mu}EF systems we developed an advanced,
yet easy-to-use, open-source computational tool, {\mu}SpikeHunter, which
provides detailed quantification of several communication-related properties
such as propagation velocity, conduction failure, spike timings, and coding
mechanisms. The combination of {\mu}EF devices and {\mu}SpikeHunter can be used
in the context of standard neuronal cultures or with co-culture configurations
where, for example, communication between sensory neurons and other cell types
is monitored and assessed. The ability to analyze axonal signals (in a
user-friendly, time-efficient, high-throughput manner) opens doors to new
approaches to studies of peripheral innervation, neural coding, and
neuroregeneration approaches, among many others. We demonstrate the use of
{\mu}SpikeHunter in dorsal root ganglion neurons where we analyze the presence
of anterograde signals in {\mu}EF devices.
