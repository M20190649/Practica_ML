Comorbidity and Anticomorbidity: Autocognitive developmental disorders
  of structured psychosocial stress
We examine interacting cognitive modules of human biology which, in the
asymptotic limit of long sequences of responses, define the output of an
appropriate 'dual' information source. Applying a 'necessary condition'
communication theory formalism roughly similar to that of Dretske, but focused
entirely on long sequences of signals, we examine the regularities apparent in
comorbid psychiatric and chronic physical disorders using an extension of
recent perspectives on autoimmune disease. We find that structured psychosocial
stress can literally write a distorted image of itself onto child development,
resulting in a life course trajectory to characteristic forms of comorbid
mind/body dysfunction affecting both dominant and subordinate populations
within a pathogenic social hierarchy.
