How stochastic synchrony could work in cerebellar Purkinje cells
Simple spike synchrony between Purkinje cells projecting to a common neuron
in the deep cerebellar nucleus is emerging as an important factor in the
encoding of output information from cerebellar cortex. Stochastic
synchronization is a viable mechanism through which this synchrony could be
generated, but it has received scarce attention, perhaps because the presence
of feedforward inhibition in the input to Purkinje cells makes insights
difficult. This paper presents a method to account for feedforward inhibition
so the usual mathematical approaches to stochastic synchronization can be
applied. Three concepts (input correlation, heterogeneity, and PRC shape) are
then introduced to facilitate an intuitive understanding of how different
factors can affect synchronization in Purkinje cells. This is followed by a
discussion of how stochastic synchrony could play a role in the cerebellar
response under different assumptions.
