The OpenPicoAmp : an open-source planar lipid bilayer amplifier for
  hands-on learning of neuroscience
Neuroscience education can be promoted by the availability of low cost and
engaging teaching materials. To address this issue, we developed an open-source
lipid bilayer amplifier, the OpenPicoAmp, which is appropriate for use in
introductory courses in biophysics or neurosciences dealing with the electrical
properties of the cell membrane. The amplifier is designed using the common
lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf
electronic components. In addition, we propose a specific design for
experimental chambers allowing the insertion of a commercially available
polytetrafluoroethylene film. This experimental setup can be used in simple
experiments in which students monitor the bilayer formation by capacitance
measurement and record unitary currents produced by ionic channels like
gramicidin A. Used in combination with a low-cost data acquisition board this
system provides a complete solution for hands-on lessons, therefore improving
the effectiveness in teaching basic neurosciences or biophysics.
