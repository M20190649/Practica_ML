Spatial Auditory Brain-computer Interface using Head Related Impulse
  Response
This study reports on a head related impulse response (HRIR) application to
an auditory spatial brain-computer interface (BCI) speller paradigm. Six
experienced and five BCI-naive users participated in an experimental spelling
set up based on five Japanese vowels. Obtained auditory evoked potentials
resulted with encouragingly good and stable P300-responses in online BCI
experiments. Our case study indicated that the headphone reproduced auditory
(HRIR- based) spatial sound paradigm could be a viable alternative to the
established multi-loudspeaker surround sound BCI-speller applications, as far
as healthy pilot study users are concerned.
