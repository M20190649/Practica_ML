Quantum effects in linguistic endeavors
Classifying the information content of neural spike trains in a linguistic
endeavor, an uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and
its duration. This uncertainty is associated with the task of synchronizing the
spike trains of different duration representing different words. The
uncertainty involves peculiar quantum features, so that word comparison amounts
to measurement-based-quantum computation. Such a quantum behavior explains the
onset and decay of the memory window connecting successive pieces of a
linguistic text. The behavior here discussed is applicable to other reported
evidences of quantum effects in human linguistic processes, so far lacking a
plausible framework, since either no efforts to assign an appropriate quantum
constant had been associated or speculating on microscopic processes dependent
on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic decoherence times.
