Simulation of Large Scale Neural Networks for Evaluation Applications
Understanding the complexity of biological neural networks like the human
brain is one of the scientific challenges of our century. The organization of
the brain can be described at different levels, ranging from small neural
networks to entire brain regions. Existing methods for the description of
functionally or effective connectivity are based on the analysis of relations
between the activities of different neural units by detecting correlations or
information flow. This is a crucial step in understanding neural disorders like
Alzheimers disease and their causative factors. To evaluate these estimation
methods, it is necessary to refer to a neural network with known connectivity,
which is typically unknown for natural biological neural networks. Therefore,
network simulations, also in silico, are available. In this work, the in silico
simulation of large scale neural networks is established and the influence of
different topologies on the generated patterns of neuronal signals is
investigated. The goal is to develop standard evaluation methods for
neurocomputational algorithms with a realistic large scale model to enable
benchmarking and comparability of different studies.
