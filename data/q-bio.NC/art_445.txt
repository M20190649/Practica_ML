Optimizing working memory with heterogeneity of recurrent cortical
  excitation
A neural correlate of parametric working memory is a stimulus specific rise
in neuron firing rate that persists long after the stimulus is removed. Network
models with local excitation and broad inhibition support persistent neural
activity, linking network architecture and parametric working memory. Cortical
neurons receive noisy input fluctuations which causes persistent activity to
diffusively wander about the network, degrading memory over time. We explore
how cortical architecture that supports parametric working memory affects the
diffusion of persistent neural activity. Studying both a spiking network and a
simplified potential well model, we show that spatially heterogeneous
excitatory coupling stabilizes a discrete number of persistent states, reducing
the diffusion of persistent activity over the network. However, heterogeneous
coupling also coarse-grains the stimulus representation space, limiting the
capacity of parametric working memory. The storage errors due to
coarse-graining and diffusion tradeoff so that information transfer between the
initial and recalled stimulus is optimized at a fixed network heterogeneity.
For sufficiently long delay times, the optimal number of attractors is less
than the number of possible stimuli, suggesting that memory networks can
under-represent stimulus space to optimize performance. Our results clearly
demonstrate the effects of network architecture and stochastic fluctuations on
parametric memory storage.
