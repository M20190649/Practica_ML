Fractal-based Correlation Analysis for Resting State Functional
  Connectivity of the Rat Brain in Functional MRI
The most studies on functional connectivity have been done by analyzing the
brain's hemodynamic response to a stimulation. On the other hand, the
low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent
(BOLD) signals of functional MRI have been observed in the resting state.
However, the BOLD signals in resting state are significantly corrupted by huge
noises arising from cardiac pulsation, respiration, subject motion, scanner,
and so forth. Especially, the noise compounds are stronger in the rat brain
than in the human brain. To overcome such an artifact, we assumed that fractal
behavior in BOLD signals reflects low frequency neural activity, and applied
the theorem such that the wavelet correlation spectrum between long memory
processes is scale-invariant over low frequency scales. Here, we report an
experiment that shows special correlation patterns not only in correlation of
scaling coefficients in very low-frequency band (less than 0.0078Hz) but also
in asymptotic wavelet correlation. In addition, we show the distribution of the
Hurst exponents in the rat brain.
