Spatiotemporal Dissociation of Brain Activity underlying Subjective
  Awareness, Objective Performance and Confidence
Despite intense recent research, the neural correlates of conscious visual
perception remain elusive. The most established paradigm for studying brain
mechanisms underlying conscious perception is to keep the physical sensory
inputs constant and identify brain activities that correlate with the changing
content of conscious awareness. However, such a contrast based on conscious
content alone would not only reveal brain activities directly contributing to
conscious perception, but also include brain activities that precede or follow
it. To address this issue, we devised a paradigm whereby we collected,
trial-by-trial, measures of objective performance, subjective awareness, and
the confidence level of subjective awareness. Using magnetoencephalography
recordings in healthy human volunteers, we dissociated brain activities
underlying these different cognitive phenomena. Our results provide strong
evidence that widely distributed slow cortical potentials (SCPs) correlate with
subjective awareness, even after the effects of objective performance and
confidence were both removed. The SCP correlate of conscious perception
manifests strongly in its waveform, phase, and power. In contrast, objective
performance and confidence were both contributed by relatively transient brain
activity. These results shed new light on the brain mechanisms of conscious,
unconscious, and metacognitive processing.
