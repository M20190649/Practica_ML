Reducing a cortical network to a Potts model yields storage capacity
  estimates
An autoassociative network of Potts units, coupled via tensor connections,
has been proposed and analysed as an effective model of an extensive cortical
network with distinct short- and long-range synaptic connections, but it has
not been clarified in what sense it can be regarded as an effective model. We
draw here the correspondence between the two, which indicates the need to
introduce a local feedback term in the reduced model, i.e., in the Potts
network. An effective model allows the study of phase transitions. As an
example, we study the storage capacity of the Potts network with this
additional term, the local feedback $w$, which contributes to drive the
activity of the network towards one of the stored patterns. The storage
capacity calculation, performed using replica tools, is limited to fully
connected networks, for which a Hamiltonian can be defined. To extend the
results to the case of intermediate partial connectivity, we also derive the
self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis for the Potts network; and finally we
discuss implications for semantic memory in humans.
