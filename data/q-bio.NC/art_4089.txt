Limits and dynamics of stochastic neuronal networks with random
  heterogeneous delays
Realistic networks display heterogeneous transmission delays. We analyze here
the limits of large stochastic multi-populations networks with stochastic
coupling and random interconnection delays. We show that depending on the
nature of the delays distributions, a quenched or averaged propagation of chaos
takes place in these networks, and that the network equations converge towards
a delayed McKean-Vlasov equation with distributed delays. Our approach is
mostly fitted to neuroscience applications. We instantiate in particular a
classical neuronal model, the Wilson and Cowan system, and show that the
obtained limit equations have Gaussian solutions whose mean and standard
deviation satisfy a closed set of coupled delay differential equations in which
the distribution of delays and the noise levels appear as parameters. This
allows to uncover precisely the effects of noise, delays and coupling on the
dynamics of such heterogeneous networks, in particular their role in the
emergence of synchronized oscillations. We show in several examples that not
only the averaged delay, but also the dispersion, govern the dynamics of such
networks.
