Topographic maps in the brain are fundamental to processing of causality
The ubiquity of topographic maps in the brain has long been known, and
molecular mechanisms for the formation of topographic organization of neural
systems have been revealed. Less attention has been given to the question of
why are the maps topographical and why so ubiquitous. In this study, I explore
the implications of the topographic maps for brain function, by employing the
mathematical framework of the Zeeman topology. I propose the notion about the
meaning of topographic order as generic mechanisms for the representation and
analysis of causal structure, implemented by the neural systems. This leads to
a much improved understanding of the division of labour between chemical
systems and neural systems in the formation of maps to deal with causality.
