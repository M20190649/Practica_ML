Subjective physics
Imagine a naive organism who does not know anything about the world. It can
capture signals through its sensors and it can make actions. What kind of
knowledge about the world is accessible to the organism? This situation is
analog to that of a physicist trying to understand the world through
observations and experiments. In the same way as physics describes the laws of
the world obtained in this way by the scientist, I propose to name subjective
physics the description of the laws that govern sensory signals and their
relationships with actions, as observed from the perspective of the perceptual
system of the organism. In this text, I present the main concepts of subjective
physics, illustrated with concrete examples.
