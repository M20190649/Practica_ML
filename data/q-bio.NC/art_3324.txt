A Community-Developed Open-Source Computational Ecosystem for Big Neuro
  Data
Big imaging data is becoming more prominent in brain sciences across
spatiotemporal scales and phylogenies. We have developed a computational
ecosystem that enables storage, visualization, and analysis of these data in
the cloud, thusfar spanning 20+ publications and 100+ terabytes including
nanoscale ultrastructure, microscale synaptogenetic diversity, and mesoscale
whole brain connectivity, making NeuroData the largest and most diverse open
repository of brain data.
