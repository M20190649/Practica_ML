Modulation of beta oscillations during movement initiation: modeling the
  ionic basis of a functional switch
We use a computational model to propose a physiological mechanism by which
transient control of beta oscillations in the indirect pathway of the basal
ganglia is orchestrated at the cellular level. Our model includes a simple and
robust mechanism by which a cellular switch (from bursting to tonic) almost
instantaneously translates into a functional gating switch (from blocking to
conducive) in an excitatory-inhibitory network. Applied to the control of beta
oscillations in the basal ganglia, the model shows the modulation of beta
activity under the action of a transient depolarization, for instance a
dopamine signal. The model predicts, by analogy to the thalamocortical circuit,
a novel gating function by which the transfer of cortical spikes through the
indirect pathway is blocked under the inhibitory drive preceding movement but
briefly released at the onset of movement execution.
