From sample to knowledge: Towards an integrated approach for
  neuroscience discovery
Imaging methods used in modern neuroscience experiments are quickly producing
large amounts of data capable of providing increasing amounts of knowledge
about neuroanatomy and function. A great deal of information in these datasets
is relatively unexplored and untapped. One of the bottlenecks in knowledge
extraction is that often there is no feedback loop between the knowledge
produced (e.g., graph, density estimate, or other statistic) and the earlier
stages of the pipeline (e.g., acquisition). We thus advocate for the
development of sample-to-knowledge discovery pipelines that one can use to
optimize acquisition and processing steps with a particular end goal (i.e.,
piece of knowledge) in mind. We therefore propose that optimization takes place
not just within each processing stage but also between adjacent (and
non-adjacent) steps of the pipeline. Furthermore, we explore the existing
categories of knowledge representation and models to motivate the types of
experiments and analysis needed to achieve the ultimate goal. To illustrate
this approach, we provide an experimental paradigm to answer questions about
large-scale synaptic distributions through a multimodal approach combining
X-ray microtomography and electron microscopy.
