Modulation of synaptic plasticity by glutamatergic gliotransmission: A
  modeling study
Glutamatergic gliotransmission, that is the release of glutamate from
perisynaptic astrocyte processes in an activity-dependent manner, has emerged
as a potentially crucial signaling pathway for regulation of synaptic
plasticity, yet its modes of expression and function in vivo remain unclear.
Here, we focus on two experimentally well-identified gliotransmitter patwhays:
(i)~modulations of synaptic release and (ii)~postynaptic slow inward currents
mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, and investigate their possible
functional relevance on synaptic plasticity in a biophysical model of an
astrocyte-regulated synapse. Our model predicts that both pathways could
profoundly affect both short- and long-term plasticity. In particular,
activity-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, could dramatically change
spike-timing--dependent plasticity, turning potentiation into depression (and
vice versa) for the same protocol.
