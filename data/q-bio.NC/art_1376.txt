Reconstruction of brain networks involved in magnetophosphene perception
  using dense electroencephalography
Characterizing functional brain networks in humans during magnetophosphene
perception. Dense electroencephalography (EEG, 128 channels) was performed in
N=3 volunteers during high-level (50 mT) magnetic field (MF) exposure.
Functional brain networks were reconstructed, at the cortical level from scalp
recordings, using the EEG source connectivity method. Magnetophosphene
perception appears to consistently activate the right inferior
occipito-temporal pathway. This study provides the very first neuroimaging
results characterizing magnetophosphene perception in humans. The use of
dense-EEG source connectivity is a promising approach in the field of
bioelectromagnetics.
