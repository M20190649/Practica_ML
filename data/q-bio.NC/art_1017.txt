Increasing cognitive-emotional flexibility with meditation and hypnosis:
  The cognitive neuroscience of de-automatization
Meditation and hypnosis both aim to facilitate cognitive-emotional
flexibility, i.e., the "de-automatization" of thought and behavior. However,
little research or theory has addressed how internal thought patterns might
change after such interventions, even though alterations in the internal flow
of consciousness may precede externally observable changes in behavior. This
chapter outlines three mechanisms by which meditation or hypnosis might alter
or reduce automatic associations and elaborations of spontaneous thought: by an
overall reduction of the chaining of thoughts into an associative stream; by
de-automatizing and diversifying the content of thought chains (i.e.,
increasing thought flexibility or variety); and, finally, by re-automatizing
chains of thought along desired or valued paths (i.e., forming new, voluntarily
chosen mental habits). The authors discuss behavioral and cognitive
neuroscientific evidence demonstrating the influence of hypnosis and meditation
on internal cognition and highlight the putative neurobiological basis, as well
as potential benefits, of these forms of de-automatization.
