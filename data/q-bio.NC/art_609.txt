Homomorphisms of connectome graphs
We propose to study homomorphisms of connectome graphs. Homomorphisms can be
studied as sequences of elementary homomorphisms - folds, which identify pairs
of vertices. Several fold types are defined. Initial computation results for
some connectome graphs are described.
