Revisiting chaos in stimulus-driven spiking networks: signal encoding
  and discrimination
Highly connected recurrent neural networks often produce chaotic dynamics,
meaning their precise activity is sensitive to small perturbations. What are
the consequences for how such networks encode streams of temporal stimuli? On
the one hand, chaos is a strong source of randomness, suggesting that small
changes in stimuli will be obscured by intrinsically generated variability. On
the other hand, recent work shows that the type of chaos that occurs in spiking
networks can have a surprisingly low-dimensional structure, suggesting that
there may be "room" for fine stimulus features to be precisely resolved. Here
we show that strongly chaotic networks produce patterned spikes that reliably
encode time-dependent stimuli: using a decoder sensitive to spike times on
timescales of 10's of ms, one can easily distinguish responses to very similar
inputs. Moreover, recurrence serves to distribute signals throughout chaotic
networks so that small groups of cells can encode substantial information about
signals arriving elsewhere. A conclusion is that the presence of strong chaos
in recurrent networks does not prohibit precise stimulus encoding.
