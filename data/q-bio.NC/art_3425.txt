Multi-channel EEG recordings during a sustained-attention driving task
We described driver behaviour and brain dynamics acquired from a 90-minute
sustained-attention task in an immersive driving simulator. The data include 62
copies of 32 channel electroencephalography (EEG) data for 27 subjects that
drove on a four lane highway and were asked to keep the car cruising in the
centre of the lane. Lane departure events were randomly induced to make the car
drift from the original cruising lane towards the left or right lane. A
complete trial includes events with deviation onset, response onset, and
response offset. The next trial, in which the subject has to drive back to the
original cruising lane, occurs from 5 to 10 seconds after finishing the current
trial. We hope that this dataset will lead to the development of novel neural
processing assays that can be used to index brain cortical dynamics and detect
driving fatigue and drowsiness. This publicly available dataset is beneficial
to the neuroscientific and brain computer interface communities.
