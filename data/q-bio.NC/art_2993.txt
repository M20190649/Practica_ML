Stochastic Ising model with plastic interactions
We propose a new model based on the Ising model with the aim to study
synaptic plasticity phenomena in neural networks. It is today well established
in biology that the synapses or connections between certain types of neurons
are strengthened when the neurons are co-active, a form of the so called
synaptic plasticity. Such mechanism is believed to mediate the formation and
maintenance of memories. The proposed model describes some features from that
phenomenon. Together with the spin-flip dynamics, in our model the coupling
constants are also subject to stochastic dynamics, so that they interact with
each other. The evolution of the system is described by a continuous-time
Markov jump process.
