A hidden Markov model for decoding and the analysis of replay in spike
  trains
We present a hidden Markov model that describes variation in an animal's
position associated with varying levels of activity in action potential spike
trains of individual place cell neurons. The model incorporates a
coarse-graining of position, which we find to be a more parsimonious
description of the system than other models. We use a sequential Monte Carlo
algorithm for Bayesian inference of model parameters, including the state space
dimension, and we explain how to estimate position from spike train
observations (decoding). We obtain greater accuracy over other methods in the
conditions of high temporal resolution and small neuronal sample size. We also
present a novel, model-based approach to the study of replay: the expression of
spike train activity related to behaviour during times of motionlessness or
sleep, thought to be integral to the consolidation of long-term memories. We
demonstrate how we can detect the time, information content and compression
rate of replay events in simulated and real hippocampal data recorded from rats
in two different environments, and verify the correlation between the times of
detected replay events and of sharp wave/ripples in the local field potential.
