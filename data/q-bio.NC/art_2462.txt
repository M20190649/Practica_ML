How to enhance the dynamic range of excitatory-inhibitory excitable
  networks
We investigate the collective dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory excitable
networks in response to external stimuli. How to enhance dynamic range, which
represents the ability of networks to encode external stimuli, is crucial to
many applications. We regard the system as a two-layer network (E-Layer and
I-Layer) and explore the criticality and dynamic range on diverse networks.
Interestingly, we find that phase transition occurs when the dominant
eigenvalue of E-layer's weighted adjacency matrix is exactly one, which is only
determined by the topology of E-Layer. Meanwhile, it is shown that dynamic
range is maximized at critical state. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose
an inhibitory factor for each excitatory node. We suggest that if nodes with
high inhibitory factors are cut out from I-Layer, dynamic range could be
further enhanced. However, because of the sparseness of networks and passive
function of inhibitory nodes, the improvement is relatively small compared
tooriginal dynamic range. Even so, this provides a strategy to enhance dynamic
range.
