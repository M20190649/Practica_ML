Single-Neuron Criticality Optimizes Analog Dendritic Computation
Neurons are thought of as the building blocks of excitable brain tissue.
However, at the single neuron level, the neuronal membrane, the dendritic arbor
and the axonal projections can also be considered an extended active medium.
Active dendritic branchlets enable the propagation of dendritic spikes, whose
computational functions, despite several proposals, remain an open question.
Here we propose a concrete function to the active channels in large dendritic
trees. By using a probabilistic cellular automaton approach, we model the
input-output response of large active dendritic arbors subjected to complex
spatio-temporal inputs and exhibiting non-stereotyped dendritic spikes. We find
that, if dendritic spikes have a non-deterministic duration, the dendritic
arbor can undergo a continuous phase transition from a quiescent to an active
state, thereby exhibiting spontaneous and self-sustained localized activity as
suggested by experiments. Analogously to the critical brain hypothesis, which
states that neuronal networks self-organize near a phase transition to take
advantage of specific properties of the critical state, here we propose that
neurons with large dendritic arbors optimize their capacity to distinguish
incoming stimuli at the critical state. We suggest that "computation at the
edge of a phase transition" is more compatible with the view that dendritic
arbors perform an analog rather than a digital dendritic computation.
