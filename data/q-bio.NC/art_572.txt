Neural Population Coding of Multiple Stimuli
In natural scenes, objects generally appear together with other objects. Yet,
theoretical studies of neural population coding typically focus on the encoding
of single objects in isolation. Experimental studies suggest that neural
responses to multiple objects are well described by linear or nonlinear
combinations of the responses to constituent objects, a phenomenon we call
stimulus mixing. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the consequences of
common forms of stimulus mixing observed in cortical responses. We show that
some of these mixing rules can severely compromise the brain's ability to
decode the individual objects. This cost is usually greater than the cost
incurred by even large reductions in the gain or large increases in neural
variability, explaining why the benefits of attention can be understood
primarily in terms of a stimulus selection, or demixing, mechanism rather than
purely as a gain increase or noise reduction mechanism. The cost of stimulus
mixing becomes even higher when the number of encoded objects increases,
suggesting a novel mechanism that might contribute to set size effects observed
in myriad psychophysical tasks. We further show that a specific form of neural
correlation and heterogeneity in stimulus mixing among the neurons can
partially alleviate the harmful effects of stimulus mixing. Finally, we derive
simple conditions that must be satisfied for unharmful mixing of stimuli.
