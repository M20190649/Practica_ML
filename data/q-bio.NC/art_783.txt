The balancing effect in brain-machine interaction
The meta analysis of Intangible Brain Machine Interaction (IMMI) data with
random number generators is re-evaluated through the application of rigorous
and recognized mathematical tools. The current analysis shows that the
statistical average of the true RNG-IMMI data is not shifted from chance by
direct mental intervention, thus refuting the IMMI hypothesis. A facet of this
general statistical behavior of true RNG-IMMI data is the statistical balancing
of scores observed in IMMI tests where binary testing conditions are adopted.
The actual dynamics that had been supporting the elusive IMMI effect are shown
to be related to the psychology of experimenters. The implications of the
refutation of the IMMI hypothesis especially on associated phenomena are also
discussed.
