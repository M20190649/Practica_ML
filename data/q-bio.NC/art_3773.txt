Robustness and Enhancement of Neural Synchronization by
  Activity-Dependent Coupling
We study the synchronization of two model neurons coupled through a synapse
having an activity-dependent strength. Our synapse follows the rules of
Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We show that this plasticity of the
coupling between neurons produces enlarged frequency locking zones and results
in synchronization that is more rapid and much more robust against noise than
classical synchronization arising from connections with constant strength. We
also present a simple discrete map model that demonstrates the generality of
the phenomenon.
