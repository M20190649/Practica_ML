Gait recognition via deep learning of the center-of-pressure trajectory
Analyzing the force that a walking individual applies to the ground has been
proposed for identification purpose. Using end-to-end learning, I investigated
whether the center-of-pressure trajectory is sufficiently unique to identify a
person with a high certainty. Thirty-six adults walked on a treadmill equipped
with a force platform that recorded the positions of the center of pressure.
The raw two-dimensional signals were sliced into segments of two gait cycles. A
set of 20,250 segments from 30 subjects was used to configure and train
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best CNN classified a separated set
containing 2,250 segments with 99.9% overall accuracy. A second set of 4,500
segments from the six remaining subjects was then used for transfer learning.
Several small subsamples of this set were selected randomly and used for fine
tuning. Training with two segments per subject was sufficient to achieve 100%
accuracy. The results suggest that every person produces a unique trajectory of
underfoot pressures and that CNNs can learn the distinctive features of these
trajectories. Using transfer learning, a few strides could be sufficient to
learn and identify new gaits.
