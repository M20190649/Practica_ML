Error correction and fast detectors implemented by ultra-fast neuronal
  plasticity
We experimentally show that the neuron functions as a precise
time-integrator, where the accumulated changes in neuronal response latencies,
under complex and random stimulation patterns, are solely a function of a
global quantity, the average time-lag between stimulations. In contrast,
momentary leaps in the neuronal response latency follow trends of consecutive
stimulations, indicating ultra-fast neuronal plasticity. On a circuit level,
this ultra-fast neuronal plasticity phenomenon implements error-correction
mechanisms and fast detectors for misplaced stimulations. Additionally, at
moderate/high stimulation rates this phenomenon destabilizes/stabilizes a
periodic neuronal activity disrupted by misplaced stimulations.
