Formation and life-time of memory domains in the dissipative quantum
  model of brain
We show that in the dissipative quantum model of brain the time-dependence of
the frequencies of the electrical dipole wave quanta leads to the dynamical
organization of the memories in space (i.e. to their localization in more or
less diffused regions of the brain) and in time (i.e. to their longer or
shorter life-time). The life-time and the localization in domains of the memory
states also depend on internal parameters and on the number of links that the
brain establishes with the external world. These results agree with the
physiological observations of the dynamic formation of neural circuitry which
grows as brain develops and relates to external world.
