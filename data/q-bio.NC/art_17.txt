Graded persisting activity of heterogeneous neuron ensembles subject to
  white noises
Effects of distractions such as noises and parameter heterogeneity have been
studied on the firing activity of ensemble neurons, each of which is described
by the extended Morris-Lecar model showing the graded persisting firings with
the aid of an included ${\rm Ca}^{2+}$-dependent cation current. Although the
sustained activity of {\it single} neurons is rather robust in a sense that the
activity is realized even in the presence of the distractions, the graded
frequency of sustained firings is vulnerable to them. It has been shown,
however, that the graded persisting activity of {\it ensemble} neurons becomes
much robust to the distractions by the pooling (ensemble) effect. When the
coupling is introduced, the synchronization of firings in ensemble neurons is
enhanced, which is beneficial to firings of target neurons.
