An artificial neural network to find correlation patterns in an
  arbitrary number of variables
Methods to find correlation among variables are of interest to many
disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, (big) data mining and
neurosciences. Parameters that measure correlation between two variables are of
limited utility when used with multiple variables. In this work, I propose a
simple criterion to measure correlation among an arbitrary number of variables,
based on a data set. The central idea is to i) design a function of the
variables that can take different forms depending on a set of parameters, ii)
calculate the difference between a statistics associated to the function
computed on the data set and the same statistics computed on a randomised
version of the data set, called "scrambled" data set, and iii) optimise the
parameters to maximise this difference. Many such functions can be organised in
layers, which can in turn be stacked one on top of the other, forming a neural
network. The function parameters are searched with an enhanced genetic
algortihm called POET and the resulting method is tested on a cancer gene data
set. The method may have potential implications for some issues that affect the
field of neural networks, such as overfitting, the need to process huge amounts
of data for training and the presence of "adversarial examples".
