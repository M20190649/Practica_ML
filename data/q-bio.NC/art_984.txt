Topological mapping of space in bat hippocampus
Mammalian hippocampus plays a key role in spatial learning and memory, but
the exact nature of the hippocampal representation of space is still being
explored. Recently, there has been a fair amount of success in modeling
hippocampal spatial maps in rats, assuming a topological perspective on spatial
information processing. In this paper, we use the topological model to study
$3D$ learning in bats, which produces several insights into neurophysiological
mechanisms of the hippocampal spatial mapping. First, we demonstrate functional
importance of the cell assemblies for producing accurate maps of the $3D$
environments. Second, the model suggests that the readout neurons in these cell
assemblies should function as integrators of synaptic inputs, rather than
detectors of place cells' coactivity and allows estimating the integration time
window. Lastly, the model suggests that, in contrast with relatively slow
moving rats, suppressing $\theta$-precession in bats improves the place cells
capacity to encode spatial maps, which is consistent with the experimental
observations.
