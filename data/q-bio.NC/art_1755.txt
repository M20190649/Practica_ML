Hebbian imprinting and retrieval in oscillatory neural networks
We introduce a model of generalized Hebbian learning and retrieval in
oscillatory neural networks modeling cortical areas such as hippocampus and
olfactory cortex. Recent experiments have shown that synaptic plasticity
depends on spike timing, especially on synapses from excitatory pyramidal
cells, in hippocampus and in sensory and cerebellar cortex. Here we study how
such plasticity can be used to form memories and input representations when the
neural dynamics are oscillatory, as is common in the brain (particularly in the
hippocampus and olfactory cortex). Learning is assumed to occur in a phase of
neural plasticity, in which the network is clamped to external teaching
signals. By suitable manipulation of the nonlinearity of the neurons or of the
oscillation frequencies during learning, the model can be made, in a retrieval
phase, either to categorize new inputs or to map them, in a continuous fashion,
onto the space spanned by the imprinted patterns. We identify the first of
these possibilities with the function of olfactory cortex and the second with
the observed response characteristics of place cells in hippocampus. We
investigate both kinds of networks analytically and by computer simulations,
and we link the models with experimental findings, exploring, in particular,
how the spike timing dependence of the synaptic plasticity constrains the
computational function of the network and vice versa.
