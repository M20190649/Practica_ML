A complete mean-field theory for dynamics of binary recurrent neural
  networks
We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of
recurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.
Using the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete
description of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and
finite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems
for which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,
we uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units
with statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous
behavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the
thermodynamical limit.
