Subdominant Dense Clusters Allow for Simple Learning and High
  Computational Performance in Neural Networks with Discrete Synapses
We show that discrete synaptic weights can be efficiently used for learning
in large scale neural systems, and lead to unanticipated computational
performance. We focus on the representative case of learning random patterns
with binary synapses in single layer networks. The standard statistical
analysis shows that this problem is exponentially dominated by isolated
solutions that are extremely hard to find algorithmically. Here, we introduce a
novel method that allows us to find analytical evidence for the existence of
subdominant and extremely dense regions of solutions. Numerical experiments
confirm these findings. We also show that the dense regions are surprisingly
accessible by simple learning protocols, and that these synaptic configurations
are robust to perturbations and generalize better than typical solutions. These
outcomes extend to synapses with multiple states and to deeper neural
architectures. The large deviation measure also suggests how to design novel
algorithmic schemes for optimization based on local entropy maximization.
