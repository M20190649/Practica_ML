Should you believe that this coin is fair?
Faced with a sequence of N binary events, such as coin flips (or Ising
spins), it is natural to ask whether these events reflect some underlying
dynamic signals or are just random. Plausible models for the dynamics of hidden
biases lead to surprisingly high probabilities of misidentifying random
sequences as biased. In particular, this probability decays as N^(-1/4), so
that no reasonable amount of data would be sufficient to induce the concept of
a fair coin with high probability. I suggest that these theoretical results may
be relevant to understanding experiments on the apparent misperception of
random sequences by human observers.
