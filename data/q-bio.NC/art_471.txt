Revisiting the two-mass model of the vocal folds
Realistic mathematical modeling of voice production has been recently boosted
by applications to different fields like bioprosthetics, quality speech
synthesis and pathological diagnosis. In this work, we revisit a two-mass model
of the vocal folds that includes accurate fluid mechanics for the air passage
through the folds and nonlinear properties of the tissue. We present the
bifurcation diagram for such a system, focusing on the dynamical properties of
two regimes of interest: the onset of oscillations and the normal phonation
regime. We also show theoretical support to the nonlinear nature of the elastic
properties of the folds tissue by comparing theoretical isofrequency curves
with reported experimental data.
