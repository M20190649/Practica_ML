Spectra and waiting-time densities in firing resonant and nonresonant
  neurons
The response of a neural cell to an external stimulus can follow one of the
two patterns: Nonresonant neurons monotonously relax to the resting state after
excitation while resonant ones show subthreshold oscillations. We investigate
how do these subthreshold properties of neurons affect their suprathreshold
response. Vice versa we ask: Can we distinguish between both types of neuronal
dynamics using suprathreshold spike trains? The dynamics of neurons is given by
stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo and Morris-Lecar models with either having a focus
or a node as the stable fixpoint. We determine numerically the spectral power
density as well as the interspike interval density in response to a random
(noise-like) signals. We show that the information about the type of dynamics
obtained from power spectra is of limited validity. In contrast, the interspike
interval density gives a very sensitive instrument for the diagnostics of
whether the dynamics has resonant or nonresonant properties. For the latter
value we formulate a fit formula and use it to reconstruct theoretically the
spectral power density, which coincides with the numerically obtained spectra.
We underline that the renewal theory is applicable to analysis of
suprathreshold responses even of resonant neurons.
