Provoking Predetermined Aperiodic Patterns in Human Brainwaves
In the present work, electroencephalographic recordings of healthy human
participants were performed to study the entrainment of brainwaves using a
variety of stimulus. First, periodic entrainment of the brainwaves was studied
using two different stimuli in the form of periodic auditory and visual
signals. The entrainment with the periodic visual stimulation was consistently
observed, whereas the auditory entrainment was inconclusive. Hence, a photic
(Visual) stimulus, where two frequencies were presented to the subject
simultaneously was used to further explore the bifrequency entrainment of human
brainwaves. Subsequently, the evolution of brainwaves as a result of an
aperiodic stimulation was explored, wherein an entrainment to the predetermined
aperiodic pattern was observed. These results suggest that aperiodic
entrainment could be used as a tool for guided modification of brainwaves. This
could find possible applications in processes such as epilepsy suppression and
biofeedback.
