A stochastic system with infinite interacting components to model the
  time evolution of the membrane potentials of a population of neurons
We consider a new class of interacting particle systems with a countable
number of interacting components. The system represents the time evolution of
the membrane potentials of an infinite set of interacting neurons. We prove the
existence and uniqueness of the process, using a perfect simulation procedure.
We show that this algorithm is successful, that is, we show that the number of
steps of the algorithm is almost surely finite. We also construct a perfect
simulation procedure for the coupling of a process with a finite number of
neurons and the process with a infinite number of neurons. As a consequence, we
obtain an upper bound for the error that we make when sampling from a finite
set of neurons instead of the infinite set of neurons.
