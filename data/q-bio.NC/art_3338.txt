The first principle of neural circuit and the general
  Circuit-Probability theory
A new neural circuit is proposed by considering the myelin as an inductor.
This new neural circuit can explain why the lump-parameter circuit used in
previous C-P theory is valid. Meanwhile, it provides a new explanation of the
biological function of myelin for neural signal propagation. Furthermore, a new
model for magnetic nerve stimulation is built and all phenomena in magnetic
nerve stimulation can be well explained. Based on this model, the coil
structure can be optimized.
