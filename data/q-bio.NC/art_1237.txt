Computational Psychiatry in Borderline Personality Disorder
Purpose of review: We review the literature on the use and potential use of
computational psychiatry methods in Borderline Personality Disorder.
  Recent findings: Computational approaches have been used in psychiatry to
increase our understanding of the molecular, circuit, and behavioral basis of
mental illness. This is of particular interest in BPD, where the collection of
ecologically valid data, especially in interpersonal settings, is becoming more
common and more often subject to quantification. Methods that test learning and
memory in social contexts, collect data from real-world settings, and relate
behavior to molecular and circuit networks are yielding data of particular
interest.
  Summary: Research in BPD should focus on collaborative efforts to design and
interpret experiments with direct relevance to core BPD symptoms and potential
for translation to the clinic.
