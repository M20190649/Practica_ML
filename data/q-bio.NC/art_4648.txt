Community detection in weighted brain connectivity networks beyond the
  resolution limit
Graph theory provides a powerful framework to investigate brain functional
connectivity networks and their modular organization. However, most graph-based
methods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected
previous studies and prevented detection of modules, or communities, that are
smaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function
rooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied
to brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in
contrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to
binary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a
continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain
regions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of
Surprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate
this approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular
structure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection
methods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of
small modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such
as those observed in fMRI data. Finally, we apply our novel approach to
functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experimenta, and
demonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of
clusters spanning multiple scales.
