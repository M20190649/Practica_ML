Derivation of the Variational Bayes Equations
The derivation of key equations for the variational Bayes approach is
well-known in certain circles. However, translating the fundamental derivations
(e.g., as found in Beal (2003)) to the notation of Friston (2013, 2015) is
somewhat delicate. Further, the notion of using variational Bayes in the
context of a system with Markov blankets requires special attention. This
Technical Report presents the derivation in detail. It further illustrates how
the variational Bayes method provides a framework for a new computational
engine, incorporating the 2-D cluster variation method (CVM), which provides a
necessary free energy equation that can be minimized across both the external
and representational systems' states, respectively.
