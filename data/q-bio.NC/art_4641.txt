Identification of Bifurcations from Observations of Noisy Biological
  Oscillators
Hair bundles are biological oscillators that actively transduce mechanical
stimuli into electrical signals in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral-line
systems of vertebrates. A bundle's function can be explained in part by its
operation near a particular type of bifurcation, a qualitative change in
behavior. By operating near different varieties of bifurcation, the bundle
responds best to disparate classes of stimuli. We show how to determine the
identity of and proximity to distinct bifurcations despite the presence of
substantial environmental noise.
