Ocular dominance patterns and the wire length minimization: a numerical
  study
We study a mathematical model for ocular dominance patterns (ODPs) in primary
visual cortex. This model is based on the premise that ODP is an adaptation to
minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we attempt to understand the
existing ODPs by solving a wire length minimization problem. We divide all the
neurons into two classes: left- and right-eye dominated. We find that
segregation of neurons into monocular regions reduces wire length if the number
of connections to the neurons of the same class (intraocular) differs from the
number of interocular connections. The shape of the regions depends on the
relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. We find that if both classes
are almost equally represented, the optimal ODP consists of interdigitating
stripes. If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal ODP consists
of patches of the less abundant class surrounded by the neurons of the other
class. We predict that the transition from stripes to patches occurs when the
fraction of neurons dominated by the underrepresented eye is about 40%. This
prediction agrees with the data in macaque and Cebus monkeys. We also study the
dependence of the periodicity of ODP on the parameters of our model.
