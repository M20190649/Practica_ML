Human brain distinctiveness based on EEG spectral coherence connectivity
The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition,
has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of current analysis
rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain
regions, like power-spectrum estimates, thus neglecting possible temporal
dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important
physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions
are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses
spectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a
possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large
dataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting
state conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain
connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum
measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition
accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity
between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.41% is obtained in EC
(96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from centro-parietal
regions. Taken together, these results suggest that functional connectivity
patterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric
systems.
