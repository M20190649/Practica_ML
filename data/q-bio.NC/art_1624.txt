Systems of Oscillators Designed for a Specific Conscious Percept
As put forward by neuroscientists, the mechanisms of consciousness can be
elucidated by revealing correlations between neural dynamics and specific
conscious percepts. Recently, I have elaborated on the mathematical formulation
for a system of processes that are mutually connected to be isomorphic to a
conscious percept of a point in space. Importantly, in such a system, any
process can be derived through all other processes that form its complement, or
interpretation. To generate such a solution, I am proposing a dynamical system
of oscillators coupled in a manner to preserve the properties of a percept.
Specifically, I crafted a dynamical system that retains the mutual
relationships among processes, forming an operational map isomorphic to a
distance matrix that mimics a percept of space-like properties. The study and
results pave a novel way to analyze the dynamics of neural-like (oscillatory)
processes with a purpose of extracting the information relevant to specific
conscious percepts, which will facilitate the search for neural correlates of
consciousness.
