Comment on "Human Time-Frequency Acuity Beats the Fourier Uncertainty
  Principle"
In the initial article [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 044301 (2013), arXiv:1208.4611]
it was claimed that human hearing can beat the Fourier uncertainty principle.
In this Comment, we demonstrate that the experiment designed and implemented in
the original article was ill-chosen to test Fourier uncertainty in human
hearing.
