A Fokker-Planck approach to graded information propagation in
  pulse-gated feedforward neuronal networks
Information transmission is a key element for information processing in the
brain. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for transferring volleys of
spikes between layers of a feedforward neural circuit. Many of these mechanisms
use synchronous activity to provide windows in time when spikes may be
transferred more easily from layer to layer. Recently, we have demonstrated
that a pulse-gating mechanism can transfer graded information between layers in
a feedforward neuronal network. Our transfer mechanism resulted in a
time-translationally invariant firing rate and synaptic current waveforms of
arbitrary amplitude, thus providing exact, graded information transfer between
layers. In this paper, we apply a Fokker-Planck approach to understand how this
translational invariance manifests itself in a high-dimensional, non-linear
feedforward integrate-and-fire network. We show that there is good
correspondence in spiking probabilities between the Fokker-Planck solutions and
our previous mean-field solutions. We identify an approximate line attractor in
state space as the essential structure underlying the time-translational
invariance of our solutions. This approach has enabled us to better understand
the role played by the synaptic coupling, gating pulse and the membrane
potential probability density function in information transfer.
