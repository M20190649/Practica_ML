To do things with words (only): An introduction to the role of noise in
  coordination dynamics without equations
Uncertainty, spatial or temporal errors, variability, are classic themes in
the study of human and animal behaviors. Several theoretical approaches1 and
concepts have been adopted to tackle those issues, often considering the CNS as
an observer, using Shannon information and entropy, signal to noise ratio, and
recently a Bayesian approach, and free energy minimization. In the coordination
dynamics framework, addressing pattern formation processes underlying cognitive
functions, and goal directed human movement among others, the tools employed
originate from the statistical physics of Brownian motion and stochastic
processes. The relations between those theories/ concepts have been drawn for
some cases in their original fields, for example between free energy
minimization and diffusion model in a force field (Jordan et al., 1998). Here
an introductory presentation of the approach of noise in coordination dynamics
is proposed, aimed at the experimentalist.
