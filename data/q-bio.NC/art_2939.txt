Evoking complex neuronal networks by stimulating a single neuron
The dynamical responses of complex neuronal networks to external stimulus
injected on a \emph{single} neuron are investigated. Stimulating the
largest-degree neuron in the network, it is found that as the intensity of the
stimulus increases, the network will be transiting from the resting to firing
states and then restoring to the resting state, showing a bounded firing region
in the parameter space. Furthermore, it is found that as the coupling strength
decreases, the firing region is gradually expanded and, at the weak couplings,
separated into disconnected subregions. By a simplified network model, we
conduct a detail analysis on the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in
the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by stimulating intensity and
coupling strength, and, by introducing a new coefficient named effective
stimulus, explore the mechanisms of the modified firing region. It is revealed
that the coupling strength and stimulating intensity are equally important in
evoking the network, but with different mechanisms. Specifically, the effective
stimuli are \emph{shifted up} globally with the increase of the stimulating
intensity, while are \emph{drawn closer} with the increase of the coupling
strength. The dynamical responses of small-world and random complex networks to
external stimulus injected on the largest-degree neuron are also investigated,
which confirm the generality of the observed phenomena.
