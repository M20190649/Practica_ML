Model of the early development of thalamo-cortical connections and area
  patterning via signaling molecules
The mammalian cortex is divided into architectonic and functionally distinct
areas. There is growing experimental evidence that their emergence and
development is controlled by both epigenetic and genetic factors. The latter
were recently implicated as dominating the early cortical area specification.
In this paper, we present a theoretical model that explicitly considers the
genetic factors and that is able to explain several sets of experiments on
cortical area regulation involving transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6, and
fibroblast growth factor FGF8. The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-
cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated
genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can
make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early
development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be
further refined as more experimental facts become known.
