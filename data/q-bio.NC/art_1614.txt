Artificial computation of human brain disorders mainly based on ocular
  responses
Here we summarize abundant excuses that support the eye detection can be as a
noninvasive approach to early diagnose some brain disorders, including
Alzheimer disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ) and
major depressive disorder (MDD). Real-time ocular responses in everyone are
tightly associated with emotional state and cognitive processing in the brain.
At the eyeball areas, at least changes involved saccades, pupil response,
blinking, microvascular network morphology and thickness of retinal nerve fiber
layer (RNFL) are potentially to be candidates of biomarker to screen and
evaluate brain disorders. These days medical big data will be more accessible
especially with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze
precisely. Computer vision combined with machine-learning based AI particularly
deep-learning neural networks sheds a new light on cognitive neuroscience, and
many patients with psychotic disorders will primarily benefit from this
interdisciplinary advance to induce self-evaluation and real-time intervention
on brain disorders. Finally, we call for more AI applications going to approach
brain disorder issues, meanwhile, AI technology used in brain healthcare should
be working together with biological intelligence as we are running an AI
manifestation for major depression.
