Presynaptic calcium dynamics of learning neurons
We present a new model for the dynamics of the presynaptic intracellular
calcium concentration in neurons evoked by various stimulation protocols. The
aim of the model is twofold: We want to discuss the calcium transients during
and after specific stimulation protocols as they are used to induce
long-term-depression and long-term-potentiation. In addition we would like to
provide a general tool which allows the comparison of different calcium
experiments. This may help to draw conclusions on a wider base in future.
