Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder Show Larger Preferred
  Social Distance in Live Dyadic Interactions
Personal space (PS) regulation is a key component of effective social
engagement. PS varies among individuals and is regulated by brain circuits
involving the amygdala and the frontoparietal network. Others have reported
that simulated PS intrusions suggest larger preferred interpersonal distance
(PID) and a central role of amygdala hyperactivity in PS regulation in
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). This study is the first report of live
interpersonal distance preferences and relation to specific symptoms in BPD. We
found a 2-fold larger PID in BPD than control (n=30, n=23). There were no
significant differences in PID in BPD subject by medication status or pre-study
diagnosis, and no significant correlations between PID and intensity of BPD,
mood, anxiety, impulsive, or psychotic symptoms. In summary, PID is larger in
BPD than control subjects. Unexpectedly, BPD subject PID did not differ in by
medication status and did not correlate with intensity of any of the symptom
types tested. We discuss these findings in context of severe attachment
disturbances in BPD and the relationship between metaphoric social distance in
the attachment framework. Future work is needed to identify neural circuits
underlying PS regulation in BPD, individual differences in attachment, and
relationship to symptom trajectory.
