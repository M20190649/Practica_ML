duneuro - A software toolbox for forward modeling in neuroscience
This paper describes duneuro, a software toolbox for forward modeling in
neuroscience. Its purpose is to provide extendible and easy-to-use interfaces
and enable a closer integration into existing analysis pipelines. It provides
implementations of fitted and unfitted finite element methods and makes use of
the Dune framework. The forward problems consist of the electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) forward problems. For the incorporation
into existing analysis pipelines, Python and Matlab interfaces are provided.
The practical use is demonstrated on a source analysis example of evoked
potentials.
