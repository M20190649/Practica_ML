A model of sensory neural responses in the presence of unknown
  modulatory inputs
Neural responses are highly variable, and some portion of this variability
arises from fluctuations in modulatory factors that alter their gain, such as
adaptation, attention, arousal, expected or actual reward, emotion, and local
metabolic resource availability. Regardless of their origin, fluctuations in
these signals can confound or bias the inferences that one derives from spiking
responses. Recent work demonstrates that for sensory neurons, these effects can
be captured by a modulated Poisson model, whose rate is the product of a
stimulus-driven response function and an unknown modulatory signal. Here, we
extend this model, by incorporating explicit modulatory elements that are known
(specifically, spike-history dependence, as in previous models), and by
constraining the remaining latent modulatory signals to be smooth in time. We
develop inference procedures for fitting the entire model, including
hyperparameters, via evidence optimization, and apply these to simulated data,
and to responses of ferret auditory midbrain and cortical neurons to complex
sounds. We show that integrating out the latent modulators yields better (or
more readily-interpretable) receptive field estimates than a standard Poisson
model. Conversely, integrating out the stimulus dependence yields estimates of
the slowly-varying latent modulators.
