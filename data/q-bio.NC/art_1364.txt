Network organization of coopetitive genetic influences on cortical
  morphologies
Brain can be represented as a network, where regions are the nodes and
relations between the regions are edges. Within a network, co-existence of
cooperative and competitive relationships between different nodes is called
coopetition. Inter-regional genetic influences on morphological phenotypes
(cortical thickness, surface area) of cortex display such coopetitive
relationships. Here, we have represented these genetic influences as a network
and shown that cooperative and competitive genetic influences on cortical
morphological phenotypes follow distinct organization principles. Utilizing the
theory of structural balance, we have shown that the pattern of collective
regulation of cortical morphological phenotypes by cooperative and competitive
genetic influences are overall bilaterally symmetric and such patterns of
collective genetic regulation are similar to the principal modes of population
variation of cortical morphological phenotypes. Finally, we have observed that
the maximally and minimally imbalanced regions corresponding to the collective
genetic regulation partially overlap with the cortical structural network hubs.
