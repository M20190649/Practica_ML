What can a mathematician do in neuroscience?
Mammalian brain is one of the most complex objects in the known universe, as
it governs every aspect of animal's and human behavior. It is fair to say that
we have a very limited knowledge of how the brain operates and functions.
Computational Neuroscience is a scientific discipline that attempts to
understand and describe the brain in terms of mathematical modeling. This
user-friendly review tries to introduce this relatively new field to
mathematicians and physicists by showing examples of recent trends. It also
discusses briefly future prospects for constructing an integrated theory of
brain function.
