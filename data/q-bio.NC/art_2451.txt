Channel noise induced stochastic facilitation in an auditory brainstem
  neuron model
Neuronal membrane potentials fluctuate stochastically due to conductance
changes caused by random transitions between the open and close states of ion
channels. Although it has previously been shown that channel noise can
nontrivially affect neuronal dynamics, it is unknown whether ion-channel noise
is strong enough to act as a noise source for hypothesised noise-enhanced
information processing in real neuronal systems, i.e. 'stochastic
facilitation.' Here, we demonstrate that biophysical models of channel noise
can give rise to two kinds of recently discovered stochastic facilitation
effects in a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model of auditory brainstem neurons. The
first, known as slope-based stochastic resonance (SBSR), enables phasic neurons
to emit action potentials that can encode the slope of inputs that vary slowly
relative to key time-constants in the model. The second, known as inverse
stochastic resonance (ISR), occurs in tonically firing neurons when small
levels of noise inhibit tonic firing and replace it with burst-like dynamics.
Consistent with previous work, we conclude that channel noise can provide
significant variability in firing dynamics, even for large numbers of channels.
Moreover, our results show that possible associated computational benefits may
occur due to channel noise in neurons of the auditory brainstem. This holds
whether the firing dynamics in the model are phasic (SBSR can occur due to
channel noise) or tonic (ISR can occur due to channel noise).
