A Quantitative Overview of Biophysical Forces Governing Neural Function
The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is the currently accepted formalism of neuronal
excitability. However, the HH model does not capture a number of biophysical
behaviors associated with action potentials or propagating nerve impulses.
Physical mechanisms underlying these processes, such as reversible heat
transfer and axonal swelling have been separately investigated and
compartmentally modeled to indicate the nervous system is not purely electrical
or biochemical. Rather, mechanical forces and principles of thermodynamics also
govern neuronal excitability and signaling. To advance our understanding of
neural function and dysfunction, compartmentalized analyses of electrical,
chemical, and mechanical processes need to revaluated and integrated into more
comprehensive theories. The present quantitative perspective is intended to
broaden the awareness of known biophysical phenomena, which are often
overlooked in neuroscience. By starting to consider the collective influence of
the biophysical forces influencing neural function, new paradigms can be
applied to the characterization and manipulation of nervous systems.
