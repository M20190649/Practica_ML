Synthetic reverberating activity patterns embedded in networks of
  cortical neurons
Synthetic reverberating activity patterns are experimentally generated by
stimulation of a subset of neurons embedded in a spontaneously active network
of cortical cells in-vitro. The neurons are artificially connected by means of
conditional stimulation matrix, forming a synthetic local circuit with a
predefined programmable connectivity and time-delays. Possible uses of this
experimental design are demonstrated, analyzing the sensitivity of these
deterministic activity patterns to transmission delays and to the nature of
ongoing network dynamics.
