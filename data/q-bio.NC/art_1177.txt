Autocatalytic networks in cognition and the origin of culture
It has been proposed that cultural evolution was made possible by a cognitive
transition brought about by onset of the capacity for self-triggered recall and
rehearsal. Here we develop a novel idea that models of collectively
autocatalytic networks, developed for understanding the origin and organization
of life, may also help explain the origin of the kind of cognitive structure
that makes cultural evolution possible. In our setting, mental representations
(for example, memories, concepts, ideas) play the role of 'molecules', and
'reactions' involve the evoking of one representation by another through
remindings, associations, and stimuli. In the 'episodic mind', representations
are so coarse-grained (encode too few properties) that such reactions are
catalyzed only by external stimuli. As cranial capacity increased,
representations became more fine-grained (encoded more features), allowing them
to act as catalysts, leading to streams of thought. At this point, the mind
could combine representations and adapt them to specific needs and situations,
and thereby contribute to cultural evolution. In this paper, we propose and
study a simple and explicit cognitive model that gives rise naturally to
autocatylatic networks, and thereby provides a possible mechanism for the
transition from a pre-cultural episodic mind to a mimetic mind.
