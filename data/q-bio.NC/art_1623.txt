What the odor is not: Estimation by elimination
The olfactory system uses responses of a small number of broadly sensitive
receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we propose a
method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea is that a
receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information than a
receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants. So a
response below threshold signals absence of all such odorants. As a result, it
is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the odor is. We
demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors, response
functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method of
elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
resembling the circuit architecture in piriform cortex, and propose
experimental tests.
