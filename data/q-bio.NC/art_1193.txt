Stochastic Spike Synchronization in A Small-World Neural Network with
  Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network consisting of subthreshold
neurons which exhibit noise-induced spikings. This neuronal network has
adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDP, stochastic spike
synchronization (SSS) between noise-induced spikings of subthreshold neurons
was found to occur in a range of intermediate noise intensities through
competition between the constructive and the destructive roles of noise. Here,
we investigate the effect of additive STDP on the SSS by varying the noise
intensity. Occurrence of a "Matthew" effect in synaptic plasticity is found due
to a positive feedback process. As a result, good synchronization gets better
via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad
synchronization gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Emergence of LTP and
LTD of synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via microscopic studies
based on the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IISRs
(instantaneous individual spike rates) as well as the distributions of time
delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times. Furthermore, the
effects of multiplicative STDP (which depends on the states) on the SSS are
also studied and discussed in comparison with the case of additive STDP.
