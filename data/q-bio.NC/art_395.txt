A general theory of intertemporal decision-making and the perception of
  time
Animals and humans make decisions based on their expected outcomes. Since
relevant outcomes are often delayed, perceiving delays and choosing between
earlier versus later rewards (intertemporal decision-making) is an essential
component of animal behavior. The myriad observations made in experiments
studying intertemporal decision-making and time perception have not yet been
rationalized within a single theory. Here we present a
theory-Training--Integrated Maximized Estimation of Reinforcement Rate
(TIMERR)--that explains a wide variety of behavioral observations made in
intertemporal decision-making and the perception of time. Our theory postulates
that animals make intertemporal choices to optimize expected reward rates over
a limited temporal window; this window includes a past integration interval
(over which experienced reward rate is estimated) and the expected delay to
future reward. Using this theory, we derive a mathematical expression for the
subjective representation of time. A unique contribution of our work is in
finding that the past integration interval directly determines the steepness of
temporal discounting and the nonlinearity of time perception. In so doing, our
theory provides a single framework to understand both intertemporal
decision-making and time perception.
