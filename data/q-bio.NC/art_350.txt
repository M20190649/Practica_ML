Predicted selective increase of cortical magnification due to cortical
  folding
The cortical magnification matrix M is introduced founded on a notion similar
to that of the scalar cortical magnification factor M. Unlike M, this matrix is
suitable to describe anisotropy in cortical magnification, which is of
particular interest in the highly gyrified human cerebral cortex. The advantage
of our tensor method over other surface-based 3D methods to explore cortical
morphometry is that M expresses cortical quantities in the corresponding
sensory space. It allows us to investigate the spatial relation between sensory
function and anatomical structure. To this end, we consider the calcarine
sulcus (CS) as an anatomical landmark for the primary visual cortex (V1). We
found that a stereotypically formed 3D model of V1 compared to a flat model
explains an excess of cortical tissue for the representation of visual
information coming from the horizon of the visual field. This suggests that the
intrinsic geometry of this sulcus is adapted to encephalize a particular
function along the horizon. Since visual functions are assumed to be M-scaled,
cortical folding can serve as an anatomical basis for increased functionality
on the horizon similar to a retinal specialization known as visual streak,
which is found in animals with lower encephalization. Thus, the gain of surface
area by cortical folding links anatomical structure to cortical function in a
previously unrecognized way, which may guide sulci development.
