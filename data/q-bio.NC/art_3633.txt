TempoCave: Visualizing Dynamic Connectome Datasets to Support Cognitive
  Behavioral Therapy
We introduce TempoCave, a novel visualization application for analyzing
dynamic brain networks, or connectomes. TempoCave provides a range of
functionality to explore metrics related to the activity patterns and modular
affiliations of different regions in the brain. These patterns are calculated
by processing raw data retrieved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
scans, which creates a network of weighted edges between each brain region,
where the weight indicates how likely these regions are to activate
synchronously. In particular, we support the analysis needs of clinical
psychologists, who examine these modular affiliations and weighted edges and
their temporal dynamics, utilizing them to understand relationships between
neurological disorders and brain activity, which could have a significant
impact on the way in which patients are diagnosed and treated. We summarize the
core functionality of TempoCave, which supports a range of comparative tasks,
and runs both in a desktop mode and in an immersive mode. Furthermore, we
present a real-world use case that analyzes pre- and post-treatment connectome
datasets from 27 subjects in a clinical study investigating the use of
cognitive behavior therapy to treat major depression disorder, indicating that
TempoCave can provide new insight into the dynamic behavior of the human brain.
