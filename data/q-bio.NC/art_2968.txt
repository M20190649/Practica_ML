Fast-slow bursters in the unfolding of a high codimension singularity
  and the ultra-slow transitions of classes
Bursting is a phenomenon found in a variety of physical and biological
systems. For example, in neuroscience, bursting is believed to play a key role
in the way information is transferred in the nervous system. In this work, we
propose a model that, appropriately tuned, can display several types of
bursting behaviors. The model contains two subsystems acting at different
timescales. For the fast subsystem we use the planar unfolding of a high
codimension singularity. In its bifurcation diagram, we locate paths that
underly the right sequence of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow
subsystem steers the fast one back and forth along these paths leading to
bursting behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of
bursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystems. Transitions
between classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow modulation of the model's
parameters. A detailed exploration of the parameter space allows predicting
possible transitions. This provides a single framework to understand the
coexistence of diverse bursting patterns in physical and biological systems or
in models.
