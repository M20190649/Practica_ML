Interaction Mechanisms Quantified from Dynamical Features of Frog
  Choruses
Interaction mechanism in the acoustic communication of actual animals is
investigated by combining mathematical modeling and empirical data. Here we use
a deterministic mathematical model (a phase oscillator model) to describe the
interaction mechanism underlying the choruses of male Japanese tree frogs (Hyla
japonica) in which the male frogs attempt to avoid call overlaps with each
other due to acoustic communication. The mathematical model with a general
interaction term is identified by a Bayesian approach from multiple audio
recordings on the choruses of three male frogs. The identified model
qualitatively reproduces the stationary and dynamical features of the empirical
data, supporting the validity of the model identification. In addition, we
quantify the magnitude of attention paid among the male frogs from the
identified model, and then analyze the relationship between the attention and
behavioral parameters by using a statistical model. The analysis demonstrates
the biologically valid relationship about the negative correlation between the
attention and inter-frog distance, and also indicates the existence of a
behavioral strategy that the male frogs selectively pay attention towards a
less attractive male frog so as to utilize the advantage of their
attractiveness for effective mate attraction.
