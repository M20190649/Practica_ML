Forgetting in order to Remember Better
In human memory, forgetting occur rapidly after the remembering and the rate
of forgetting slowed down as time went. This is so-called the Ebbinghaus
forgetting curve. There are many explanations of how this curve occur based on
the properties of the brains. In this article, we use a simple mathematical
model to explain the mechanism of forgetting based on rearrangement inequality
and get a general formalism for short-term and long-term memory and use it to
fit the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. We also find out that forgetting is not a
flaw, instead it is help to improve the efficiency of remembering when human
confront different situations by reducing the interference of information and
reducing the number of retrievals. Furthurmove, we find that the interference
of informations limits the capacity of human memory, which is the "magic number
seven".
