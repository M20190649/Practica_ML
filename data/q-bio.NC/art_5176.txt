Spatiotemporal Information Processing with a Reservoir Decision-making
  Network
Spatiotemporal information processing is fundamental to brain functions. The
present study investigates a canonic neural network model for spatiotemporal
pattern recognition. Specifically, the model consists of two modules, a
reservoir subnetwork and a decision-making subnetwork. The former projects
complex spatiotemporal patterns into spatially separated neural
representations, and the latter reads out these neural representations via
integrating information over time; the two modules are combined together via
supervised-learning using known examples. We elucidate the working mechanism of
the model and demonstrate its feasibility for discriminating complex
spatiotemporal patterns. Our model reproduces the phenomenon of recognizing
looming patterns in the neural system, and can learn to discriminate gait with
very few training examples. We hope this study gives us insight into
understanding how spatiotemporal information is processed in the brain and
helps us to develop brain-inspired application algorithms.
