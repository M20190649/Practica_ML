High-Resolution Directed Human Connectomes and the Consensus Connectome
  Dynamics
Here we show a method of directing the edges of the connectomes, prepared
from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets from the human brain. Before the
present work, no high-definition directed braingraphs (or connectomes) were
published, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning
directions to the neural tracts discovered. Previous work on the functional
connectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical
causality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several
dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the "Consensus
Connectome Dynamics" (CCD), described earlier by our research group. In this
contribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015
vertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and
we also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site
\url{http://braingraph.org}. We also show the robustness of our edge directing
method in four independently chosen connectome datasets: we have found that
86\% of the edges, which were present in all four datasets, get the very same
directions in all datasets; therefore the direction method is robust, it does
not depend on the particular choice of the dataset. We think that our present
contribution opens up new possibilities in the analysis of the high-definition
human connectome: from now on we can work with a robust assignment of
directions of the connections of the human brain.
