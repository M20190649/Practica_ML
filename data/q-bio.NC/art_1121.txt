The grammar of mammalian brain capacity
Uniquely human abilities may arise from special-purpose brain circuitry, or
from concerted general capacity increases due to our outsized brains. We
forward a novel hypothesis of the relation between computational capacity and
brain size, linking mathematical formalisms of grammars with the allometric
increases in cortical-subcortical ratios that arise in large brains. In sum, i)
thalamocortical loops compute formal grammars; ii) successive cortical regions
describe grammar rewrite rules of increasing size; iii) cortical-subcortical
ratios determine the quantity of stacks in single-stack pushdown grammars; iii)
quantitative increase of stacks yields grammars with qualitatively increased
computational power. We arrive at the specific conjecture that human brain
capacity is equivalent to that of indexed grammars, far short of full
Turing-computable (recursively enumerable) systems. The work provides a
candidate explanatory account of a range of existing human and animal data,
addressing longstanding questions of how repeated similar brain algorithms can
be successfully applied to apparently dissimilar computational tasks (e.g.,
perceptual versus cognitive, phonological versus syntactic); and how
quantitative increases to brains can confer qualitative changes to their
computational repertoire.
