infotheory: A C++/Python package for multivariate information theoretic
  analysis
This paper introduces \texttt{infotheory}: a package written in C++ and
usable from Python and C++, for multivariate information theoretic analyses of
discrete and continuous data. This package allows the user to study the
relationship between components of a complex system simply from the data
recorded during its operation, using the tools of information theory. It
implements widely used measures such as entropy and mutual information, as well
as more recent measures that arise from multivariate extensions to information
theory, specifically Partial Information Decomposition. It provides an
easy-to-use and flexible tool for use in research as well as pedgogical
purposes to introduce students to information theory. Website:
