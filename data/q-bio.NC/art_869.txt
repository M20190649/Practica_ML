Visual motion processing and human tracking behavior
The accurate visual tracking of a moving object is a human fundamental skill
that allows to reduce the relative slip and instability of the object's image
on the retina, thus granting a stable, high-quality vision. In order to
optimize tracking performance across time, a quick estimate of the object's
global motion properties needs to be fed to the oculomotor system and
dynamically updated. Concurrently, performance can be greatly improved in terms
of latency and accuracy by taking into account predictive cues, especially
under variable conditions of visibility and in presence of ambiguous retinal
information. Here, we review several recent studies focusing on the integration
of retinal and extra-retinal information for the control of human smooth
pursuit.By dynamically probing the tracking performance with well established
paradigms in the visual perception and oculomotor literature we provide the
basis to test theoretical hypotheses within the framework of dynamic
probabilistic inference. We will in particular present the applications of
these results in light of state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.
