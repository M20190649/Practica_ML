The Beer Can Theory of Creativity
This chapter explores the cognitive mechanisms underlying the emergence and
evolution of cultural novelty. Section Two summarizes the rationale for viewing
the process by which the fruits of the mind take shape as they spread from one
individual to another as a form of evolution, and briefly discusses a computer
model of this process. Section Three presents theoretical and empirical
evidence that the sudden proliferation of human culture approximately two
million years ago began with the capacity for creativity: that is, the ability
to generate novelty strategically and contextually. The next two sections take
a closer look at the creative process. Section Four examines the mechanisms
underlying the fluid, associative thought that constitutes the inspirational
component of creativity. Section Five explores how that initial flicker of
inspiration crystallizes into a solid, workable idea as it gets mulled over in
light of the various constraints and affordances of the world into which it
will be born. Finally, Section Six wraps things up with a few speculative
thoughts about the overall unfolding of this evolutionary process.
