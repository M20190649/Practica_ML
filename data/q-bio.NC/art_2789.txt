Leaders and followers: Quantifying consistency in spatio-temporal
  propagation patterns
Repetitive spatio-temporal propagation patterns are encountered in fields as
wide-ranging as climatology, social communication and network science. In
neuroscience, perfectly consistent repetitions of the same global propagation
pattern are called a synfire pattern. For any recording of sequences of
discrete events (in neuroscience terminology: sets of spike trains) the
questions arise how closely it resembles such a synfire pattern and which are
the spike trains that lead/follow. Here we address these questions and
introduce an algorithm built on two new indicators, termed SPIKE-Order and
Spike Train Order, that define the Synfire Indicator value, which allows to
sort multiple spike trains from leader to follower and to quantify the
consistency of the temporal leader-follower relationships for both the original
and the optimized sorting. We demonstrate our new approach using artificially
generated datasets before we apply it to analyze the consistency of propagation
patterns in two real datasets from neuroscience (Giant Depolarized Potentials
in mice slices) and climatology (El Ni~no sea surface temperature recordings).
The new algorithm is distinguished by conceptual and practical simplicity, low
computational cost, as well as flexibility and universality.
