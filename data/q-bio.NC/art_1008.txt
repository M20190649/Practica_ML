Review of analytical instruments for EEG analysis
Since it was first used in 1926, EEG has been one of the most useful
instruments of neuroscience. In order to start using EEG data we need not only
EEG apparatus, but also some analytical tools and skills to understand what our
data mean. This article describes several classical analytical tools and also
new one which appeared only several years ago. We hope it will be useful for
those researchers who have only started working in the field of cognitive EEG.
