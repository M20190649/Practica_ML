Distribution of Human Response Times
We demonstrate that distributions of human response times have power-law
tails and, among closed-form distributions, are best fit by the generalized
inverse gamma distribution. We speculate that the task difficulty tracks the
half-width of the distribution and show that it is related to the exponent of
the power-law tail.
