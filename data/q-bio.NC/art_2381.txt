A Gauge Field Model of Modal Completion
Perceptual completion of figures is a basic process revealing the deep
architecture of low level vision. In this paper a complete gauge field
Lagrangian is proposed allowing to couple the retinex equation with
neurogeometrical models and to solve the problem of modal completion, i.e. the
pop up of the Kanizsa triangle. Euler-Lagrange equations are derived by
variational calculus and numerically solved. Plausible neurophysiological
implementations of the particle and field equations are discussed and a model
of the interaction between LGN and visual cortex is proposed.
