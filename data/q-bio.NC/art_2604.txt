Testing quantum-like models of judgment for question order effect
Lately, so-called "quantum" models, based on parts of the mathematics of
quantum mechanics, have been developed in decision theory and cognitive
sciences to account for seemingly irrational or paradoxical human judgments. We
consider here some such quantum-like models that address question order
effects, i.e. cases in which given answers depend on the order of presentation
of the questions. Models of various dimensionalities could be used, can the
simplest ones be empirically adequate? From the quantum law of reciprocity, we
derive new empirical predictions that we call the Grand Reciprocity equations,
that must be satisfied by several existing quantum-like models, in their
non-degenerate versions. Using substantial existing data sets, we show that
these non-degenerate versions fail the GR test in most cases, which means that,
if quantum-like models of the kind considered here are to work, it can only be
in their degenerate versions. However, we suggest that the route of degenerate
models is not necessarily an easy one, and we argue for more research on the
empirical adequacy of degenerate quantum-like models in general.
