Only T3-AI can reach human-level intelligence: A variety argument
The recently introduced theory of practopoiesis offers an account on how
adaptive intelligent systems are organized. According to that theory biological
agents adapt at three levels of organization and this structure applies also to
our brains. This is referred to as tri-traversal theory of the organization of
mind or for short, a T3-structure. To implement a similar T3-organization in an
artificially intelligent agent, it is necessary to have multiple policies, as
usually used as a concept in the theory of reinforcement learning. These
policies have to form a hierarchy. We define adaptive practopoietic systems in
terms of hierarchy of policies and calculate whether the total variety of
behavior required by real-life conditions of an adult human can be
satisfactorily accounted for by a traditional approach to artificial
intelligence based on T2-agents, or whether a T3-agent is needed instead. We
conclude that the complexity of real life can be dealt with appropriately only
by a T3-agent.
