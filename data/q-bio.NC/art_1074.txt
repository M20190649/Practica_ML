The modular organization of human anatomical brain networks: Accounting
  for the cost of wiring
Brain networks are expected to be modular. However, existing techniques for
estimating a network's modules make it difficult to assess the influence of
organizational principles such as wiring cost reduction on the detected
modules. Here, we present a modification of an existing module detection
algorithm that allows us to focus on connections that are unexpected under a
cost-reduction wiring rule and to identify modules from among these
connections. We apply this technique to anatomical brain networks and show that
the modules we detect differ from those detected using the standard technique.
We demonstrate that these novel modules are spatially distributed, exhibit
unique functional fingerprints, and overlap considerably with rich clubs,
giving rise to an alternative and complementary interpretation of the
functional roles of specific brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate that, using
the modified module detection approach, we can detect modules in a
developmental dataset that track normative patterns of maturation.
Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that brain networks are
composed of modules and provide additional insight into the function of those
modules.
