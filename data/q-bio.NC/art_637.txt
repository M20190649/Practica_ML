Development of modularity in the neural activity of children's brains
We study how modularity of the human brain changes as children develop into
adults. Theory suggests that modularity can enhance the response function of a
networked system subject to changing external stimuli. Thus, greater cognitive
performance might be achieved for more modular neural activity, and modularity
might likely increase as children develop. The value of modularity calculated
from fMRI data is observed to increase during childhood development and peak in
young adulthood. Head motion is deconvolved from the fMRI data, and it is shown
that the dependence of modularity on age is independent of the magnitude of
head motion. A model is presented to illustrate how modularity can provide
greater cognitive performance at short times, i.e.\ task switching. A fitness
function is extracted from the model. Quasispecies theory is used to predict
how the average modularity evolves with age, illustrating the increase of
modularity during development from children to adults that arises from
selection for rapid cognitive function in young adults. Experiments exploring
the effect of modularity on cognitive performance are suggested. Modularity may
be a potential biomarker for injury, rehabilitation, or disease.
