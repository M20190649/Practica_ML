Fast {\large\it Cl-}type inhibitory neuron with delayed feedback has
  non-markov output statistics
For a class of fast {\it Cl-}type inhibitory spiking neuron models with
delayed feedback fed with a Poisson stochastic process of excitatory impulses,
it is proven that the stream of output interspike intervals cannot be presented
as a Markov process of any order.
