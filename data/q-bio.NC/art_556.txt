Untersuchungen zur Modellierung und Schaltungsrealisierung von
  synaptischer Plastizitaet
This manuscript deals with the analysis and VLSI implementation of adaptive
information processing derived from biological measurements. Specifically,
models for short term plasticity, long term plasticity and metaplasticity are
derived from biological measurements and implemented in CMOS circuits.
