On the electrodynamics of neural networks
We present a microscopic approach for the coupling of cortical activity, as
resulting from proper dipole currents of pyramidal neurons, to the
electromagnetic field in extracellular fluid in presence of diffusion and Ohmic
conduction. Starting from a full-fledged three-compartment model of a single
pyramidal neuron, including shunting and dendritic propagation, we derive an
observation model for dendritic dipole currents in extracellular space and
thereby for the dendritic field potential that contributes to the local field
potential of a neural population. Under reasonable simplifications, we then
derive a leaky integrate-and-fire model for the dynamics of a neural network,
which facilitates comparison with existing neural network and observation
models. In particular, we compare our results with a related model by means of
numerical simulations. Performing a continuum limit, neural activity becomes
represented by a neural field equation, while an observation model for electric
field potentials is obtained from the interaction of cortical dipole currents
with charge density in non-resistive extracellular space as described by the
Nernst-Planck equation. Our work consistently satisfies the widespread dipole
assumption discussed in the neuroscientific literature.
