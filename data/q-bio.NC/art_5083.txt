Is coding a relevant metaphor for building AI? A commentary on "Is
  coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?", by Romain Brette
Brette contends that the neural coding metaphor is an invalid basis for
theories of what the brain does. Here, we argue that it is an insufficient
guide for building an artificial intelligence that learns to accomplish short-
and long-term goals in a complex, changing environment.
