Simultaneous multi-patch-clamp and extracellular-array recordings:
  Single neuron reflects network activity
The increasing number of recording electrodes enhances the capability of
capturing the network's cooperative activity, however, using too many monitors
might alter the properties of the measured neural network and induce noise.
Using a technique that merges simultaneous multi-patch-clamp and
multi-electrode array recordings of neural networks in-vitro, we show that the
membrane potential of a single neuron is a reliable and super-sensitive probe
for monitoring such cooperative activities and their detailed rhythms.
Specifically, the membrane potential and the spiking activity of a single
neuron are either highly correlated or highly anti-correlated with the
time-dependent macroscopic activity of the entire network. This surprising
observation also sheds light on the cooperative origin of neuronal burst in
cultured networks. Our findings present an alternative flexible approach to the
technique based on a massive tiling of networks by large-scale arrays of
electrodes to monitor their activity.
