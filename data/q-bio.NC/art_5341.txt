Desynchronization and pattern formation in a noisy feedforward
  oscillators network
We consider a one-dimensional directional array of diffusively coupled
oscillators. They are perturbed by the injection of a small additive noise,
typically orders of magnitude smaller than the oscillation amplitude, and the
system is studied in a region of the parameters that would yield deterministic
synchronization. Non normal directed couplings seed a coherent amplification of
the perturbation: this latter manifests as a modulation, transversal to the
limit cycle, which gains in potency node after node. If the lattice extends
long enough, the initial synchrony gets eventually lost and the system moves
toward a non trivial attractor, which can be analytically characterized as an
asymptotic splay state. The noise assisted instability, ultimately vehiculated
and amplified by the non normal nature of the imposed couplings, eventually
destabilizes also this second attractor. This phenomenon yields spatiotemporal
patterns, which cannot be anticipated by a conventional linear stability
analysis.
