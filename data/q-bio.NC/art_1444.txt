Electronic schematic for bio-plausible dopamine neuromodulation of eSTDP
  and iSTDP
In this technical report we present novel results of the dopamine
bio-plausible neuromodulation excitatory (eSTDP) and inhibitory (iSTDP)
learning. We present the principal schematic for the neuromodulation of D1 and
D2 receptors of dopamine, wiring schematic for both cases as well as the
simulatory experiments results done in LTSpice.
