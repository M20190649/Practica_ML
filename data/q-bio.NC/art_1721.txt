Disagreeing about Crocs and socks: Creating profoundly ambiguous color
  displays
There is an increasing interest in the systematic disagreement about
profoundly ambiguous stimuli in the color domain. However, this research has
been hobbled by the fact that we could not create such stimuli at will. Here,
we describe a design principle that allows the creation of such stimuli and
apply this principle to create one such stimulus set - the crocs and socks.
Using this set, we probed the color perception of a large sample of observers,
showing that these stimuli are indeed categorically ambiguous and that we can
predict the percept from fabric priors resulting from experience. We also
relate the perception of these crocs to other color-ambiguous stimuli - the
dress and the sneaker and conclude that differential priors likely underlie
polarized disagreement in cognition more generally.
