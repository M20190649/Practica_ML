Criticality in the brain: A synthesis of neurobiology, models and
  cognition
Cognitive function requires the coordination of neural activity across many
scales, from neurons and circuits to large-scale networks. As such, it is
unlikely that an explanatory framework focused upon any single scale will yield
a comprehensive theory of brain activity and cognitive function. Modelling and
analysis methods for neuroscience should aim to accommodate multiscale
phenomena. Emerging research now suggests that multi-scale processes in the
brain arise from so-called critical phenomena that occur very broadly in the
natural world. Criticality arises in complex systems perched between order and
disorder, and is marked by fluctuations that do not have any privileged spatial
or temporal scale. We review the core nature of criticality, the evidence
supporting its role in neural systems and its explanatory potential in brain
health and disease.
