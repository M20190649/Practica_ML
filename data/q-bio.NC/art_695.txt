How we move is universal: scaling in the average shape of human activity
Human motor activity is constrained by the rhythmicity of the 24 hours
circadian cycle, including the usual 12-15 hours sleep-wake cycle. However,
activity fluctuations also appear over a wide range of temporal scales, from
days to a few seconds, resulting from the concatenation of a myriad of
individual smaller motor events. Furthermore, individuals present different
propensity to wakefulness and thus to motor activity throughout the circadian
cycle. Are activity fluctuations across temporal scales intrinsically
different, or is there a universal description encompassing them? Is this
description also universal across individuals, considering the aforementioned
variability? Here we establish the presence of universality in motor activity
fluctuations based on the empirical study of a month of continuous wristwatch
accelerometer recordings. We study the scaling of average fluctuations across
temporal scales and determine a universal law characterized by critical
exponents $\alpha$, $\tau$ and $1/{\mu}$. Results are highly reminiscent of the
universality described for the average shape of avalanches in systems
exhibiting crackling noise. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the present
results can be important for developing objective markers of healthy as well as
pathological human motor behavior.
