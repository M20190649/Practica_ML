A new stimulus approach in the search for biological nonlocality
Preliminary research in the area of biophysics appears to indicate the
existence of quantum entanglement and nonlocality at the biological level, both
for human subjects and for neurons derived from human neural stem cells. The
lack of clear and replicable findings, especially where human subjects are
concerned, results in conflicting and marginal correlations between stimulated
and nonstimulated subject's brainwaves. It is proposed to go beyond the use of
just patterned photostimulation, to encompass either transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) or acupuncture, so that one can achieve a simultaneity of
several different brain events in both stimulated and nonstimulated subjects,
rather than just one EEG-type event.
