Evolution and development of Brain Networks: From Caenorhabditis elegans
  to Homo sapiens
Neural networks show a progressive increase in complexity during the time
course of evolution. From diffuse nerve nets in Cnidaria to modular,
hierarchical systems in macaque and humans, there is a gradual shift from
simple processes involving a limited amount of tasks and modalities to complex
functional and behavioral processing integrating different kinds of information
from highly specialized tissue. However, studies in a range of species suggest
that fundamental similarities, in spatial and topological features as well as
in developmental mechanisms for network formation, are retained across
evolution. 'Small-world' topology and highly connected regions (hubs) are
prevalent across the evolutionary scale, ensuring efficient processing and
resilience to internal (e.g. lesions) and external (e.g. environment) changes.
Furthermore, in most species, even the establishment of hubs, long-range
connections linking distant components, and a modular organization, relies on
similar mechanisms. In conclusion, evolutionary divergence leads to greater
complexity while following essential developmental constraints.
