Subthreshold oscillations in a map-based neuron model
Self-sustained subthreshold oscillations in a discrete-time model of neuronal
behavior are considered. We discuss bifurcation scenarios explaining the birth
of these oscillations and their transformation into tonic spikes. Specific
features of these transitions caused by the discrete-time dynamics of the model
and the influence of external noise are discussed.
