Progress in Brain Computer Interfaces: Challenges and Trends
Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between
the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended
degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral
working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as
rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming and artificial
intelligence. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered
common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex
and nonlinear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification
challenges. Psycho-neurophysiological phenomena and their impact on brain
signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the
technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review
summarizes progress in BCI field and highlights critical challenges.
