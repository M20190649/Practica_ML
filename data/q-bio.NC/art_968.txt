Beta Distribution of Human MTL Neuron Sparsity: A Sparse and Skewed Code
Single unit recordings in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) have revealed
a population of cells with conceptually based, highly selective activity,
indicating the presence of a sparse neural code. Building off previous work by
the author and J.C. Collins, this paper develops a statistical model for
analyzing this data, based on maximum likelihood analysis. The goal is to infer
the underlying distribution of neural response probabilities across the
population of MTL cells. The response probability, or neuronal sparsity, is
defined as the total probability that the neuron produces an above-threshold
firing rate during the presentation of a randomly selected stimulus. Applying
the method, it is shown that a beta-distributed neuronal sparsity across the
cells of the MTL is consistent with the data. The resulting fits reveal a
sparse and highly skewed code, with a huge majority of neurons exhibiting
extremely low response probabilities, and a smaller minority possessing
considerably higher response probabilities. The distributions are closely
approximated by a power law at low sparsity values. Strikingly similar skewed
distributions have been found in the statistics of place cell activity in rats,
suggesting similar underlying coding dynamics between the human MTL and the rat
hippocampus.
