The Compositional Nature of Verb and Argument Representations in the
  Human Brain
How does the human brain represent simple compositions of objects, actors,and
actions? We had subjects view action sequence videos during neuroimaging (fMRI)
sessions and identified lexical descriptions of those videos by decoding (SVM)
the brain representations based only on their fMRI activation patterns. As a
precursor to this result, we had demonstrated that we could reliably and with
high probability decode action labels corresponding to one of six action videos
(dig, walk, etc.), again while subjects viewed the action sequence during
scanning (fMRI). This result was replicated at two different brain imaging
sites with common protocols but different subjects, showing common brain areas,
including areas known for episodic memory (PHG, MTL, high level visual
pathways, etc.,i.e. the 'what' and 'where' systems, and TPJ, i.e. 'theory of
mind'). Given these results, we were also able to successfully show a key
aspect of language compositionality based on simultaneous decoding of object
class and actor identity. Finally, combining these novel steps in 'brain
reading' allowed us to accurately estimate brain representations supporting
compositional decoding of a complex event composed of an actor, a verb, a
direction, and an object.
