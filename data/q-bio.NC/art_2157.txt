Response of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to a periodic sequence of biphasic
  pulses
We study the response of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron stimulated periodically by
biphasic rectangular current pulses. The optimal response for charge-balanced
input is obtained for cathodic-first pulses with an inter-phase gap (IPG)
approximately equal 5 ms. For short pulses the topology of the global
bifurcation diagram in the period-amplitude plane is approximately invariant
with respect to the pulse polarity and shape details. If stimuli are delivered
at neuron's resonant frequencies the firing rate is a continuous function of
pulse amplitude. At nonresonant frequencies the quiescent state and the firing
state coexist over a range of amplitude values and the transition to
excitability is a discontinuous one. There is a multimodal odd-all transition
between the 2:1 and 3:1 locked-in states. A strong antiresonant effect is found
between the states 3:1 and 4:1, where the modes (2+3n):1, $n=0,1,2,...$, are
entirely absent. At high frequencies the excitation threshold is a nonmonotonic
function of the stimulus and the perithreshold region is bistable, with the
quiescent state coexisting with either a regular or chaotic firing.
