Pain and Spontaneous Thought
Pain is among the most salient of experiences while also, curiously, being
among the most malleable. A large body of research has revealed that a
multitude of explicit strategies can be used to effectively alter the
attention-demanding quality of acute and chronic pains and their associated
neural correlates. However, thoughts that are spontaneous, rather than actively
generated, are common in daily life, and so attention to pain can often
temporally fluctuate because of ongoing self-generated experiences. Classic
pain theories have largely neglected to account for unconstrained fluctuations
in cognition, but new studies have demonstrated the behavioral-relevance,
putative neural basis, and individual variability of interactions between pain
and spontaneous thoughts. In this chapter, I review behavioral studies of
ongoing fluctuations in attention to pain, studies of the neural basis of
spontaneous mind-wandering away from pain, and the clinical implications of
this research.
