Balanced activation in a simple embodied neural simulation
In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of
spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we explore a model of spontaneous neural
dynamics and allow it to control a virtual agent moving in a simple
environment. This setup generates interesting brain-environment feedback
interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics and
suggest the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for both
local homeostatic plasticity (local inhibition adjusting over time to balance
excitatory input) as well as macroscopic task negative activity (that
compensates for task positive, sensory input) in regulating both neural
activity and resulting behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our
results suggest complementary functional roles for both local homeostatic
plasticity and balanced activity across brain regions in maintaining neural and
behavioral dynamics. These findings suggest important functional roles for
homeostatic systems in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and suggest a
novel functional role for frequently reported macroscopic task-negative
patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).
