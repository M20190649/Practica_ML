Optimal prediction and natural scene statistics in the retina
Almost all neural computations involve making predictions. Whether an
organism is trying to catch prey, avoid predators, or simply move through a
complex environment, the data it collects through its senses can guide its
actions only to the extent that it can extract from these data information
about the future state of the world. An essential aspect of the problem in all
these forms is that not all features of the past carry predictive power. Since
there are costs associated with representing and transmitting information, a
natural hypothesis is that sensory systems have developed coding strategies
that are optimized to minimize these costs, keeping only a limited number of
bits of information about the past and ensuring that these bits are maximally
informative about the future. Another important feature of the prediction
problem is that the physics of the world is diverse enough to contain a wide
range of possible statistical ensembles, yet not all motion is probable. Thus,
the brain might not be a generalized predictive machine; it might have evolved
to specifically solve the prediction problems most common in the natural
environment. This paper reviews recent results on predictive coding and optimal
predictive information in the retina and suggests approaches for quantifying
prediction in response to natural motion.
