Transformation of stimulus correlations by the retina
Redundancies and correlations in the responses of sensory neurons seem to
waste neural resources but can carry cues about structured stimuli and may help
the brain to correct for response errors. To assess how the retina negotiates
this tradeoff, we measured simultaneous responses from populations of ganglion
cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli that varied greatly in
correlation structure. We found that pairwise correlations in the retinal
output remained similar across stimuli with widely different spatio-temporal
correlations including white noise and natural movies. Meanwhile, purely
spatial correlations tended to increase correlations in the retinal response.
Responding to more correlated stimuli, ganglion cells had faster temporal
kernels and tended to have stronger surrounds. These properties of individual
cells, along with gain changes that opposed changes in effective contrast at
the ganglion cell input, largely explained the similarity of pairwise
correlations across stimuli where receptive field measurements were possible.
