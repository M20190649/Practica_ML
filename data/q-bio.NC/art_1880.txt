Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Of Local People Impacted By Dam Construction: Their
  Demands Regarding Resettlement
Fuzzy cognitive mapping was used to understand the wants and desires of local
people before resettlement. Variables that the affected people think will
increase their welfare during and after dam construction were determined.
Simulations were done with their cumulative social cognitive map to determine
which policy options would most increase their welfare. The construction of
roads, job opportunities, advance payment of condemnation value, and schools
are central variables that had the most effect on increasing people's income
and welfare. The synergistic effects of variables demonstrated that the
implementation of different policies not only add cumulatively to the people's
welfare but also have an increased effect.
