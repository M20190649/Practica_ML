The Evolution of Intelligence
How did the human species evolve the capacity not just to communicate complex
ideas to one another but to hold such conversations from across the globe,
using remote devices constructed from substances that do not exist in the
natural world, the raw materials for which may have been hauled up from the
bowels of the earth? How did we come to be so intelligent? Research at the
interface of psychology, biology, anthropology, archaeology, and cognitive
science is culminating in an increasingly sophisticated understanding of how
human intelligence evolved. Studies of the brains of living humans and great
apes and the intellectual abilities they support are enabling us to assess what
is unique about human intelligence and what we share with our primate
relatives. Examining the habitats and skeletons of our ancestors gives cues as
to environmental, social, and anatomical factors that both constrain and enable
the evolution of human intelligence. Relics of the past also have much to tell
us about the thoughts, beliefs, and abilities of the individuals who invented
and used them.
