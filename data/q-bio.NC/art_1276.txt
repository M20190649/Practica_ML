Network constraints on learnability of probabilistic motor sequences
Human learners are adept at grasping the complex relationships underlying
incoming sequential input. In the present work, we formalize complex
relationships as graph structures derived from temporal associations in motor
sequences. Next, we explore the extent to which learners are sensitive to key
variations in the topological properties inherent to those graph structures.
Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order
of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular,
lattice-like, or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique
button press and edges represented a transition between button presses. Results
indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was
strongly mediated by the graph's meso-scale organization, with modular graphs
being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs.
Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's
role in mediating long-distance communication (betweenness centrality) impacted
graph learning, even after accounting for level of practice on that node. These
results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences
of stimuli fundamentally constrains learning, and moreover that tools from
network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode
complex, temporally structured information.
