Mapping multiplex hubs in human functional brain network
Typical brain networks consist of many peripheral regions and a few highly
central ones, i.e. hubs, playing key functional roles in cerebral
inter-regional interactions. Studies have shown that networks, obtained from
the analysis of specific frequency components of brain activity, present
peculiar architectures with unique profiles of region centrality. However, the
identification of hubs in networks built from different frequency bands
simultaneously is still a challenging problem, remaining largely unexplored.
Here we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex network
and face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of
multiplex topologies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique
topological information, fundamental to accurately model brain functional
networks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex network, in general
different from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured
signals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain's most important
functional regions, allowing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic
populations better than conventional network approaches.
