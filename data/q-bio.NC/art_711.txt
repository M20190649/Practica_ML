Searching for behavioral homologies: Shared generative rules for
  expansion and narrowing down of the locomotor repertoire in Arthropods and
  Vertebrates
We use immobility as an origin and reference for the measurement of locomotor
behavior; speed, the direction of walking and the direction of facing as the
three degrees of freedom shaping fly locomotor behavior, and cocaine as the
parameter inducing a progressive transition in and out of immobility. In this
way we expose and quantify the generative rules that shape fruit fly locomotor
behavior, which consist of a gradual narrowing down of the fly's locomotor
freedom of movement during the transition into immobility and a precisely
opposite expansion of freedom during the transition from immobility to normal
behavior. The same generative rules of narrowing down and expansion apply to
vertebrate behavior in a variety of contexts, Recent claims for deep homology
between the vertebrate basal ganglia and the arthropod central complex, and
neurochemical processes explaining the expansion of locomotor behavior in
vertebrates could guide the search for equivalent neurochemical processes that
mediate locomotor narrowing down and expansion in arthropods. We argue that a
methodology for isolating relevant measures and quantifying generative rules
having a potential for discovering candidate behavioral homologies is already
available and we specify some of its essential features.
