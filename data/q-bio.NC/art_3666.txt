Performance Comparison for Neuroscience Application Benchmarks
Researchers within the Human Brain Project and related projects have in the
last couple of years expanded their needs for high-performance computing
infrastructures. The needs arise from a diverse set of science challenges that
range from large-scale simulations of brain models to processing of
extreme-scale experimental data sets. The ICEI project, which is in the process
of creating a distributed infrastructure optimised for brain research, started
to build-up a set of benchmarks that reflect the diversity of applications in
this field. In this paper we analyse the performance of some selected
benchmarks on an IBM POWER8 and Intel Skylake based systems with and without
GPUs.
