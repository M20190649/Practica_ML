Entrainment and chaos in a pulse-driven Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator
The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes action potential generation in certain
types of neurons and is a standard model for conductance-based, excitable
cells. Following the early work of Winfree and Best, this paper explores the
response of a spontaneously spiking Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a periodic
pulsatile drive. The response as a function of drive period and amplitude is
systematically characterized. A wide range of qualitatively distinct responses
are found, including entrainment to the input pulse train and persistent chaos.
These observations are consistent with a theory of kicked oscillators developed
by Qiudong Wang and Lai-Sang Young. In addition to general features predicted
by Wang-Young theory, it is found that most combinations of drive period and
amplitude lead to entrainment instead of chaos. This preference for entrainment
over chaos is explained by the structure of the Hodgkin-Huxley phase resetting
curve.
