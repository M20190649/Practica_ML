PySpike - A Python library for analyzing spike train synchrony
Understanding how the brain functions is one of the biggest challenges of our
time. The analysis of experimentally recorded neural firing patterns (spike
trains) plays a crucial role in addressing this problem. Here, the PySpike
library is introduced, a Python package for spike train analysis providing
parameter-free and time-scale independent measures of spike train synchrony. It
allows to compute similarity and dissimilarity profiles, averaged values and
distance matrices. Although mainly focusing on neuroscience, PySpike can also
be applied in other contexts like climate research or social sciences. The
package is available as Open Source on Github and PyPI.
