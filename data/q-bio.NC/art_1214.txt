Face recognition assessments used in the study of super-recognisers
The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of nine assessments
of face processing skills. These tests have been used commonly in recent years
to gauge the skills of perspective 'super-recognisers' with respect to the
general population. In the literature, a person has been considered to be a
'super-recogniser' based on superior scores on one or more of these tests (cf.,
Noyes, Phillips & O'Toole, in press). The paper provides a supplement to a
recent review of super-recognisers aimed at readers who are unfamiliar with
these tests. That review provides a complete summary of the super-recongiser
literature to date (2017). It also provides a theory and a set of action points
directed at answering the question "What is a super-recogniser?"
