Dynamical response of the Hodgkin-Huxley model in the high-input regime
The response of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model subjected to stochastic
uncorrelated spike trains originating from a large number of inhibitory and
excitatory post-synaptic potentials is analyzed in detail. The model is
examined in its three fundamental dynamical regimes: silence, bistability and
repetitive firing. Its response is characterized in terms of statistical
indicators (interspike-interval distributions and their first moments) as well
as of dynamical indicators (autocorrelation functions and conditional
entropies). In the silent regime, the coexistence of two different coherence
resonances is revealed: one occurs at quite low noise and is related to the
stimulation of subthreshold oscillations around the rest state; the second one
(at intermediate noise variance) is associated with the regularization of the
sequence of spikes emitted by the neuron. Bistability in the low noise limit
can be interpreted in terms of jumping processes across barriers activated by
stochastic fluctuations. In the repetitive firing regime a maximization of
incoherence is observed at finite noise variance. Finally, the mechanisms
responsible for spike triggering in the various regimes are clearly identified.
