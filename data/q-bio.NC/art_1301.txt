Deterministic networks for probabilistic computing
Neural-network models of high-level brain functions such as memory recall and
reasoning often rely on the presence of stochasticity. The majority of these
models assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its
own private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external
noise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is
limited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large
networks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting
shared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of
stochastic network models. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by
using deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of uncorrelated noise,
exploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback. Consequently, even
a single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can serve as a natural
noise source for large ensembles of functional networks, each comprising
thousands of units. We successfully apply the proposed framework to a diverse
set of binary-unit networks with different dimensionalities and entropies, as
well as to a network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined
frequencies. Finally, we show that the same design transfers to functional
networks of spiking neurons.
