Symmetries constrain dynamics in a family of balanced neural networks
We examine a family of random firing-rate neural networks in which we enforce
the neurobiological constraint of Dale's Law --- each neuron makes either
excitatory or inhibitory connections onto its post-synaptic targets. We find
that this constrained system may be described as a perturbation from a system
with non-trivial symmetries. We analyze the symmetric system using the tools of
equivariant bifurcation theory, and demonstrate that the symmetry-implied
structures remain evident in the perturbed system. In comparison, spectral
characteristics of the network coupling matrix are relatively uninformative
about the behavior of the constrained system.
