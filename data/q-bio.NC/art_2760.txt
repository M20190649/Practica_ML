On higher order computations and synaptic meta-plasticity in the human
  brain: IT point of view (June, 2016)
Glia modify neuronal connectivity by creating structural changes in the
neuronal connectome. Glia also influence the functional connectome by modifying
the flow of information through neural networks (Fields et al. 2015). There are
strong experimental evidences that glia are responsible for synaptic
meta-plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the modification of the strength of
connections between neurons. Meta-plasticity, i.e. plasticity of synaptic
plasticity, may be viewed as mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration of neuron
circuits. First order computations in the brain are done by static neuron
circuits, whereas higher order computations are done by dynamic
reconfigurations of the links (synapses) between the neuron circuits. Static
neuron circuits correspond to first order computable functions. Synapse
creation correspond to the mathematical notion of function composition.
Functionals are higher order functions that take functions as their arguments.
The construction of functionals is based on dynamic reconfigurations of the
function composition. Perhaps the functionals correspond to the meta-plasticity
in the human brain.
