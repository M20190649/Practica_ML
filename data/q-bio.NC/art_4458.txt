Non-classicality in mental states : an experimental study with ambiguous
  audio (music) stimuli
This paper attempts to address the question that whether the present physical
or mathematical theories are sufficient to understand the complexities of human
brain when it interacts with the external environment in the form of an
auditory stimulus.There have been efforts reporting that the introduction of
ambiguity in visual stimuli causes effects which can't be explained
classically.In this paper,it is investigated whether ambiguity in auditory
stimuli can introduce any non-classical effects in human brain.Simple
experiments were performed on normal subjects where they listened to an
ambiguous auditory signal and responded to a question with 'yes' or 'no'.The
outcome of the test showed that the classical formula of total probability does
not hold true in this case.Results were interesting and indicate that there is
a definite non-classicality in mental states in perception of ambiguous audio
stimuli.
