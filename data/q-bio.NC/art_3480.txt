Gamma-Band Correlations in Primary Visual Cortex
Neural field theory is used to quantitatively analyze the two-dimensional
spatiotemporal correlation properties of gamma-band (30 -- 70 Hz) oscillations
evoked by stimuli arriving at the primary visual cortex (V1), and modulated by
patchy connectivities that depend on orientation preference (OP). Correlation
functions are derived analytically under different stimulus and measurement
conditions. The predictions reproduce a range of published experimental
results, including the existence of two-point oscillatory temporal
cross-correlations with zero time-lag between neurons with similar OP, the
influence of spatial separation of neurons on the strength of the correlations,
and the effects of differing stimulus orientations.
