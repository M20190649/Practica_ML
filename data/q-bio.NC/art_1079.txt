Modulation of sensory information processing by a neuroglobin in C.
  elegans
Sensory receptor neurons match their dynamic range to ecologically relevant
stimulus intensities. How this tuning is achieved is poorly understood in most
receptors. We show that in the C. elegans URX O2 sensing neurons two putative
molecular O2 sensors, a neuroglobin and O2-binding soluble guanylate cyclases,
work antagonistically to sculpt a slowly sigmoidal O2 response curve tuned to
approach saturation when O2 reaches 21%. glb-5 imposes this sigmoidal function
by inhibiting O2-evoked Ca2+ responses in URX when O2 levels fall. Without
GLB-5, the URX response curve approaches saturation at 15% O2. Behaviorally,
GLB-5 signaling broadens the O2 preference of C. elegans while maintaining
strong avoidance of 21% O2. Our computational aerotaxis model suggests that the
relationship between GLB-5-modulated URX responses and reversal behavior is
sufficient to broaden O2-preference. Thus, a neuroglobin can shift neural
information coding leading to a change in perception and altered behavior.
