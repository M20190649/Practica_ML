A Wavelet Analysis of Transient Spike Trains of Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons
Transient spike trains consisting of $M$ (= 1 - 5) pulses generated by single
Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons, have been analyzed by using both the continuous
and discrete wavelet transformations (WT). We have studied effects of
variations in the interspike intervals (ISI) of the spikes and effects of
noises on the energy distribution and the wavelet entropy, which are expressed
in terms of the WT expansion coefficients. The results obtained by the WT are
discussed in connection with those obtained by the Fourier transformation.
