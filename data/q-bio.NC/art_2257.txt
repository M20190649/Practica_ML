Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality in cognitive processes
The Leggett and Garg Inequality (LGI) is a test of the classical behaviour of
an observed system, in the case of a single measurement channel monitored at
different times. Here we report LGI violation in cognitive tasks consisting in
the identification of mutually incompatible words with negligible semantic
content; the violation is maximal at an inter-measurement time {\tau}LG around
2 sec, close to, but consistently lower than, the characteristic times
associated with other, semantically rich, linguistic endeavors. The LGI
violation persists over a time window of 1 sec around {\tau}LG; outside this
window LGI is recovered.
