Seeking for a fingerprint: analysis of point processes in actigraphy
  recording
Motor activity of humans displays complex temporal fluctuations which can be
characterized by scale-invariant statistics, thus documenting that structure
and fluctuations of such kinetics remain similar over a broad range of time
scales. Former studies on humans regularly deprived of sleep or suffering from
sleep disorders predicted change in the invariant scale parameters with respect
to those representative for healthy subjects. In this study we investigate the
signal patterns from actigraphy recordings by means of characteristic measures
of fractional point processes. We analyse spontaneous locomotor activity of
healthy individuals recorded during a week of regular sleep and a week of
chronic partial sleep deprivation. Behavioural symptoms of lack of sleep can be
evaluated by analysing statistics of duration times during active and resting
states, and alteration of behavioural organization can be assessed by analysis
of power laws detected in the event count distribution, distribution of waiting
times between consecutive movements and detrended fluctuation analysis of
recorded time series. We claim that among different measures characterizing
complexity of the actigraphy recordings and their variations implied by chronic
sleep distress, the exponents characterizing slopes of survival functions in
resting states are the most effective biomarkers distinguishing between healthy
and sleep-deprived groups.
