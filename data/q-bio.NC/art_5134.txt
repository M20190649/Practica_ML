Imperfect fifths pack into musical scales
Musical scales are used in cultures throughout the world, but the question as
to how they evolved remains open. Some suggest that scales based on the
harmonic series are inherently pleasant, while others propose that scales are
chosen that are easy to sing, hear and reproduce accurately. However, testing
these theories has been hindered by the sparseness of empirical evidence. Here,
to enable such examination, we assimilate data from diverse ethnomusicological
sources into a cross-cultural database of scales. We generate populations of
scales based on proposed and alternative theories and assess their similarity
to empirical distributions from the database. Most scales can be explained as
tending to include intervals roughly corresponding to perfect fifths
("imperfect fifths"), and packing arguments explain the salient features of the
distributions. Scales are also preferred if their intervals are compressible,
which could facilitate efficient communication and memory of melodies. While no
single theory can explain all scales, which appear to evolve according to
different selection pressures, the simplest harmonicity-based, imperfect-fifths
packing model best fits the empirical data.
