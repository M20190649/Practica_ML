A Convolutional Network for Sleep Stages Classification
Sleep stages classification is a crucial task in the context of sleep
studies. It involves the simultaneous analysis of multiple signals recorded
during sleep. However, it is complex and tedious, and even the trained expert
can spend several hours scoring a single night recording. Multiple automatic
methods have tried to solve these problems in the past, most of them by
classifying a feature vector that is engineered for a specific dataset. In this
work, we avoid this bias using a deep learning model that learns relevant
features without human intervention. Particularly, we propose an ensemble of 5
convolutional networks that achieves a kappa index of 0.83 when classifying a
dataset of 500 sleep recordings.
