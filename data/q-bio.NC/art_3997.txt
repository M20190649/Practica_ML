Mixed-mode oscillations and interspike interval statistics in the
  stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model
We study the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo equations, modelling the dynamics of
neuronal action potentials, in parameter regimes characterised by mixed-mode
oscillations. The interspike time interval is related to the random number of
small-amplitude oscillations separating consecutive spikes. We prove that this
number has an asymptotically geometric distribution, whose parameter is related
to the principal eigenvalue of a substochastic Markov chain. We provide
rigorous bounds on this eigenvalue in the small-noise regime, and derive an
approximation of its dependence on the system's parameters for a large range of
noise intensities. This yields a precise description of the probability
distribution of observed mixed-mode patterns and interspike intervals.
