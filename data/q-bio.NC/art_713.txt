Analysis of Pain Hemodynamic Response Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS)
Despite recent advances in brain research, understanding the various signals
for pain and pain intensities in the brain cortex is still a complex task due
to temporal and spatial variations of brain hemodynamics. In this paper we have
investigated pain based on cerebral hemodynamics via near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS). This study presents a pain stimulation experiment that uses three
acupuncture manipulation techniques to safely induce pain in healthy subjects.
Acupuncture pain response was presented and hemodynamic pain signal analysis
showed the presence of dominant channels and their relationship among
surrounding channels, which contribute the further pain research area.
