Normalized neural representations of natural odors
The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of
inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this
network integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them
equally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural
representations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model
of this situation, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse
representations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength
can be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to
discriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition.
The model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with
many molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor
arrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Our work can thus help
to understand how global inhibition shapes normalized odor representations for
further processing in the brain.
