Highly connected neurons spike less frequently in balanced networks
Many biological neuronal networks exhibit highly variable spiking activity.
Balanced networks offer a parsimonious model of this variability. In balanced
networks, strong excitatory synaptic inputs are canceled by strong inhibitory
inputs on average and spiking activity is driven by transient breaks in this
balance. Most previous studies of balanced networks assume a homogeneous or
distance-dependent connectivity structure, but connectivity in biological
cortical networks is more intricate. We use a heterogeneous mean-field theory
of balanced networks to show that heterogeneous in-degrees can break balance,
but balance can be restored by heterogeneous out-degrees that are correlated
with in-degrees. In all examples considered, we find that highly connected
neurons spike less frequently, consistent with recent experimental
observations.
