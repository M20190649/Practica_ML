Integration of continuous-time dynamics in a spiking neural network
  simulator
Contemporary modeling approaches to the dynamics of neural networks consider
two main classes of models: biologically grounded spiking neurons and
functionally inspired rate-based units. The unified simulation framework
presented here supports the combination of the two for multi-scale modeling
approaches, the quantitative validation of mean-field approaches by spiking
network simulations, and an increase in reliability by usage of the same
simulation code and the same network model specifications for both model
classes. While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of
discrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between
neurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions
in spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of
instantaneous and delayed interactions between rate-based models in a spiking
network simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection
and communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework. We
further demonstrate the broad applicability of the framework by considering
various examples from the literature ranging from random networks to neural
field models. The study provides the prerequisite for interactions between
rate-based and spiking models in a joint simulation.
