  Organism and Subjective Human Experience
In this study, alcohol smell and imagination of alcohol has been shown to
change the condition of a human organism.In this study, alcohol smell has been
shown to change the condition of a human organism. Based on the test results,
the presence of alcohol was observed upon breathing out, but was rarely
observed in spits and much rarer in urines. This effect is most evident shortly
after an olfactory perception of alcohol and continues for 60 min for some test
persons. The test persons also noted the appearance of a subjective feeling of
alcohol intoxication. However, the condition developed when the alcohol smell
perception differed from the classical alcohol intoxication, i.e., the test
subjects only have a few intoxication symptoms, and not one person would have
all of them.
