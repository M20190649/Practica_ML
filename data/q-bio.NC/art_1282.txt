Closing the loop between neural network simulators and the OpenAI Gym
Since the enormous breakthroughs in machine learning over the last decade,
functional neural network models are of growing interest for many researchers
in the field of computational neuroscience. One major branch of research is
concerned with biologically plausible implementations of reinforcement
learning, with a variety of different models developed over the recent years.
However, most studies in this area are conducted with custom simulation scripts
and manually implemented tasks. This makes it hard for other researchers to
reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the
performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a
novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field
of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from
computational neuroscience. This toolchain enables researchers in both fields
to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting
biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to
evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments
of varying complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by
implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in
the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments
from the OpenAI Gym.
