Pushing it to the Limit: Adaptation With Dynamically Switching Gain
  Control
With this paper we propose a model to simulate the functional aspects of
light adaptation in retinal photoreceptors. Our model, however, does not link
specific stages to the detailed molecular processes which are thought to
mediate adaptation in real photoreceptors. We rather model the photoreceptor as
a self-adjusting integration device, which adds up properly amplified luminance
signals. The integration process and the amplification obey a switching
behavior that acts to locally shut down the integration process in dependence
on the internal state of the receptor. The mathematical structure of our model
is quite simple, and its computational complexity is quite low. We present
results of computer simulations which demonstrate that our model adapts
properly to at least four orders of input magnitude.
