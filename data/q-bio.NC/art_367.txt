Organizational properties of second-order visual filters sensitive to
  the orientation modulations
Here we show psychophysical study of second-order visual mechanisms sensitive
to the orientation modulations. Selectivity to orientation, phase and spatial
frequency of modulation is measured. Bandwidths for phase (0,5{\pi}) and
orientation (33,75 deg) are defined, but there is no evidence for spatial
frequency selectivity.
