Lognormal distribution of firing time and rate from a single neuron?
Even a single neuron may be able to produce significant lognormal features in
its firing statistics due to noise in the charging ion current. A mathematical
scheme introduced in advanced nanotechnology is relevant for the analysis of
this mechanism in the simplest case, the integrate-and-fire model with white
noise in the charging ion current.
