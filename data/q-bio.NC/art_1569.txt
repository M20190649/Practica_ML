Experimental Comparison of Hardware-Amenable Spike Detection Algorithms
  for iBMIs
This paper presents an experiment based comparison of absolute threshold (AT)
and non-linear energy operator (NEO) spike detection algorithms in
Intra-cortical Brain Machine Interfaces (iBMIs). Results show an average
increase in decoding performance of approx. 5% in monkey A across 28 sessions
recorded over 6 days and approx. 2% in monkey B across 35 sessions recorded
over 8 days when using NEO over AT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first ever reported comparison of spike detection algorithms in an iBMI
experimental framework involving two monkeys. Based on the improvements
observed in an experimental setting backed by previously reported improvements
in simulation studies, we advocate switching from state of the art spike
detection technique - AT to NEO.
