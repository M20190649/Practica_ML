Improving Hypernymy Extraction with Distributional Semantic Classes
In this paper, we show how distributionally-induced semantic classes can be
helpful for extracting hypernyms. We present methods for inducing sense-aware
semantic classes using distributional semantics and using these induced
semantic classes for filtering noisy hypernymy relations. Denoising of
hypernyms is performed by labeling each semantic class with its hypernyms. On
the one hand, this allows us to filter out wrong extractions using the global
structure of distributionally similar senses. On the other hand, we infer
missing hypernyms via label propagation to cluster terms. We conduct a
large-scale crowdsourcing study showing that processing of automatically
extracted hypernyms using our approach improves the quality of the hypernymy
extraction in terms of both precision and recall. Furthermore, we show the
utility of our method in the domain taxonomy induction task, achieving the
state-of-the-art results on a SemEval'16 task on taxonomy induction.
