Abstractive Summarization of Spoken and Written Conversation
Nowadays, lots of information is available in form of dialogues. We propose a
novel abstractive summarization system for conversations. We use sequence
tagging of utterances for identifying the discourse relations of the dialogue.
After aptly capturing these relations in a paragraph, we feed it into an
Attention-based pointer network to produce abstractive summaries. We obtain
ROUGE-1, 2 F-scores similar to those of extractive summaries of various
previous works.
