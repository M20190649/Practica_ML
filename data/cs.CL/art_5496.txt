CVIT-MT Systems for WAT-2018
This document describes the machine translation system used in the
submissions of IIIT-Hyderabad CVIT-MT for the WAT-2018 English-Hindi
translation task. Performance is evaluated on the associated corpus provided by
the organizers. We experimented with convolutional sequence to sequence
architectures. We also train with additional data obtained through
backtranslation.
