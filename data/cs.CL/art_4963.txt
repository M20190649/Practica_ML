WikiConv: A Corpus of the Complete Conversational History of a Large
  Online Collaborative Community
We present a corpus that encompasses the complete history of conversations
between contributors to Wikipedia, one of the largest online collaborative
communities. By recording the intermediate states of conversations---including
not only comments and replies, but also their modifications, deletions and
restorations---this data offers an unprecedented view of online conversation.
This level of detail supports new research questions pertaining to the process
(and challenges) of large-scale online collaboration. We illustrate the corpus'
potential with two case studies that highlight new perspectives on earlier
work. First, we explore how a person's conversational behavior depends on how
they relate to the discussion's venue. Second, we show that community
moderation of toxic behavior happens at a higher rate than previously
estimated. Finally the reconstruction framework is designed to be language
agnostic, and we show that it can extract high quality conversational data in
both Chinese and English.
