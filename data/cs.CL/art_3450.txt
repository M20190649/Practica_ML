XNMT: The eXtensible Neural Machine Translation Toolkit
This paper describes XNMT, the eXtensible Neural Machine Translation toolkit.
XNMT distin- guishes itself from other open-source NMT toolkits by its focus on
modular code design, with the purpose of enabling fast iteration in research
and replicable, reliable results. In this paper we describe the design of XNMT
and its experiment configuration system, and demonstrate its utility on the
tasks of machine translation, speech recognition, and multi-tasked machine
translation/parsing. XNMT is available open-source at
