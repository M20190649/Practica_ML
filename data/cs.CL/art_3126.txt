Page Stream Segmentation with Convolutional Neural Nets Combining
  Textual and Visual Features
In recent years, (retro-)digitizing paper-based files became a major
undertaking for private and public archives as well as an important task in
electronic mailroom applications. As a first step, the workflow involves
scanning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of documents. Preservation of
document contexts of single page scans is a major requirement in this context.
To facilitate workflows involving very large amounts of paper scans, page
stream segmentation (PSS) is the task to automatically separate a stream of
scanned images into multi-page documents. In a digitization project together
with a German federal archive, we developed a novel approach based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN) combining image and text features to
achieve optimal document separation results. Evaluation shows that our PSS
architecture achieves an accuracy up to 93 % which can be regarded as a new
state-of-the-art for this task.
