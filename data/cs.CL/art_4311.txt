Modeling Task Effects in Human Reading with Neural Attention
Humans read by making a sequence of fixations and saccades. They often skip
words, without apparent detriment to understanding. We offer a novel
explanation for skipping: readers optimize a tradeoff between performing a
language-related task and fixating as few words as possible. We propose a
neural architecture that combines an attention module (deciding whether to skip
words) and a task module (memorizing the input). We show that our model
predicts human skipping behavior, while also modeling reading times well, even
though it skips 40% of the input. A key prediction of our model is that
different reading tasks should result in different skipping behaviors. We
confirm this prediction in an eye-tracking experiment in which participants
answers questions about a text. We are able to capture these experimental
results using the our model, replacing the memorization module with a task
module that performs neural question answering.
