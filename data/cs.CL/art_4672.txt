Toward a Standardized and More Accurate Indonesian Part-of-Speech
  Tagging
Previous work in Indonesian part-of-speech (POS) tagging are hard to compare
as they are not evaluated on a common dataset. Furthermore, in spite of the
success of neural network models for English POS tagging, they are rarely
explored for Indonesian. In this paper, we explored various techniques for
Indonesian POS tagging, including rule-based, CRF, and neural network-based
models. We evaluated our models on the IDN Tagged Corpus. A new
state-of-the-art of 97.47 F1 score is achieved with a recurrent neural network.
To provide a standard for future work, we release the dataset split that we
used publicly.
