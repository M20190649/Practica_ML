Relation Extraction Datasets in the Digital Humanities Domain and their
  Evaluation with Word Embeddings
In this research, we manually create high-quality datasets in the digital
humanities domain for the evaluation of language models, specifically word
embedding models. The first step comprises the creation of unigram and n-gram
datasets for two fantasy novel book series for two task types each, analogy and
doesn't-match. This is followed by the training of models on the two book
series with various popular word embedding model types such as word2vec, GloVe,
fastText, or LexVec. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of word embedding
models for such specific relation extraction tasks in a situation of comparably
small corpus sizes. In the evaluations, we also investigate and analyze
particular aspects such as the impact of corpus term frequencies and task
difficulty on accuracy. The datasets, and the underlying system and word
embedding models are available on github and can be easily extended with new
datasets and tasks, be used to reproduce the presented results, or be
transferred to other domains.
