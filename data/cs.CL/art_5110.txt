Unnamed Entity Recognition of Sense Mentions
We consider the problem of recognizing mentions of human senses in text. Our
contribution is a method for acquiring labeled data, and a learning method that
is trained on this data. Experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed
data labeling approach and our learning model on the task of sense recognition
in text.
