Effective Representation for Easy-First Dependency Parsing
Easy-first parsing relies on subtree re-ranking to build the complete parse
tree. Whereas the intermediate state of parsing processing is represented by
various subtrees, whose internal structural information is the key lead for
later parsing action decisions, we explore a better representation for such
subtrees. In detail, this work introduces a bottom-up subtree encoding method
based on the child-sum tree-LSTM. Starting from an easy-first dependency parser
without other handcraft features, we show that the effective subtree encoder
does promote the parsing process, and can make a greedy search easy-first
parser achieve promising results on benchmark treebanks compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, with the help of the current
pre-training language model, we further improve the state-of-the-art results of
the easy-first approach.
