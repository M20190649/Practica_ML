Neural Network Architecture for Credibility Assessment of Textual Claims
Text articles with false claims, especially news, have recently become
aggravating for the Internet users. These articles are in wide circulation and
readers face difficulty discerning fact from fiction. Previous work on
credibility assessment has focused on factual analysis and linguistic features.
The task's main challenge is the distinction between the features of true and
false articles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Credibility
Outcome (CREDO) which aims at scoring the credibility of an article in an open
domain setting.
  CREDO consists of different modules for capturing various features
responsible for the credibility of an article. These features includes
credibility of the article's source and author, semantic similarity between the
article and related credible articles retrieved from a knowledge base, and
sentiments conveyed by the article. A neural network architecture learns the
contribution of each of these modules to the overall credibility of an article.
Experiments on Snopes dataset reveals that CREDO outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches based on linguistic features.
