Towards NLP with Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks and
  Recurrent Neural Networks for Offensive Language Identification in Social
  Media
This short paper presents the design decisions taken and challenges
encountered in completing SemEval Task 6, which poses the problem of
identifying and categorizing offensive language in tweets. Our proposed
solutions explore Deep Learning techniques, Linear Support Vector
classification and Random Forests to identify offensive tweets, to classify
offenses as targeted or untargeted and eventually to identify the target
subject type.
