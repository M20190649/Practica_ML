Investigating the Effect of Segmentation Methods on Neural Model based
  Sentiment Analysis on Informal Short Texts in Turkish
This work investigates segmentation approaches for sentiment analysis on
informal short texts in Turkish. The two building blocks of the proposed work
are segmentation and deep neural network model. Segmentation focuses on
preprocessing of text with different methods. These methods are grouped in
four: morphological, sub-word, tokenization, and hybrid approaches. We analyzed
several variants for each of these four methods. The second stage focuses on
evaluation of the neural model for sentiment analysis. The performance of each
segmentation method is evaluated under Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model proposed in the literature for sentiment
classification.
