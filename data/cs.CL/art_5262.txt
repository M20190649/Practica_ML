Investigating Antigram Behaviour using Distributional Semantics
Language is an extremely interesting subject to study, each day presenting
new challenges and new topics for research. Words in particular have several
unique characteristics which when explored, prove to be astonishing. Anagrams
and Antigrams are such words possessing these amazing properties. The presented
work is an exploration into generating anagrams from a given word and
determining whether there exists antigram relationships between the pairs of
generated anagrams in light of the Word2Vec distributional semantic similarity
model. The experiments conducted, showed promising results for detecting
antigrams.
