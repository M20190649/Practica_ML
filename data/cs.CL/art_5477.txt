Formality Style Transfer with Hybrid Textual Annotations
Formality style transformation is the task of modifying the formality of a
given sentence without changing its content. Its challenge is the lack of
large-scale sentence-aligned parallel data. In this paper, we propose an
omnivorous model that takes parallel data and formality-classified data jointly
to alleviate the data sparsity issue. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by achieving the state-of-art performance on a
recently proposed benchmark dataset of formality transfer. Furthermore, our
model can be readily adapted to other unsupervised text style transfer tasks
like unsupervised sentiment transfer and achieve competitive results on three
widely recognized benchmarks.
