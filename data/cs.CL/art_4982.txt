On the End-to-End Solution to Mandarin-English Code-switching Speech
  Recognition
Code-switching (CS) refers to a linguistic phenomenon where a speaker uses
different languages in an utterance or between alternating utterances. In this
work, we study end-to-end (E2E) approaches to the Mandarin-English
code-switching speech recognition (CSSR) task. We first examine the
effectiveness of using data augmentation and byte-pair encoding (BPE) subword
units. More importantly, we propose a multitask learning recipe, where a
language identification task is explicitly learned in addition to the E2E
speech recognition task. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient word vocabulary
expansion method for language modeling to alleviate data sparsity issues under
the code-switching scenario. Experimental results on the SEAME data, a
Mandarin-English CS corpus, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.
