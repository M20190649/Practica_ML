Automated Essay Scoring based on Two-Stage Learning
Current state-of-art feature-engineered and end-to-end Automated Essay Score
(AES) methods are proven to be unable to detect adversarial samples, e.g. the
essays composed of permuted sentences and the prompt-irrelevant essays.
Focusing on the problem, we develop a Two-Stage Learning Framework (TSLF) which
integrates the advantages of both feature-engineered and end-to-end AES models.
In experiments, we compare TSLF against a number of strong baselines, and the
results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our models. TSLF
surpasses all the baselines on five-eighths of prompts and achieves new
state-of-the-art average performance when without negative samples. After
adding some adversarial essays to the original datasets, TSLF outperforms the
feature-engineered and end-to-end baselines to a great extent, and shows great
robustness.
