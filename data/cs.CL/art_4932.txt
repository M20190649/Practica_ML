UniMorph 2.0: Universal Morphology
The Universal Morphology UniMorph project is a collaborative effort to
improve how NLP handles complex morphology across the world's languages. The
project releases annotated morphological data using a universal tagset, the
UniMorph schema. Each inflected form is associated with a lemma, which
typically carries its underlying lexical meaning, and a bundle of morphological
features from our schema. Additional supporting data and tools are also
released on a per-language basis when available. UniMorph is based at the
Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, Maryland and is sponsored by the DARPA LORELEI program. This paper
details advances made to the collection, annotation, and dissemination of
project resources since the initial UniMorph release described at LREC 2016.
