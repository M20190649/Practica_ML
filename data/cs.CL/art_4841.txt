Extracting Arguments from Korean Question and Command: An Annotated
  Corpus for Structured Paraphrasing
Intention identification is a core issue in dialog management. However, due
to the non-canonicality of the spoken language, it is difficult to extract the
content automatically from the conversation-style utterances. This is much more
challenging for languages like Korean and Japanese since the agglutination
between morphemes make it difficult for the machines to parse the sentence and
understand the intention. To suggest a guideline for this problem, and to merge
the issue flexibly with the neural paraphrasing systems introduced recently, we
propose a structured annotation scheme for Korean question/commands and the
resulting corpus which are widely applicable to the field of argument mining.
The scheme and dataset are expected to help machines understand the intention
of natural language and grasp the core meaning of conversation-style
instructions.
