Measuring Issue Ownership using Word Embeddings
Sentiment and topic analysis are common methods used for social media
monitoring. Essentially, these methods answers questions such as, "what is
being talked about, regarding X", and "what do people feel, regarding X". In
this paper, we investigate another venue for social media monitoring, namely
issue ownership and agenda setting, which are concepts from political science
that have been used to explain voter choice and electoral outcomes. We argue
that issue alignment and agenda setting can be seen as a kind of semantic
source similarity of the kind "how similar is source A to issue owner P, when
talking about issue X", and as such can be measured using word/document
embedding techniques. We present work in progress towards measuring that kind
of conditioned similarity, and introduce a new notion of similarity for
predictive embeddings. We then test this method by measuring the similarity
between politically aligned media and political parties, conditioned on
bloc-specific issues.
