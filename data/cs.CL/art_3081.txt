Bag-of-Vector Embeddings of Dependency Graphs for Semantic Induction
Vector-space models, from word embeddings to neural network parsers, have
many advantages for NLP. But how to generalise from fixed-length word vectors
to a vector space for arbitrary linguistic structures is still unclear. In this
paper we propose bag-of-vector embeddings of arbitrary linguistic graphs. A
bag-of-vector space is the minimal nonparametric extension of a vector space,
allowing the representation to grow with the size of the graph, but not tying
the representation to any specific tree or graph structure. We propose
efficient training and inference algorithms based on tensor factorisation for
embedding arbitrary graphs in a bag-of-vector space. We demonstrate the
usefulness of this representation by training bag-of-vector embeddings of
dependency graphs and evaluating them on unsupervised semantic induction for
the Semantic Textual Similarity and Natural Language Inference tasks.
