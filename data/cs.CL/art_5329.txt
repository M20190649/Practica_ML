Graph Neural Networks with Generated Parameters for Relation Extraction
Recently, progress has been made towards improving relational reasoning in
machine learning field. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) is
one of the most effective approaches for multi-hop relational reasoning. In
fact, multi-hop relational reasoning is indispensable in many natural language
processing tasks such as relation extraction. In this paper, we propose to
generate the parameters of graph neural networks (GP-GNNs) according to natural
language sentences, which enables GNNs to process relational reasoning on
unstructured text inputs. We verify GP-GNNs in relation extraction from text.
Experimental results on a human-annotated dataset and two distantly supervised
datasets show that our model achieves significant improvements compared to
baselines. We also perform a qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our model
could discover more accurate relations by multi-hop relational reasoning.
