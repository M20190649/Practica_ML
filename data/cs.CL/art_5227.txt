Types, Tokens, and Hapaxes: A New Heap's Law
Heap's Law states that in a large enough text corpus, the number of types as
a function of tokens grows as $N=KM^\beta$ for some free parameters $K,\beta$.
Much has been written about how this result and various generalizations can be
derived from Zipf's Law. Here we derive from first principles a completely
novel expression of the type-token curve and prove its superior accuracy on
real text. This expression naturally generalizes to equally accurate estimates
for counting hapaxes and higher $n$-legomena.
