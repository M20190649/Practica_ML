Assessing Partisan Traits of News Text Attributions
On the topic of journalistic integrity, the current state of accurate,
impartial news reporting has garnered much debate in context to the 2016 US
Presidential Election. In pursuit of computational evaluation of news text, the
statements (attributions) ascribed by media outlets to sources provide a common
category of evidence on which to operate. In this paper, we develop an approach
to compare partisan traits of news text attributions and apply it to
characterize differences in statements ascribed to candidate, Hilary Clinton,
and incumbent President, Donald Trump. In doing so, we present a model trained
on over 600 in-house annotated attributions to identify each candidate with
accuracy > 88%. Finally, we discuss insights from its performance for future
research.
