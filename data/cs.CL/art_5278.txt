Debugging Frame Semantic Role Labeling
We propose a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the performances of
statistical models for frame semantic structure extraction. We report on a
replication study on FrameNet 1.7 data and show that preprocessing toolkits
play a major role in argument identification performances, observing gains
similar in their order of magnitude to those reported by recent models for
frame semantic parsing. We report on the robustness of a recent statistical
classifier for frame semantic parsing to lexical configurations of
predicate-argument structures, relying on an artificially augmented dataset
generated using a rule-based algorithm combining valence pattern matching and
lexical substitution. We prove that syntactic pre-processing plays a major role
in the performances of statistical classifiers to argument identification, and
discuss the core reasons of syntactic mismatch between dependency parsers
output and FrameNet syntactic formalism. Finally, we suggest new leads for
improving statistical models for frame semantic parsing, including joint
syntax-semantic parsing relying on FrameNet syntactic formalism, latent classes
inference via split-and-merge algorithms and neural network architectures
relying on rich input representations of words.
