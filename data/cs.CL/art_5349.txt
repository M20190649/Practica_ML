Understanding Chat Messages for Sticker Recommendation in Hike Messenger
Stickers are popularly used in messaging apps such as Hike to visually
express a nuanced range of thoughts and utterances to convey exaggerated
emotions. However, discovering the right sticker from a large and ever
expanding pool of stickers while chatting can be cumbersome. In this paper, we
describe a system for recommending stickers in real time as the user is typing
based on the context of conversation. We decompose the sticker recommendation
problem into two steps. First, we predict the message that the user is likely
to send in the chat. Second, we substitute the predicted message with an
appropriate sticker. Majority of Hike's messages are in the form of text which
is transliterated from users' native language to the Roman script. This leads
to numerous orthographic variations of the same message and complicates message
prediction. To address this issue, we learn dense representations of chat
messages and use them to cluster the messages that have same meaning. In the
subsequent steps we predict the message cluster instead of the message. Our
model employs a character level convolution network to capture the similar
intents in orthographic variants of chats. We validate our approach using
manually labelled data on two tasks. We also propose a novel hybrid message
prediction model, which can run with low latency on low end phones that have
severe computational limitations.
