Generalizing Procrustes Analysis for Better Bilingual Dictionary
  Induction
Most recent approaches to bilingual dictionary induction find a linear
alignment between the word vector spaces of two languages. We show that
projecting the two languages onto a third, latent space, rather than directly
onto each other, while equivalent in terms of expressivity, makes it easier to
learn approximate alignments. Our modified approach also allows for supporting
languages to be included in the alignment process, to obtain an even better
performance in low resource settings.
