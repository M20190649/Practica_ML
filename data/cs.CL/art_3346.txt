A Corpus for Modeling Word Importance in Spoken Dialogue Transcripts
Motivated by a project to create a system for people who are deaf or
hard-of-hearing that would use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to produce
real-time text captions of spoken English during in-person meetings with
hearing individuals, we have augmented a transcript of the Switchboard
conversational dialogue corpus with an overlay of word-importance annotations,
with a numeric score for each word, to indicate its importance to the meaning
of each dialogue turn. Further, we demonstrate the utility of this corpus by
training an automatic word importance labeling model; our best performing model
has an F-score of 0.60 in an ordinal 6-class word-importance classification
task with an agreement (concordance correlation coefficient) of 0.839 with the
human annotators (agreement score between annotators is 0.89). Finally, we
discuss our intended future applications of this resource, particularly for the
task of evaluating ASR performance, i.e. creating metrics that predict
ASR-output caption text usability for DHH users better thanWord Error Rate
(WER).
