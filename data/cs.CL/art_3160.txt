OhioState at IJCNLP-2017 Task 4: Exploring Neural Architectures for
  Multilingual Customer Feedback Analysis
This paper describes our systems for IJCNLP 2017 Shared Task on Customer
Feedback Analysis. We experimented with simple neural architectures that gave
competitive performance on certain tasks. This includes shallow CNN and
Bi-Directional LSTM architectures with Facebook's Fasttext as a baseline model.
Our best performing model was in the Top 5 systems using the Exact-Accuracy and
Micro-Average-F1 metrics for the Spanish (85.28% for both) and French (70% and
73.17% respectively) task, and outperformed all the other models on comment
(87.28%) and meaningless (51.85%) tags using Micro Average F1 by Tags metric
for the French task.
