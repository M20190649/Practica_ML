How to (Properly) Evaluate Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings: On Strong
  Baselines, Comparative Analyses, and Some Misconceptions
Cross-lingual word embeddings (CLEs) enable multilingual modeling of meaning
and facilitate cross-lingual transfer of NLP models. Despite their ubiquitous
usage in downstream tasks, recent increasingly popular projection-based CLE
models are almost exclusively evaluated on a single task only: bilingual
lexicon induction (BLI). Even BLI evaluations vary greatly, hindering our
ability to correctly interpret performance and properties of different CLE
models. In this work, we make the first step towards a comprehensive evaluation
of cross-lingual word embeddings. We thoroughly evaluate both supervised and
unsupervised CLE models on a large number of language pairs in the BLI task and
three downstream tasks, providing new insights concerning the ability of
cutting-edge CLE models to support cross-lingual NLP. We empirically
demonstrate that the performance of CLE models largely depends on the task at
hand and that optimizing CLE models for BLI can result in deteriorated
downstream performance. We indicate the most robust supervised and unsupervised
CLE models and emphasize the need to reassess existing baselines, which still
display competitive performance across the board. We hope that our work will
catalyze further work on CLE evaluation and model analysis.
