The First Evaluation of Chinese Human-Computer Dialogue Technology
In this paper, we introduce the first evaluation of Chinese human-computer
dialogue technology. We detail the evaluation scheme, tasks, metrics and how to
collect and annotate the data for training, developing and test. The evaluation
includes two tasks, namely user intent classification and online testing of
task-oriented dialogue. To consider the different sources of the data for
training and developing, the first task can also be divided into two sub tasks.
Both the two tasks are coming from the real problems when using the
applications developed by industry. The evaluation data is provided by the
iFLYTEK Corporation. Meanwhile, in this paper, we publish the evaluation
results to present the current performance of the participants in the two tasks
of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology. Moreover, we analyze the
existing problems of human-computer dialogue as well as the evaluation scheme
itself.
