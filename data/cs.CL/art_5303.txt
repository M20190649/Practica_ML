An Arabic Dependency Treebank in the Travel Domain
In this paper we present a dependency treebank of travel domain sentences in
Modern Standard Arabic. The text comes from a translation of the English
equivalent sentences in the Basic Traveling Expressions Corpus. The treebank
dependency representation is in the style of the Columbia Arabic Treebank. The
paper motivates the effort and discusses the construction process and
guidelines. We also present parsing results and discuss the effect of domain
and genre difference on parsing.
