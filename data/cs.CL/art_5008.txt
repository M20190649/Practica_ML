Engaging Image Chat: Modeling Personality in Grounded Dialogue
To achieve the long-term goal of machines being able to engage humans in
conversation, our models should be engaging. We focus on communication grounded
in images, whereby a dialogue is conducted based on a given photo, a setup that
is naturally engaging to humans (Hu et al., 2014). We collect a large dataset
of grounded human-human conversations, where humans are asked to play the role
of a given personality, as the use of personality in conversation has also been
shown to be engaging (Shuster et al., 2018). Our dataset, Image-Chat, consists
of 202k dialogues and 401k utterances over 202k images using 215 possible
personality traits. We then design a set of natural architectures using
state-of-the-art image and text representations, considering various ways to
fuse the components. Automatic metrics and human evaluations show the efficacy
of approach, in particular where our best performing model is preferred over
human conversationalists 47.7% of the time
