Few-Shot Text Classification with Induction Network
Text classification tends to struggle when data is deficient or when it needs
to adapt to unseen classes. In such challenging scenarios, recent studies often
use meta learning to simulate the few-shot task, in which new queries are
compared to a small support set on a sample-wise level. However, this
sample-wise comparison may be severely disturbed by the various expressions in
the same class. Therefore, we should be able to learn a general representation
of each class in the support set and then compare it to new queries. In this
paper, we propose a novel Induction Network to learn such generalized
class-wise representations, innovatively combining the dynamic routing
algorithm with the typical meta learning framework. In this way, our model is
able to induce from particularity to university, which is a more human-like
learning approach. We evaluate our model on a well-studied sentiment
classification dataset (English) and a real-world dialogue intent
classification dataset (Chinese). Experiment results show that, on both
datasets, our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models
and improves the average accuracy by more than 3%, which proves the
effectiveness of class-wise generalization in few-shot text classification.
