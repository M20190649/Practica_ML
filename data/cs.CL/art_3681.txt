Direct Network Transfer: Transfer Learning of Sentence Embeddings for
  Semantic Similarity
Sentence encoders, which produce sentence embeddings using neural networks,
are typically evaluated by how well they transfer to downstream tasks. This
includes semantic similarity, an important task in natural language
understanding. Although there has been much work dedicated to building sentence
encoders, the accompanying transfer learning techniques have received
relatively little attention. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning
setting specialized for semantic similarity, which we refer to as direct
network transfer. Through experiments on several standard text similarity
datasets, we show that applying direct network transfer to existing encoders
can lead to state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we compare several
approaches to transfer sentence encoders to semantic similarity tasks, showing
that the choice of transfer learning setting greatly affects the performance in
many cases, and differs by encoder and dataset.
