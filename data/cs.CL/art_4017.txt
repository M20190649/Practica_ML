SemEval 2019 Shared Task: Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing with UCCA -
  Call for Participation
We announce a shared task on UCCA parsing in English, German and French, and
call for participants to submit their systems. UCCA is a cross-linguistically
applicable framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive
typological work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for
existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG
structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to
complex semantic units. Given the success of recent semantic parsing shared
tasks (on SDP and AMR), we expect the task to have a significant contribution
to the advancement of UCCA parsing in particular, and semantic parsing in
general. Furthermore, existing applications for semantic evaluation that are
based on UCCA will greatly benefit from better automatic methods for UCCA
parsing. The competition website is
