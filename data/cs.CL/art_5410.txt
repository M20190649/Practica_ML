CN-Probase: A Data-driven Approach for Large-scale Chinese Taxonomy
  Construction
Taxonomies play an important role in machine intelligence. However, most
well-known taxonomies are in English, and non-English taxonomies, especially
Chinese ones, are still very rare. In this paper, we focus on automatic Chinese
taxonomy construction and propose an effective generation and verification
framework to build a large-scale and high-quality Chinese taxonomy. In the
generation module, we extract isA relations from multiple sources of Chinese
encyclopedia, which ensures the coverage. To further improve the precision of
taxonomy, we apply three heuristic approaches in verification module. As a
result, we construct the largest Chinese taxonomy with high precision about 95%
called CN-Probase. Our taxonomy has been deployed on Aliyun, with over 82
million API calls in six months.
