Treating Keywords as Outliers: A Keyphrase Extraction Approach
We propose a novel unsupervised keyphrase extraction approach that filters
candidate keywords using outlier detection. It starts by training word
embeddings on the target document to capture semantic regularities among the
words. It then uses the minimum covariance determinant estimator to model the
distribution of non-keyphrase word vectors, under the assumption that these
vectors come from the same distribution, indicative of their irrelevance to the
semantics expressed by the dimensions of the learned vector representation.
Candidate keyphrases only consist of words that are detected as outliers of
this dominant distribution. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art and recent unsupervised keyphrase extraction
methods.
