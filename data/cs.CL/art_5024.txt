Elastic CRFs for Open-ontology Slot Filling
Slot filling is a crucial component in task-oriented dialog systems, which is
to parse (user) utterances into semantic concepts called slots. An ontology is
defined by the collection of slots and the values that each slot can take. The
widely-used practice of treating slot filling as a sequence labeling task
suffers from two drawbacks. First, the ontology is usually pre-defined and
fixed. Most current methods are unable to predict new labels for unseen slots.
Second, the one-hot encoding of slot labels ignores the semantic meanings and
relations for slots, which are implicit in their natural language descriptions.
These observations motivate us to propose a novel model called elastic
conditional random field (eCRF), for open-ontology slot filling. eCRFs can
leverage the neural features of both the utterance and the slot descriptions,
and are able to model the interactions between different slots. Experimental
results show that eCRFs outperforms existing models on both the in-domain and
the cross-doamin tasks, especially in predictions of unseen slots and values.
