Polylingual Wordnet
Princeton WordNet is one of the most important resources for natural language
processing, but is only available for English. While it has been translated
using the expand approach to many other languages, this is an expensive manual
process. Therefore it would be beneficial to have a high-quality automatic
translation approach that would support NLP techniques, which rely on WordNet
in new languages. The translation of wordnets is fundamentally complex because
of the need to translate all senses of a word including low frequency senses,
which is very challenging for current machine translation approaches. For this
reason we leverage existing translations of WordNet in other languages to
identify contextual information for wordnet senses from a large set of generic
parallel corpora. We evaluate our approach using 10 translated wordnets for
European languages. Our experiment shows a significant improvement over
translation without any contextual information. Furthermore, we evaluate how
the choice of pivot languages affects performance of multilingual word sense
disambiguation.
