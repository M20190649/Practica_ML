Formal models of Structure Building in Music, Language and Animal Songs
Human language, music and a variety of animal vocalisations constitute ways
of sonic communication that exhibit remarkable structural complexity. While the
complexities of language and possible parallels in animal communication have
been discussed intensively, reflections on the complexity of music and animal
song, and their comparisons are underrepresented. In some ways, music and
animal songs are more comparable to each other than to language, as
propositional semantics cannot be used as as indicator of communicative success
or well-formedness, and notions of grammaticality are less easily defined. This
review brings together accounts of the principles of structure building in
language, music and animal song, relating them to the corresponding models in
formal language theory, with a special focus on evaluating the benefits of
using the Chomsky hierarchy (CH). We further discuss common misunderstandings
and shortcomings concerning the CH, as well as extensions or augmentations of
it that address some of these issues, and suggest ways to move beyond.
