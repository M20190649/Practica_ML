Neural machine translation framework based cross-lingual document vector
  with distance constraint training
A universal cross-lingual representation of documents is very important for
many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present a document
vectorization method which can effectively create document vectors via
self-attention mechanism using a neural machine translation (NMT) framework.
The model used by our method can be trained with parallel corpora that are
unrelated to the task at hand. During testing, our method will take a
monolingual document and convert it into a "Neural machine Translation
framework based crosslingual Document Vector with distance constraint training"
(cNTDV). cNTDV is a follow-up study from our previous research on the neural
machine translation framework based document vector. The cNTDV can produce the
document vector from a forward-pass of the encoder with fast speed. Moreover,
it is trained with a distance constraint, so that the document vector obtained
from different language pair is always consistent with each other. In a
cross-lingual document classification task, our cNTDV embeddings surpass the
published state-of-the-art performance in the English-to-German classification
test, and, to our best knowledge, it also achieves the second best performance
in German-to-English classification test. Comparing to our previous research,
it does not need a translator in the testing process, which makes the model
faster and more convenient.
