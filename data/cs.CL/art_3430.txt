OhioState at SemEval-2018 Task 7: Exploiting Data Augmentation for
  Relation Classification in Scientific Papers using Piecewise Convolutional
  Neural Networks
We describe our system for SemEval-2018 Shared Task on Semantic Relation
Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers where we focus on the
Classification task. Our simple piecewise convolution neural encoder performs
decently in an end to end manner. A simple inter-task data augmentation
signifi- cantly boosts the performance of the model. Our best-performing
systems stood 8th out of 20 teams on the classification task on noisy data and
12th out of 28 teams on the classification task on clean data.
