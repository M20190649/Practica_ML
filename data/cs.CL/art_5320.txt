tax2vec: Constructing Interpretable Features from Taxonomies for Short
  Text Classification
The use of background knowledge remains largely unexploited in many text
classification tasks. In this work, we explore word taxonomies as means for
constructing new semantic features, which may improve the performance and
robustness of the learned classifiers. We propose tax2vec, a parallel algorithm
for constructing taxonomy based features, and demonstrate its use on six
short-text classification problems, including gender, age and personality type
prediction, drug effectiveness and side effect prediction, and news topic
prediction. The experimental results indicate that the interpretable features
constructed using tax2vec can notably improve the performance of classifiers;
the constructed features, in combination with fast, linear classifiers tested
against strong baselines, such as hierarchical attention neural networks,
achieved comparable or better classification results on short documents.
Further, tax2vec can also serve for extraction of corpus-specific keywords.
Finally, we investigated the semantic space of potential features where we
observe a similarity with the well known Zipf's law.
