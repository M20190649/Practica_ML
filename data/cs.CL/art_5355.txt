Table2answer: Read the database and answer without SQL
Semantic parsing is the task of mapping natural language to logic form. In
question answering, semantic parsing can be used to map the question to logic
form and execute the logic form to get the answer. One key problem for semantic
parsing is the hard label work. We study this problem in another way: we do not
use the logic form any more. Instead we only use the schema and answer info. We
think that the logic form step can be injected into the deep model. The reason
why we think removing the logic form step is possible is that human can do the
task without explicit logic form. We use BERT-based model and do the experiment
in the WikiSQL dataset, which is a large natural language to SQL dataset. Our
experimental evaluations that show that our model can achieves the baseline
results in WikiSQL dataset.
