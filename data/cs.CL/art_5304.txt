Divide and Generate: Neural Generation of Complex Sentences
We propose a task to generate a complex sentence from a simple sentence in
order to amplify various kinds of responses in the database. We first divide a
complex sentence into a main clause and a subordinate clause to learn a
generator model of modifiers, and then use the model to generate a modifier
clause to create a complex sentence from a simple sentence. We present an
automatic evaluation metric to estimate the quality of the models and show that
a pipeline model outperforms an end-to-end model.
