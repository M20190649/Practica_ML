Addressing Objects and Their Relations: The Conversational Entity
  Dialogue Model
Statistical spoken dialogue systems usually rely on a single- or multi-domain
dialogue model that is restricted in its capabilities of modelling complex
dialogue structures, e.g., relations. In this work, we propose a novel dialogue
model that is centred around entities and is able to model relations as well as
multiple entities of the same type. We demonstrate in a prototype
implementation benefits of relation modelling on the dialogue level and show
that a trained policy using these relations outperforms the multi-domain
baseline. Furthermore, we show that by modelling the relations on the dialogue
level, the system is capable of processing relations present in the user input
and even learns to address them in the system response.
