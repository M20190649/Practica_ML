A Tweet Dataset Annotated for Named Entity Recognition and Stance
  Detection
Annotated datasets in different domains are critical for many supervised
learning-based solutions to related problems and for the evaluation of the
proposed solutions. Topics in natural language processing (NLP) similarly
require annotated datasets to be used for such purposes. In this paper, we
target at two NLP problems, named entity recognition and stance detection, and
present the details of a tweet dataset in Turkish annotated for named entity
and stance information. Within the course of the current study, both the named
entity and stance annotations of the included tweets are made publicly
available, although previously the dataset has been publicly shared with stance
annotations only. We believe that this dataset will be useful for uncovering
the possible relationships between named entity recognition and stance
detection in tweets.
