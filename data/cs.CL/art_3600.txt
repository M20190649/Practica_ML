English Out-of-Vocabulary Lexical Evaluation Task
Unlike previous unknown nouns tagging task, this is the first attempt to
focus on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) lexical evaluation tasks that do not require
any prior knowledge. The OOV words are words that only appear in test samples.
The goal of tasks is to provide solutions for OOV lexical classification and
prediction. The tasks require annotators to conclude the attributes of the OOV
words based on their related contexts. Then, we utilize unsupervised word
embedding methods such as Word2Vec and Word2GM to perform the baseline
experiments on the categorical classification task and OOV words attribute
prediction tasks.
