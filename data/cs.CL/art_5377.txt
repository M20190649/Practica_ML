Aspect-Sentiment Embeddings for Company Profiling and Employee Opinion
  Mining
With the multitude of companies and organizations abound today, ranking them
and choosing one out of the many is a difficult and cumbersome task. Although
there are many available metrics that rank companies, there is an inherent need
for a generalized metric that takes into account the different aspects that
constitute employee opinions of the companies. In this work, we aim to overcome
the aforementioned problem by generating aspect-sentiment based embedding for
the companies by looking into reliable employee reviews of them. We created a
comprehensive dataset of company reviews from the famous website Glassdoor.com
and employed a novel ensemble approach to perform aspect-level sentiment
analysis. Although a relevant amount of work has been done on reviews centered
on subjects like movies, music, etc., this work is the first of its kind. We
also provide several insights from the collated embeddings, thus helping users
gain a better understanding of their options as well as select companies using
customized preferences.
