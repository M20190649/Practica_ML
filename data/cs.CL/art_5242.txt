Team Papelo: Transformer Networks at FEVER
We develop a system for the FEVER fact extraction and verification challenge
that uses a high precision entailment classifier based on transformer networks
pretrained with language modeling, to classify a broad set of potential
evidence. The precision of the entailment classifier allows us to enhance
recall by considering every statement from several articles to decide upon each
claim. We include not only the articles best matching the claim text by TFIDF
score, but read additional articles whose titles match named entities and
capitalized expressions occurring in the claim text. The entailment module
evaluates potential evidence one statement at a time, together with the title
of the page the evidence came from (providing a hint about possible pronoun
antecedents). In preliminary evaluation, the system achieves .5736 FEVER score,
.6108 label accuracy, and .6485 evidence F1 on the FEVER shared task test set.
