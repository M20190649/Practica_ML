Implementation of an Automatic Sign Language Lexical Annotation
  Framework based on Propositional Dynamic Logic
In this paper, we present the implementation of an automatic Sign Language
(SL) sign annotation framework based on a formal logic, the Propositional
Dynamic Logic (PDL). Our system relies heavily on the use of a specific variant
of PDL, the Propositional Dynamic Logic for Sign Language (PDLSL), which lets
us describe SL signs as formulae and corpora videos as labeled transition
systems (LTSs). Here, we intend to show how a generic annotation system can be
constructed upon these underlying theoretical principles, regardless of the
tracking technologies available or the input format of corpora. With this in
mind, we generated a development framework that adapts the system to specific
use cases. Furthermore, we present some results obtained by our application
when adapted to one distinct case, 2D corpora analysis with pre-processed
tracking information. We also present some insights on how such a technology
can be used to analyze 3D real-time data, captured with a depth device.
