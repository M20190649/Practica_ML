Toward Fast and Accurate Neural Chinese Word Segmentation with
  Multi-Criteria Learning
The ambiguous annotation criteria bring into the divergence of Chinese Word
Segmentation (CWS) datasets with various granularities. Multi-criteria learning
leverage the annotation style of individual datasets and mine their common
basic knowledge. In this paper, we proposed a domain adaptive segmenter to
capture diverse criteria of datasets. Our model is based on Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is responsible for
introducing external knowledge. We also optimize its computational efficiency
via model pruning, quantization, and compiler optimization. Experiments show
that our segmenter outperforms the previous results on 10 CWS datasets and is
faster than the previous state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF model.
