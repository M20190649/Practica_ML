A Short Survey on Sense-Annotated Corpora
Large sense-annotated datasets are increasingly necessary for training deep
supervised systems in word sense disambiguation. However, gathering
high-quality sense-annotated data for as many instances as possible is a
laborious and expensive task. This has led to the proliferation of automatic
and semi-automatic methods for overcoming the so-called knowledge-acquisition
bottleneck. In this short survey we present an overview of currently available
sense-annotated corpora, both manually and (semi)automatically constructed, for
diverse languages and lexical resources (i.e. WordNet, Wikipedia, BabelNet).
General statistics and specific features of each sense-annotated dataset are
also provided.
