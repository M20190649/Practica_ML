Speaker Role Contextual Modeling for Language Understanding and Dialogue
  Policy Learning
Language understanding (LU) and dialogue policy learning are two essential
components in conversational systems. Human-human dialogues are not
well-controlled and often random and unpredictable due to their own goals and
speaking habits. This paper proposes a role-based contextual model to consider
different speaker roles independently based on the various speaking patterns in
the multi-turn dialogues. The experiments on the benchmark dataset show that
the proposed role-based model successfully learns role-specific behavioral
patterns for contextual encoding and then significantly improves language
understanding and dialogue policy learning tasks.
