Author Profiling for Hate Speech Detection
The rapid growth of social media in recent years has fed into some highly
undesirable phenomena such as proliferation of abusive and offensive language
on the Internet. Previous research suggests that such hateful content tends to
come from users who share a set of common stereotypes and form communities
around them. The current state-of-the-art approaches to hate speech detection
are oblivious to user and community information and rely entirely on textual
(i.e., lexical and semantic) cues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to this problem that incorporates community-based profiling features of Twitter
users. Experimenting with a dataset of 16k tweets, we show that our methods
significantly outperform the current state of the art in hate speech detection.
Further, we conduct a qualitative analysis of model characteristics. We release
our code, pre-trained models and all the resources used in the public domain.
