Language and Dialect Identification of Cuneiform Texts
This article introduces a corpus of cuneiform texts from which the dataset
for the use of the Cuneiform Language Identification (CLI) 2019 shared task was
derived as well as some preliminary language identification experiments
conducted using that corpus. We also describe the CLI dataset and how it was
derived from the corpus. In addition, we provide some baseline language
identification results using the CLI dataset. To the best of our knowledge, the
experiments detailed here are the first time automatic language identification
methods have been used on cuneiform data.
