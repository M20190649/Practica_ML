Text Mining Customer Reviews For Aspect-based Restaurant Rating
This study applies text mining to analyze customer reviews and automatically
assign a collective restaurant star rating based on five predetermined aspects:
ambiance, cost, food, hygiene, and service. The application provides a web and
mobile crowd sourcing platform where users share dining experiences and get
insights about the strengths and weaknesses of a restaurant through user
contributed feedback. Text reviews are tokenized into sentences. Noun-adjective
pairs are extracted from each sentence using Stanford Core NLP library and are
associated to aspects based on the bag of associated words fed into the system.
The sentiment weight of the adjectives is determined through AFINN library. An
overall restaurant star rating is computed based on the individual aspect
rating. Further, a word cloud is generated to provide visual display of the
most frequently occurring terms in the reviews. The more feedbacks are added
the more reflective the sentiment score to the restaurants' performance.
