A Portuguese Native Language Identification Dataset
In this paper we present NLI-PT, the first Portuguese dataset compiled for
Native Language Identification (NLI), the task of identifying an author's first
language based on their second language writing. The dataset includes 1,868
student essays written by learners of European Portuguese, native speakers of
the following L1s: Chinese, English, Spanish, German, Russian, French,
Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Tetum, Arabic, Polish, Korean, Romanian, and Swedish.
NLI-PT includes the original student text and four different types of
annotation: POS, fine-grained POS, constituency parses, and dependency parses.
NLI-PT can be used not only in NLI but also in research on several topics in
the field of Second Language Acquisition and educational NLP. We discuss
possible applications of this dataset and present the results obtained for the
first lexical baseline system for Portuguese NLI.
