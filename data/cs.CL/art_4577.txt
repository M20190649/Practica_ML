What do RNN Language Models Learn about Filler-Gap Dependencies?
RNN language models have achieved state-of-the-art perplexity results and
have proven useful in a suite of NLP tasks, but it is as yet unclear what
syntactic generalizations they learn. Here we investigate whether
state-of-the-art RNN language models represent long-distance filler-gap
dependencies and constraints on them. Examining RNN behavior on experimentally
controlled sentences designed to expose filler-gap dependencies, we show that
RNNs can represent the relationship in multiple syntactic positions and over
large spans of text. Furthermore, we show that RNNs learn a subset of the known
restrictions on filler-gap dependencies, known as island constraints: RNNs show
evidence for wh-islands, adjunct islands, and complex NP islands. These studies
demonstrates that state-of-the-art RNN models are able to learn and generalize
about empty syntactic positions.
