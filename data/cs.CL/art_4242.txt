JeSemE: A Website for Exploring Diachronic Changes in Word Meaning and
  Emotion
We here introduce a substantially extended version of JeSemE, a website for
visually exploring computationally derived time-variant information on word
meaning and lexical emotion assembled from five large diachronic text corpora.
JeSemE is intended as an interactive tool for scholars in the (digital)
humanities who are mostly limited to consulting manually compiled dictionaries
for such information, if available at all. JeSemE uniquely combines
state-of-the-art distributional semantics with a nuanced model of human
emotions, two information streams we deem beneficial for a data-driven
interpretation of texts in the humanities.
