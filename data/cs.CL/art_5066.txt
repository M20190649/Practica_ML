Speech Intention Understanding in a Head-final Language: A
  Disambiguation Utilizing Intonation-dependency
For a large portion of real-life utterances, the intention cannot be solely
decided by either their semantic or syntactic characteristics. Although not all
the sociolinguistic and pragmatic information can be digitized, at least
phonetic features are indispensable in understanding the spoken language.
Especially in head-final languages such as Korean, sentence-final prosody has
great importance in identifying the speaker's intention. This paper suggests a
system which identifies the inherent intention of a spoken utterance given its
transcript, in some cases using auxiliary acoustic features. The main point
here is a separate distinction for cases where discrimination of intention
requires an acoustic cue. Thus, the proposed classification system decides
whether the given utterance is a fragment, statement, question, command, or a
rhetorical question/command, utilizing the intonation-dependency coming from
the head-finality. Based on an intuitive understanding of the Korean language
that is engaged in the data annotation, we construct a network which identifies
the intention of a speech, and validate its utility with the test sentences.
The system, if combined with up-to-date speech recognizers, is expected to be
flexibly inserted into various language understanding modules.
