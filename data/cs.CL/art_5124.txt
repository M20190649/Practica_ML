Multi Task Deep Morphological Analyzer: Context Aware Joint
  Morphological Tagging and Lemma Prediction
The ambiguities introduced by the recombination of morphemes constructing
several possible inflections for a word makes the prediction of syntactic
traits in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) a notoriously complicated task.
We propose the Multi Task Deep Morphological analyzer (MT-DMA), a
character-level neural morphological analyzer based on multitask learning of
word-level tag markers for Hindi and Urdu. MT-DMA predicts a set of six
morphological tags for words of Indo-Aryan languages: Parts-of-speech (POS),
Gender (G), Number (N), Person (P), Case (C), Tense-Aspect-Modality (TAM)
marker as well as the Lemma (L) by jointly learning all these in one trainable
framework. We show the effectiveness of training of such deep neural networks
by the simultaneous optimization of multiple loss functions and sharing of
initial parameters for context-aware morphological analysis. Exploiting
character-level features in phonological space optimized for each tag using
multi-objective genetic algorithm, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art
accuracy score upon all seven of the tasks for both the languages. MT-DMA is
publicly accessible: code, models and data are available at
