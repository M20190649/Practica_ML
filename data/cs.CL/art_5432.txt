Open Information Extraction from Question-Answer Pairs
Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) extracts meaningful structured tuples
from free-form text. Most previous work on OpenIE considers extracting data
from one sentence at a time. We describe NeurON, a system for extracting tuples
from question-answer pairs. Since real questions and answers often contain
precisely the information that users care about, such information is
particularly desirable to extend a knowledge base with.
  NeurON addresses several challenges. First, an answer text is often hard to
understand without knowing the question, and second, relevant information can
span multiple sentences. To address these, NeurON formulates extraction as a
multi-source sequence-to-sequence learning task, wherein it combines
distributed representations of a question and an answer to generate knowledge
facts. We describe experiments on two real-world datasets that demonstrate that
NeurON can find a significant number of new and interesting facts to extend a
knowledge base compared to state-of-the-art OpenIE methods.
