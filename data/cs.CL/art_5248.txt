From Plots to Endings: A Reinforced Pointer Generator for Story Ending
  Generation
We introduce a new task named Story Ending Generation (SEG), whic-h aims at
generating a coherent story ending from a sequence of story plot. Wepropose a
framework consisting of a Generator and a Reward Manager for thistask. The
Generator follows the pointer-generator network with coverage mech-anism to
deal with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and repetitive words. Moreover, amixed loss
method is introduced to enable the Generator to produce story endingsof high
semantic relevance with story plots. In the Reward Manager, the rewardis
computed to fine-tune the Generator with policy-gradient reinforcement
learn-ing (PGRL). We conduct experiments on the recently-introduced
ROCStoriesCorpus. We evaluate our model in both automatic evaluation and human
evalua-tion. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the
sequence-to-sequencebaseline model by 15.75% and 13.57% in terms of CIDEr and
consistency scorerespectively.
