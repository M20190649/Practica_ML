The Fast and the Flexible: training neural networks to learn to follow
  instructions from small data
Learning to follow human instructions is a long-pursued goal in artificial
intelligence. The task becomes particularly challenging if no prior knowledge
of the employed language is assumed while relying only on a handful of examples
to learn from. Work in the past has relied on hand-coded components or manually
engineered features to provide strong inductive biases that make learning in
such situations possible. In contrast, here we seek to establish whether this
knowledge can be acquired automatically by a neural network system through a
two phase training procedure: A (slow) offline learning stage where the network
learns about the general structure of the task and a (fast) online adaptation
phase where the network learns the language of a new given speaker. Controlled
experiments show that when the network is exposed to familiar instructions but
containing novel words, the model adapts very efficiently to the new
vocabulary. Moreover, even for human speakers whose language usage can depart
significantly from our artificial training language, our network can still make
use of its automatically acquired inductive bias to learn to follow
instructions more effectively.
