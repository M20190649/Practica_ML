Online Learning for Effort Reduction in Interactive Neural Machine
  Translation
Neural machine translation systems require large amounts of training data and
resources. Even with this, the quality of the translations may be insufficient
for some users or domains. In such cases, the output of the system must be
revised by a human agent. This can be done in a post-editing stage or following
an interactive machine translation protocol.
  We explore the incremental update of neural machine translation systems
during the post-editing or interactive translation processes. Such
modifications aim to incorporate the new knowledge, from the edited sentences,
into the translation system. Updates to the model are performed on-the-fly, as
sentences are corrected, via online learning techniques. In addition, we
implement a novel interactive, adaptive system, able to react to
single-character interactions. This system greatly reduces the human effort
required for obtaining high-quality translations.
  In order to stress our proposals, we conduct exhaustive experiments varying
the amount and type of data available for training. Results show that online
learning effectively achieves the objective of reducing the human effort
required during the post-editing or the interactive machine translation stages.
Moreover, these adaptive systems also perform well in scenarios with scarce
resources. We show that a neural machine translation system can be rapidly
adapted to a specific domain, exclusively by means of online learning
techniques.
