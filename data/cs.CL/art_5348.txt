Extending a model for ontology-based Arabic-English machine translation
The acceleration in telecommunication needs leads to many groups of research,
especially in communication facilitating and Machine Translation fields. While
people contact with others having different languages and cultures, they need
to have instant translations. However, the available instant translators are
still providing somewhat bad Arabic-English Translations, for instance when
translating books or articles, the meaning is not totally accurate. Therefore,
using the semantic web techniques to deal with the homographs and homonyms
semantically, the aim of this research is to extend a model for the
ontology-based Arabic-English Machine Translation, named NAN, which simulate
the human way in translation. The experimental results show that NAN
translation is approximately more similar to the Human Translation than the
other instant translators. The resulted translation will help getting the
translated texts in the target language somewhat correctly and semantically
more similar to human translations for the Non-Arabic Natives and the
Non-English natives.
