A Discourse-Level Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction
  Dataset for Chinese Literature Text
Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction for Chinese literature text
is regarded as the highly difficult problem, partially because of the lack of
tagging sets. In this paper, we build a discourse-level dataset from hundreds
of Chinese literature articles for improving this task. To build a high quality
dataset, we propose two tagging methods to solve the problem of data
inconsistency, including a heuristic tagging method and a machine auxiliary
tagging method. Based on this corpus, we also introduce several widely used
models to conduct experiments. Experimental results not only show the
usefulness of the proposed dataset, but also provide baselines for further
research. The dataset is available at
