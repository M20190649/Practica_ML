Interactive Matching Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection in
  Retrieval-Based Chatbots
In this paper, we propose an interactive matching network (IMN) to enhance
the representations of contexts and responses at both the word level and
sentence level for the multi-turn response selection task. First, IMN
constructs word representations from three aspects to address the challenge of
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Second, an attentive hierarchical recurrent
encoder (AHRE), which is capable of encoding sentences hierarchically and
generating more descriptive representations by aggregating with an attention
mechanism, is designed. Finally, the bidirectional interactions between whole
multi-turn contexts and response candidates are calculated to derive the
matching information between them. Experiments on four public datasets show
that IMN significantly outperforms the baseline models by large margins on all
metrics, achieving new state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating
compatibility across domains for multi-turn response selection.
