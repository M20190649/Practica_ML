Development of a classifiers/quantifiers dictionary towards
  French-Japanese MT
Although classifiers/quantifiers (CQs) expressions appear frequently in
everyday communications or written documents, they are described neither in
classical bilingual paper dictionaries , nor in machine-readable dictionaries.
The paper describes a CQs dictionary, edited from the corpus we have annotated,
and its usage in the framework of French-Japanese machine translation (MT). CQs
treatment in MT often causes problems of lexical ambiguity, polylexical phrase
recognition difficulties in analysis and doubtful output in
transfer-generation, in particular for distant languages pairs like French and
Japanese. Our basic treatment of CQs is to annotate the corpus by UNL-UWs
(Universal Networking Language-Universal words) 1 , and then to produce a
bilingual or multilingual dictionary of CQs, based on synonymy through identity
of UWs.
