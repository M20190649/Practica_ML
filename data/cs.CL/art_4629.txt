Neural DrugNet
In this paper, we describe the system submitted for the shared task on Social
Media Mining for Health Applications by the team Light. Previous works
demonstrate that LSTMs have achieved remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks. We deploy an ensemble of two LSTM models. The first one is a
pretrained language model appended with a classifier and takes words as input,
while the second one is a LSTM model with an attention unit over it which takes
character tri-gram as input. We call the ensemble of these two models:
Neural-DrugNet. Our system ranks 2nd in the second shared task: Automatic
classification of posts describing medication intake.
