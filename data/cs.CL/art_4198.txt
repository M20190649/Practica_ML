Modeling Language Variation and Universals: A Survey on Typological
  Linguistics for Natural Language Processing
Linguistic typology aims to capture structural and semantic variation across
the world's languages. A large-scale typology could provide excellent guidance
for multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly for languages
that suffer from the lack of human labeled resources. We present an extensive
literature survey on the use of typological information in the development of
NLP techniques. Our survey demonstrates that to date, the use of information in
existing typological databases has resulted in consistent but modest
improvements in system performance. We show that this is due to both intrinsic
limitations of databases (in terms of coverage and feature granularity) and
under-employment of the typological features included in them. We advocate for
a new approach that adapts the broad and discrete nature of typological
categories to the contextual and continuous nature of machine learning
algorithms used in contemporary NLP. In particular, we suggest that such
approach could be facilitated by recent developments in data-driven induction
of typological knowledge.
