Combining Thesaurus Knowledge and Probabilistic Topic Models
In this paper we present the approach of introducing thesaurus knowledge into
probabilistic topic models. The main idea of the approach is based on the
assumption that the frequencies of semantically related words and phrases,
which are met in the same texts, should be enhanced: this action leads to their
larger contribution into topics found in these texts. We have conducted
experiments with several thesauri and found that for improving topic models, it
is useful to utilize domain-specific knowledge. If a general thesaurus, such as
WordNet, is used, the thesaurus-based improvement of topic models can be
achieved with excluding hyponymy relations in combined topic models.
