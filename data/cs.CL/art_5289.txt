Automatic Parallel Corpus Creation for Hindi-English News Translation
  Task
The parallel corpus for multilingual NLP tasks, deep learning applications
like Statistical Machine Translation Systems is very important. The parallel
corpus of Hindi-English language pair available for news translation task till
date is of very limited size as per the requirement of the systems are
concerned. In this work we have developed an automatic parallel corpus
generation system prototype, which creates Hindi-English parallel corpus for
news translation task. Further to verify the quality of generated parallel
corpus we have experimented by taking various performance metrics and the
results are quite interesting.
