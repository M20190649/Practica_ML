The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) Shared Task
We present the results of the first Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER)
Shared Task. The task challenged participants to classify whether human-written
factoid claims could be Supported or Refuted using evidence retrieved from
Wikipedia. We received entries from 23 competing teams, 19 of which scored
higher than the previously published baseline. The best performing system
achieved a FEVER score of 64.21%. In this paper, we present the results of the
shared task and a summary of the systems, highlighting commonalities and
innovations among participating systems.
