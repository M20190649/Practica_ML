Text Analysis in Adversarial Settings: Does Deception Leave a Stylistic
  Trace?
Textual deception constitutes a major problem for online security. Many
studies have argued that deceptiveness leaves traces in writing style, which
could be detected using text classification techniques. By conducting an
extensive literature review of existing empirical work, we demonstrate that
while certain linguistic features have been indicative of deception in certain
corpora, they fail to generalize across divergent semantic domains. We suggest
that deceptiveness as such leaves no content-invariant stylistic trace, and
textual similarity measures provide superior means of classifying texts as
potentially deceptive. Additionally, we discuss forms of deception beyond
semantic content, focusing on hiding author identity by writing style
obfuscation. Surveying the literature on both author identification and
obfuscation techniques, we conclude that current style transformation methods
fail to achieve reliable obfuscation while simultaneously ensuring semantic
faithfulness to the original text. We propose that future work in style
transformation should pay particular attention to disallowing semantically
drastic changes.
