Automatic assessment of spoken language proficiency of non-native
  children
This paper describes technology developed to automatically grade Italian
students (ages 9-16) on their English and German spoken language proficiency.
The students' spoken answers are first transcribed by an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system and then scored using a feedforward neural network
(NN) that processes features extracted from the automatic transcriptions.
In-domain acoustic models, employing deep neural networks (DNNs), are derived
by adapting the parameters of an original out of domain DNN.
