Automatic Transferring between Ancient Chinese and Contemporary Chinese
During the long time of development, Chinese language has evolved a great
deal. Native speakers now have difficulty in reading sentences written in
ancient Chinese. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised algorithm that
constructs sentence-aligned ancient-contemporary pairs out of the abundant
passage-aligned corpus. With this method, we build a large parallel corpus. We
propose to apply the sequence to sequence model to automatically transfer
between ancient and contemporary Chinese sentences. Experiments show that both
our alignment and transfer method can produce very good result except for some
circumstances that even human translators can make mistakes without background
knowledge.
