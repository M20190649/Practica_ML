From Knowledge Map to Mind Map: Artificial Imagination
Imagination is one of the most important factors which makes an artistic
painting unique and impressive. With the rapid development of Artificial
Intelligence, more and more researchers try to create painting with AI
technology automatically. However, lacking of imagination is still a main
problem for AI painting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inject
rich imagination into a special painting art Mind Map creation. We firstly
consider lexical and phonological similarities of seed word, then learn and
inherit original painting style of the author, and finally apply Dadaism and
impossibility of improvisation principles into painting process. We also design
several metrics for imagination evaluation. Experimental results show that our
proposed method can increase imagination of painting and also improve its
overall quality.
