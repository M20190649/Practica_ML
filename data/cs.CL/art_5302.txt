OpenHowNet: An Open Sememe-based Lexical Knowledge Base
In this paper, we present an open sememe-based lexical knowledge base
OpenHowNet. Based on well-known HowNet, OpenHowNet comprises three components:
core data which is composed of more than 100 thousand senses annotated with
sememes, OpenHowNet Web which gives a brief introduction to OpenHowNet as well
as provides online exhibition of OpenHowNet information, and OpenHowNet API
which includes several useful APIs such as accessing OpenHowNet core data and
drawing sememe tree structures of senses. In the main text, we first give some
backgrounds including definition of sememe and details of HowNet. And then we
introduce some previous HowNet and sememe-based research works. Last but not
least, we detail the constituents of OpenHowNet and their basic features and
functionalities. Additionally, we briefly make a summary and list some future
works.
