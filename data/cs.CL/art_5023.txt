Challenges in detecting evolutionary forces in language change using
  diachronic corpora
Newberry et al. (Detecting evolutionary forces in language change, Nature
551, 2017) tackle an important but difficult problem in linguistics, the
testing of selective theories of language change against a null model of drift.
Having applied a test from population genetics (the Frequency Increment Test)
to a number of relevant examples, they suggest stochasticity has a previously
under-appreciated role in language evolution. We replicate their results and
find that while the overall observation holds, results produced by this
approach on individual time series are highly sensitive to how the corpus is
organized into temporal segments (binning). Furthermore, we use a large set of
simulations in conjunction with binning to systematically explore the range of
applicability of the FIT. The approach proposed by Newberry et al. provides a
systematic way of generating hypotheses about language change, marking another
step forward in big-data driven linguistic research. However, along with the
possibilities, the limitations of the approach need to be appreciated. Caution
should be exercised with interpreting results of the FIT (and similar tests) on
individual series, given the demonstrable limitations, and fundamental
differences between genetic and linguistic data. Our findings also have
implications for selection testing and temporal binning in general.
