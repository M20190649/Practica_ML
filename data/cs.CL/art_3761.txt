BomJi at SemEval-2018 Task 10: Combining Vector-, Pattern- and
  Graph-based Information to Identify Discriminative Attributes
This paper describes BomJi, a supervised system for capturing discriminative
attributes in word pairs (e.g. yellow as discriminative for banana over
watermelon). The system relies on an XGB classifier trained on carefully
engineered graph-, pattern- and word embedding based features. It participated
in the SemEval- 2018 Task 10 on Capturing Discriminative Attributes, achieving
an F1 score of 0:73 and ranking 2nd out of 26 participant systems.
