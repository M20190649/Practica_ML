MorphNet: A sequence-to-sequence model that combines morphological
  analysis and disambiguation
We introduce MorphNet, a single model that combines morphological analysis
and disambiguation. Traditionally, analysis of morphologically complex
languages has been performed in two stages: (i) A morphological analyzer based
on finite-state transducers produces all possible morphological analyses of a
word, (ii) A statistical disambiguation model picks the correct analysis based
on the context for each word. MorphNet uses a sequence-to-sequence recurrent
neural network to combine analysis and disambiguation. We show that when
trained with text labeled with correct morphological analyses, MorphNet obtains
state-of-the art or comparable results for nine different datasets in seven
different languages.
