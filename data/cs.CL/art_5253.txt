Semi-interactive Attention Network for Answer Understanding in
  Reverse-QA
Question answering (QA) is an important natural language processing (NLP)
task and has received much attention in academic research and industry
communities. Existing QA studies assume that questions are raised by humans and
answers are generated by machines. Nevertheless, in many real applications,
machines are also required to determine human needs or perceive human states.
In such scenarios, machines may proactively raise questions and humans supply
answers. Subsequently, machines should attempt to understand the true meaning
of these answers. This new QA approach is called reverse-QA (rQA) throughout
this paper. In this work, the human answer understanding problem is
investigated and solved by classifying the answers into predefined answer-label
categories (e.g., True, False, Uncertain). To explore the relationships between
questions and answers, we use the interactive attention network (IAN) model and
propose an improved structure called semi-interactive attention network
(Semi-IAN). Two Chinese data sets for rQA are compiled. We evaluate several
conventional text classification models for comparison, and experimental
results indicate the promising performance of our proposed models.
