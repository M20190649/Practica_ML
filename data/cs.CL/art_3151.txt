Paying Attention to Multi-Word Expressions in Neural Machine Translation
Processing of multi-word expressions (MWEs) is a known problem for any
natural language processing task. Even neural machine translation (NMT)
struggles to overcome it. This paper presents results of experiments on
investigating NMT attention allocation to the MWEs and improving automated
translation of sentences that contain MWEs in English->Latvian and
English->Czech NMT systems. Two improvement strategies were explored -(1)
bilingual pairs of automatically extracted MWE candidates were added to the
parallel corpus used to train the NMT system, and (2) full sentences containing
the automatically extracted MWE candidates were added to the parallel corpus.
Both approaches allowed to increase automated evaluation results. The best
result - 0.99 BLEU point increase - has been reached with the first approach,
while with the second approach minimal improvements achieved. We also provide
open-source software and tools used for MWE extraction and alignment
inspection.
