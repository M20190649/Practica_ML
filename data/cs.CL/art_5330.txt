Review Conversational Reading Comprehension
Seeking information about products and services is an important activity of
online consumers before making a purchase decision. Inspired by recent research
on conversational reading comprehension (CRC) on formal documents, this paper
studies the task of leveraging knowledge from a huge amount of reviews to
answer multi-turn questions from consumers or users. Questions spanning
multiple turns in a dialogue enables users to ask more specific questions that
are hard to ask within a single question as in traditional machine reading
comprehension (MRC). In this paper, we first build a dataset and then propose a
novel task-adaptation approach to encoding the formulation of CRC task into a
pre-trained language model. This task-adaptation approach is unsupervised and
can greatly enhance the performance of the end CRC task that has only limited
supervision. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is highly
effective and has competitive performance as supervised approach. We plan to
release the datasets and the code in May 2019.
