The Code2Text Challenge: Text Generation in Source Code Libraries
We propose a new shared task for tactical data-to-text generation in the
domain of source code libraries. Specifically, we focus on text generation of
function descriptions from example software projects. Data is drawn from
existing resources used for studying the related problem of semantic parser
induction (Richardson and Kuhn, 2017b; Richardson and Kuhn, 2017a), and spans a
wide variety of both natural languages and programming languages. In this
paper, we describe these existing resources, which will serve as training and
development data for the task, and discuss plans for building new independent
test sets.
