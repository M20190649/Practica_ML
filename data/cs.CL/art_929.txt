Detecting and ordering adjectival scalemates
This paper presents a pattern-based method that can be used to infer
adjectival scales, such as <lukewarm, warm, hot>, from a corpus. Specifically,
the proposed method uses lexical patterns to automatically identify and order
pairs of scalemates, followed by a filtering phase in which unrelated pairs are
discarded. For the filtering phase, several different similarity measures are
implemented and compared. The model presented in this paper is evaluated using
the current standard, along with a novel evaluation set, and shown to be at
least as good as the current state-of-the-art.
