Cell-aware Stacked LSTMs for Modeling Sentences
We propose a method of stacking multiple long short-term memory (LSTM) layers
for modeling sentences. In contrast to the conventional stacked LSTMs where
only hidden states are fed as input to the next layer, our architecture accepts
both hidden and memory cell states of the preceding layer and fuses information
from the left and the lower context using the soft gating mechanism of LSTMs.
Thus the proposed stacked LSTM architecture modulates the amount of information
to be delivered not only in horizontal recurrence but also in vertical
connections, from which useful features extracted from lower layers are
effectively conveyed to upper layers. We dub this architecture Cell-aware
Stacked LSTM (CAS-LSTM) and show from experiments that our models achieve
state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets for natural language inference,
paraphrase detection, and sentiment classification.
