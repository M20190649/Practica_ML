A Survey on Deep Learning for Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) is the task to identify text spans that
mention named entities, and to classify them into predefined categories such as
person, location, organization etc. NER serves as the basis for a variety of
natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization,
and machine translation. Although early NER systems are successful in producing
decent recognition accuracy, they often require much human effort in carefully
designing rules or features. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by
continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through
nonlinear processing, has been employed in NER systems, yielding
stat-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review
on existing deep learning techniques for NER. We first introduce NER resources,
including tagged NER corpora and off-the-shelf NER tools. Then, we
systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes:
distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. Next,
we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep
learning in new NER problem settings and applications. Finally, we present
readers with the challenges faced by NER systems and outline future directions
in this area.
