Adposition and Case Supersenses v2.3: Guidelines for English
This document offers a detailed linguistic description of SNACS (Semantic
Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses; Schneider et al., 2018), an
inventory of 50 semantic labels ("supersenses") that characterize the use of
adpositions and case markers at a somewhat coarse level of granularity, as
demonstrated in the STREUSLE corpus (https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/;
version 4.2 will track guidelines version 2.3). Though the SNACS inventory
aspires to be universal, this document is specific to English; documentation
for other languages will be published separately.
  Version 2 is a revision of the supersense inventory proposed for English by
Schneider et al. (2015, 2016) (henceforth "v1"), which in turn was based on
previous schemes. The present inventory was developed after extensive review of
the v1 corpus annotations for English, plus previously unanalyzed genitive case
possessives (Blodgett and Schneider, 2018), as well as consideration of
adposition and case phenomena in Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and German. Hwang et
al. (2017) present the theoretical underpinnings of the v2 scheme. Schneider et
al. (2018) summarize the scheme, its application to English corpus data, and an
automatic disambiguation task.
