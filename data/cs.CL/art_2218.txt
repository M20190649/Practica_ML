Social Media Argumentation Mining: The Quest for Deliberateness in
  Raucousness
Argumentation mining from social media content has attracted increasing
attention. The task is both challenging and rewarding. The informal nature of
user-generated content makes the task dauntingly difficult. On the other hand,
the insights that could be gained by a large-scale analysis of social media
argumentation make it a very worthwhile task. In this position paper I discuss
the motivation for social media argumentation mining, as well as the tasks and
challenges involved.
