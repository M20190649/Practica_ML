MMCR4NLP: Multilingual Multiway Corpora Repository for Natural Language
  Processing
Multilinguality is gradually becoming ubiquitous in the sense that more and
more researchers have successfully shown that using additional languages help
improve the results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. Multilingual
Multiway Corpora (MMC) contain the same sentence in multiple languages. Such
corpora have been primarily used for Multi-Source and Pivot Language Machine
Translation but are also useful for developing multilingual sequence taggers by
transfer learning. While these corpora are available, they are not organized
for multilingual experiments and researchers need to write boilerplate code
every time they want to use said corpora. Moreover, because there is no
official MMC collection it becomes difficult to compare against existing
approaches. As such we present our work on creating a unified and
systematically organized repository of MMC spanning a large number of
languages. We also provide training, development and test splits for corpora
where official splits are unavailable. We hope that this will help speed up the
pace of multilingual NLP research and ensure that NLP researchers obtain
results that are more trustable since they can be compared easily. We indicate
corpora sources, extraction procedures if any and relevant statistics. We also
make our collection public for research purposes.
