Improving Retrieval-Based Question Answering with Deep Inference Models
Question answering is one of the most important and difficult applications at
the border of information retrieval and natural language processing, especially
when we talk about complex science questions which require some form of
inference to determine the correct answer. In this paper, we present a two-step
method that combines information retrieval techniques optimized for question
answering with deep learning models for natural language inference in order to
tackle the multi-choice question answering in the science domain. For each
question-answer pair, we use standard retrieval-based models to find relevant
candidate contexts and decompose the main problem into two different
sub-problems. First, assign correctness scores for each candidate answer based
on the context using retrieval models from Lucene. Second, we use deep learning
architectures to compute if a candidate answer can be inferred from some
well-chosen context consisting of sentences retrieved from the knowledge base.
In the end, all these solvers are combined using a simple neural network to
predict the correct answer. This proposed two-step model outperforms the best
retrieval-based solver by over 3% in absolute accuracy.
