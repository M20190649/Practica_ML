Overview of the NLPCC 2015 Shared Task: Chinese Word Segmentation and
  POS Tagging for Micro-blog Texts
In this paper, we give an overview for the shared task at the 4th CCF
Conference on Natural Language Processing \& Chinese Computing (NLPCC 2015):
Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for micro-blog
texts. Different with the popular used newswire datasets, the dataset of this
shared task consists of the relatively informal micro-texts. The shared task
has two sub-tasks: (1) individual Chinese word segmentation and (2) joint
Chinese word segmentation and POS Tagging. Each subtask has three tracks to
distinguish the systems with different resources. We first introduce the
dataset and task, then we characterize the different approaches of the
participating systems, report the test results, and provide a overview analysis
of these results. An online system is available for open registration and
evaluation at http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpcc2015.
