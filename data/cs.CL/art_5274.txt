Chemical Names Standardization using Neural Sequence to Sequence Model
Chemical information extraction is to convert chemical knowledge in text into
true chemical database, which is a text processing task heavily relying on
chemical compound name identification and standardization. Once a systematic
name for a chemical compound is given, it will naturally and much simply
convert the name into the eventually required molecular formula. However, for
many chemical substances, they have been shown in many other names besides
their systematic names which poses a great challenge for this task. In this
paper, we propose a framework to do the auto standardization from the
non-systematic names to the corresponding systematic names by using the
spelling error correction, byte pair encoding tokenization and neural sequence
to sequence model. Our framework is trained end to end and is fully
data-driven. Our standardization accuracy on the test dataset achieves 54.04%
which has a great improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art result.
