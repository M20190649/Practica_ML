Document Structure Measure for Hypernym discovery
Hypernym discovery is the problem of finding terms that have is-a
relationship with a given term. We introduce a new context type, and a
relatedness measure to differentiate hypernyms from other types of semantic
relationships. Our Document Structure measure is based on hierarchical position
of terms in a document, and their presence or otherwise in definition text.
This measure quantifies the document structure using multiple attributes, and
classes of weighted distance functions.
