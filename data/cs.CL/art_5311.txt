Span Based Open Information Extraction
Open information extraction (Open IE) is achallenging task especially due to
its brittledata basis. Most of Open IE systems have to betrained on
automatically built corpus and eval-uated on inaccurate test set. In this work,
wefirst alleviate this difficulty from both sides oftraining and test sets. For
the former, we pro-pose an improved model design to more suffi-ciently exploit
training dataset. For the latter,we present our accurately re-annotated
bench-mark test set (Re-OIE6) according to a seriesof linguistic observation
and analysis. Then,we introduce a span model instead of previousadopted
sequence labeling formulization forn-ary Open IE. Our newly introduced
modelachieves new state-of-the-art performance onboth benchmark evaluation
datasets.
