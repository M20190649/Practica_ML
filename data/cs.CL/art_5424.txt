Context-aware Neural-based Dialog Act Classification on Automatically
  Generated Transcriptions
This paper presents our latest investigations on dialog act (DA)
classification on automatically generated transcriptions. We propose a novel
approach that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conditional
random fields (CRFs) for context modeling in DA classification. We explore the
impact of transcriptions generated from different automatic speech recognition
systems such as hybrid TDNN/HMM and End-to-End systems on the final
performance. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (MRDA and SwDA)
show that the combination CNN and CRF improves consistently the accuracy.
Furthermore, they show that although the word error rates are comparable,
End-to-End ASR system seems to be more suitable for DA classification.
