Parsing with CYK over Distributed Representations
Syntactic parsing is a key task in natural language processing. This task has
been dominated by symbolic, grammar-based parsers. Neural networks, with their
distributed representations, are challenging these methods. In this article we
show that existing symbolic parsing algorithms can cross the border and be
entirely formulated over distributed representations. To this end we introduce
a version of the traditional Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, called
D-CYK, which is entirely defined over distributed representations. Our D-CYK
uses matrix multiplication on real number matrices of size independent of the
length of the input string. These operations are compatible with traditional
neural networks. Experiments show that our D-CYK approximates the original CYK
algorithm. By showing that CYK can be entirely performed on distributed
representations, we open the way to the definition of recurrent layers of
CYK-informed neural networks.
