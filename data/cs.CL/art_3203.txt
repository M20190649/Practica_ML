Shallow Discourse Parsing with Maximum Entropy Model
In recent years, more research has been devoted to studying the subtask of
the complete shallow discourse parsing, such as indentifying discourse
connective and arguments of connective. There is a need to design a full
discourse parser to pull these subtasks together. So we develop a discourse
parser turning the free text into discourse relations. The parser includes
connective identifier, arguments identifier, sense classifier and non-explicit
identifier, which connects with each other in pipeline. Each component applies
the maximum entropy model with abundant lexical and syntax features extracted
from the Penn Discourse Tree-bank. The head-based representation of the PDTB is
adopted in the arguments identifier, which turns the problem of indentifying
the arguments of discourse connective into finding the head and end of the
arguments. In the non-explicit identifier, the contextual type features like
words which have high frequency and can reflect the discourse relation are
introduced to improve the performance of non-explicit identifier. Compared with
other methods, experimental results achieve the considerable performance.
