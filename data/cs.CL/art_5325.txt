Riconoscimento ortografico per apostrofo ed espressioni polirematiche
The work presents two algorithms of manipulation and comparison between
strings whose purpose is the orthographic recognition of the apostrophe and of
the compound expressions. The theory supporting general reasoning refers to the
basic concept of EditDistance, the improvements that ensure the achievement of
the objective are achieved with the aid of tools borrowed from the use of
techniques for processing large amounts of data on distributed platforms.
