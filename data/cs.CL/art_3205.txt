Grammar Induction for Minimalist Grammars using Variational Bayesian
  Inference : A Technical Report
The following technical report presents a formal approach to probabilistic
minimalist grammar parameter estimation. We describe a formalization of a
minimalist grammar. We then present an algorithm for the application of
variational Bayesian inference to this formalization.
