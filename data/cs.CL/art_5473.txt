Overview of the Ugglan Entity Discovery and Linking System
Ugglan is a system designed to discover named entities and link them to
unique identifiers in a knowledge base. It is based on a combination of a name
and nominal dictionary derived from Wikipedia and Wikidata, a named entity
recognition module (NER) using fixed ordinally-forgetting encoding (FOFE)
trained on the TAC EDL data from 2014-2016, a candidate generation module from
the Wikipedia link graph across multiple editions, a PageRank link and
cooccurrence graph disambiguator, and finally a reranker trained on the TAC EDL
2015-2016 data.
