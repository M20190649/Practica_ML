FastFusionNet: New State-of-the-Art for DAWNBench SQuAD
In this technical report, we introduce FastFusionNet, an efficient variant of
FusionNet [12]. FusionNet is a high performing reading comprehension
architecture, which was designed primarily for maximum retrieval accuracy with
less regard towards computational requirements. For FastFusionNets we remove
the expensive CoVe layers [21] and substitute the BiLSTMs with far more
efficient SRU layers [19]. The resulting architecture obtains state-of-the-art
results on DAWNBench [5] while achieving the lowest training and inference time
on SQuAD [25] to-date. The code is available at
