You Shall Know the Most Frequent Sense by the Company it Keeps
Identification of the most frequent sense of a polysemous word is an
important semantic task. We introduce two concepts that can benefit MFS
detection: companions, which are the most frequently co-occurring words, and
the most frequent translation in a bitext. We present two novel methods that
incorporate these new concepts, and show that they advance the state of the art
on MFS detection.
