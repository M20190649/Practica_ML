Large-scale Hierarchical Alignment for Data-driven Text Rewriting
We propose a simple unsupervised method for extracting pseudo-parallel
monolingual sentence pairs from comparable corpora representative of two
different text styles, such as news articles and scientific papers. Our
approach does not require a seed parallel corpus, but instead relies solely on
hierarchical search over pre-trained embeddings of documents and sentences. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through automatic and extrinsic
evaluation on text simplification from the normal to the Simple Wikipedia. We
show that pseudo-parallel sentences extracted with our method not only
supplement existing parallel data, but can even lead to competitive performance
on their own.
