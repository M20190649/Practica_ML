End-To-End Speech Recognition Using A High Rank LSTM-CTC Based Model
Long Short Term Memory Connectionist Temporal Classification (LSTM-CTC) based
end-to-end models are widely used in speech recognition due to its simplicity
in training and efficiency in decoding. In conventional LSTM-CTC based models,
a bottleneck projection matrix maps the hidden feature vectors obtained from
LSTM to softmax output layer. In this paper, we propose to use a high rank
projection layer to replace the projection matrix. The output from the high
rank projection layer is a weighted combination of vectors that are projected
from the hidden feature vectors via different projection matrices and
non-linear activation function. The high rank projection layer is able to
improve the expressiveness of LSTM-CTC models. The experimental results show
that on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus and LibriSpeech data set, the proposed
method achieves 4%-6% relative word error rate (WER) reduction over the
baseline CTC system. They outperform other published CTC based end-to-end (E2E)
models under the condition that no external data or data augmentation is
applied. Code has been made available at https://github.com/mobvoi/lstm_ctc.
