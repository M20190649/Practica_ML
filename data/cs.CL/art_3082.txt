What Words Do We Use to Lie?: Word Choice in Deceptive Messages
Text messaging is the most widely used form of computer- mediated
communication (CMC). Previous findings have shown that linguistic factors can
reliably indicate messages as deceptive. For example, users take longer and use
more words to craft deceptive messages than they do truthful messages. Existing
research has also examined how factors, such as student status and gender,
affect rates of deception and word choice in deceptive messages. However, this
research has been limited by small sample sizes and has returned contradicting
findings. This paper aims to address these issues by using a dataset of text
messages collected from a large and varied set of participants using an Android
messaging application. The results of this paper show significant differences
in word choice and frequency of deceptive messages between male and female
participants, as well as between students and non-students.
