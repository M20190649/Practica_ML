SemEval-2019 Task 1: Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing with UCCA
We present the SemEval 2019 shared task on UCCA parsing in English, German
and French, and discuss the participating systems and results. UCCA is a
cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, which
builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses
a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy
(resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes
corresponding to complex semantic units. The shared task has yielded
improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline in all languages and settings.
