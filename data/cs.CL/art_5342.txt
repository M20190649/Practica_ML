On the Choice of Modeling Unit for Sequence-to-Sequence Speech
  Recognition
In conventional speech recognition, phoneme-based models outperform
grapheme-based models for non-phonetic languages such as English. The
performance gap between the two typically reduces as the amount of training
data is increased. In this work, we examine the impact of the choice of
modeling unit for attention-based encoder-decoder models. We conduct
experiments on the LibriSpeech 100hr, 460hr, and 960hr tasks, using various
target units (phoneme, grapheme, and word-piece); across all tasks, we find
that grapheme or word-piece models consistently outperform phoneme-based
models, even though they are evaluated without a lexicon or an external
language model. We also investigate model complementarity: we find that we can
improve WERs by up to 9% relative by rescoring N-best lists generated from a
strong word-piece based baseline with either the phoneme or the grapheme model.
Rescoring an N-best list generated by the phonemic system, however, provides
limited improvements. Further analysis shows that the word-piece-based models
produce more diverse N-best hypotheses, and thus lower oracle WERs, than
phonemic models.
