A neural joint model for Vietnamese word segmentation, POS tagging and
  dependency parsing
We propose the first joint multi-task model for Vietnamese word segmentation,
part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing. Our model extends the BIST
graph-based dependency parser (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016) with
BiLSTM-CRF-based neural layers (Huang et al., 2015) for word segmentation and
POS tagging. On benchmark Vietnamese datasets, experimental results show that
our joint model obtains state-of-the-art or competitive performances.
