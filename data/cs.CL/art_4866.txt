A Machine Learning Approach to Persian Text Readability Assessment Using
  a Crowdsourced Dataset
An automated approach to text readability assessment is essential to a
language and can be a powerful tool for improving the understandability of
texts written and published in that language. However, the Persian language,
which is spoken by over 110 million speakers, lacks such a system. Unlike other
languages such as English, French, and Chinese, very limited research studies
have been carried out to build an accurate and reliable text readability
assessment system for the Persian language. In the present research, the first
Persian dataset for text readability assessment was gathered and the first
model for Persian text readability assessment using machine learning was
introduced. The experiments showed that this model was accurate and could
assess the readability of Persian texts with a high degree of confidence. The
results of this study can be used in a number of applications such as medical
and educational text readability evaluation and have the potential to be the
cornerstone of future studies in Persian text readability assessment.
