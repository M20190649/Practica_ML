Multi-Perspective Fusion Network for Commonsense Reading Comprehension
Commonsense Reading Comprehension (CRC) is a significantly challenging task,
aiming at choosing the right answer for the question referring to a narrative
passage, which may require commonsense knowledge inference. Most of the
existing approaches only fuse the interaction information of choice, passage,
and question in a simple combination manner from a \emph{union} perspective,
which lacks the comparison information on a deeper level. Instead, we propose a
Multi-Perspective Fusion Network (MPFN), extending the single fusion method
with multiple perspectives by introducing the \emph{difference} and
\emph{similarity} fusion\deleted{along with the \emph{union}}. More
comprehensive and accurate information can be captured through the three types
of fusion. We design several groups of experiments on MCScript dataset
\cite{Ostermann:LREC18:MCScript} to evaluate the effectiveness of the three
types of fusion respectively. From the experimental results, we can conclude
that the difference fusion is comparable with union fusion, and the similarity
fusion needs to be activated by the union fusion. The experimental result also
shows that our MPFN model achieves the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of
83.52\% on the official test set.
