The Marchex 2018 English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition
  System
In this paper, we describe recent performance improvements to the production
Marchex speech recognition system for our spontaneous customer-to-business
telephone conversations. In our previous work, we focused on in-domain language
and acoustic model training. In this work we employ state-of-the-art
semi-supervised lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) training
process which can supervise over full lattices from unlabeled audio. On Marchex
English (ME), a modern evaluation set of conversational North American English,
we observed a 3.3% (3.2% for agent, 3.6% for caller) reduction in absolute word
error rate (WER) with 3x faster decoding speed over the performance of the 2017
production system. We expect this improvement boost Marchex Call Analytics
system performance especially for natural language processing pipeline.
