DEMN: Distilled-Exposition Enhanced Matching Network for Story
  Comprehension
This paper proposes a Distilled-Exposition Enhanced Matching Network (DEMN)
for story-cloze test, which is still a challenging task in story comprehension.
We divide a complete story into three narrative segments: an
\textit{exposition}, a \textit{climax}, and an \textit{ending}. The model
consists of three modules: input module, matching module, and distillation
module. The input module provides semantic representations for the three
segments and then feeds them into the other two modules. The matching module
collects interaction features between the ending and the climax. The
distillation module distills the crucial semantic information in the exposition
and infuses it into the matching module in two different ways. We evaluate our
single and ensemble model on ROCStories Corpus \cite{Mostafazadeh2016ACA},
achieving an accuracy of 80.1\% and 81.2\% on the test set respectively. The
experimental results demonstrate that our DEMN model achieves a
state-of-the-art performance.
