Answering Comparative Questions: Better than Ten-Blue-Links?
We present CAM (comparative argumentative machine), a novel open-domain IR
system to argumentatively compare objects with respect to information extracted
from the Common Crawl. In a user study, the participants obtained 15% more
accurate answers using CAM compared to a "traditional" keyword-based search and
were 20% faster in finding the answer to comparative questions.
