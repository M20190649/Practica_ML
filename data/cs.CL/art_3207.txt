On the importance of normative data in speech-based assessment
Data sets for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often relatively
sparse, which limits their ability to train generalizable models. Here, we
augment such a data set, DementiaBank, with each of two normative data sets,
the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and Talk2Me, each of which employs a
speech-based picture-description assessment. Through minority class
oversampling with ADASYN, we outperform state-of-the-art results in binary
classification of people with and without AD in DementiaBank. This work
highlights the effectiveness of combining sparse and difficult-to-acquire
patient data with relatively large and easily accessible normative datasets.
