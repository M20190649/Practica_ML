Neural Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Robust Character-Based
  Part-of-Speech Tagging
Character-level models of tokens have been shown to be effective at dealing
with within-token noise and out-of-vocabulary words. But these models still
rely on correct token boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end
character-level model and demonstrate its effectiveness in multilingual
settings and when token boundaries are noisy. Our model is a semi-Markov
conditional random field with neural networks for character and segment
representation. It requires no tokenizer. The model matches state-of-the-art
baselines for various languages and significantly outperforms them on a noisy
English version of a part-of-speech tagging benchmark dataset. Our code and the
noisy dataset are publicly available at http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/semiCRF.
