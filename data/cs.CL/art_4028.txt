Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language
The availability of large diachronic corpora has provided the impetus for a
growing body of quantitative research on language evolution and meaning change.
The central quantities in this research are token frequencies of linguistic
elements in texts, with changes in frequency taken to reflect the popularity or
selective fitness of an element. However, corpus frequencies may change for a
wide variety of reasons, including purely random sampling effects, or because
corpora are composed of contemporary media and fiction texts within which the
underlying topics ebb and flow with cultural and socio-political trends. In
this work, we introduce a simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations
in corpora - the topical-cultural advection model - and demonstrate how it
provides a robust baseline of variability in word frequency changes over time.
We validate the model on a diachronic corpus spanning two centuries, and a
carefully-controlled artificial language change scenario, and then use it to
correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series. Finally, we use the
model to show that the emergence of new words typically corresponds with the
rise of a trending topic. This suggests that some lexical innovations occur due
to growing communicative need in a subspace of the lexicon, and that the
topical-cultural advection model can be used to quantify this.
