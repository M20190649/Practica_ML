Deconstructing Word Embeddings
A review of Word Embedding Models through a deconstructive approach reveals
their several shortcomings and inconsistencies. These include instability of
the vector representations, a distorted analogical reasoning, geometric
incompatibility with linguistic features, and the inconsistencies in the corpus
data. A new theoretical embedding model, Derridian Embedding, is proposed in
this paper. Contemporary embedding models are evaluated qualitatively in terms
of how adequate they are in relation to the capabilities of a Derridian
Embedding.
