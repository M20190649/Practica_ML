KBQA: Learning Question Answering over QA Corpora and Knowledge Bases
Question answering (QA) has become a popular way for humans to access
billion-scale knowledge bases. Unlike web search, QA over a knowledge base
gives out accurate and concise results, provided that natural language
questions can be understood and mapped precisely to structured queries over the
knowledge base. The challenge, however, is that a human can ask one question in
many different ways. Previous approaches have natural limits due to their
representations: rule based approaches only understand a small set of "canned"
questions, while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fully
understand the questions. In this paper, we design a new kind of question
representation: templates, over a billion scale knowledge base and a million
scale QA corpora. For example, for questions about a city's population, we
learn templates such as What's the population of $city?, How many people are
there in $city?. We learned 27 million templates for 2782 intents. Based on
these templates, our QA system KBQA effectively supports binary factoid
questions, as well as complex questions which are composed of a series of
binary factoid questions. Furthermore, we expand predicates in RDF knowledge
base, which boosts the coverage of knowledge base by 57 times. Our QA system
beats all other state-of-art works on both effectiveness and efficiency over
QALD benchmarks.
