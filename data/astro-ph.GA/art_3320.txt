Very Large Array Detection of the 36 GHz Zeeman Effect in DR21W
  Revisited
We report on the observation of the 36 GHz methanol maser line in the star
forming region DR21W to accurately measure the Zeeman effect. The reported
Zeeman signature by Fish et al. (2011) became suspicious after an instrumental
effect was discovered in the early days of the Very Large Array Wide-band
Digital Architecture (WIDAR) correlator commissioning. We conclude that the
previously reported magnetic field strength of 58 mG ((1.7 Hz/mG)/z) is
instrumental in nature and thus incorrect. With the improved performance of the
array, we now deduce a 3 sigma limit of -4.7 to +0.4 mG ((1.7 Hz/mG)/z) for the
line-of-sight component of the magnetic field strength in DR21W.
