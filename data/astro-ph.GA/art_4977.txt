A Survey of Satellite Galaxies around NGC 4258
We conduct a survey of satellite galaxies around the nearby spiral NGC 4258
by combining spectroscopic observations from the Apache Point Observatory
3.5-meter telescope with SDSS spectra. New spectroscopy is obtained for 15
galaxies. Of the 47 observed objects, we categorize 8 of them as probable
satellites, 8 as possible satellites, and 17 as unlikely to be satellites. We
do not speculate on the membership of the remaining 14 galaxies due to a lack
of velocity and distance information. Radially integrating our best fit NFW
profile for NGC 4258 yields a total mass of 1.8e12 Msun within 200 kpc. We find
that the angular distribution of the satellites appears to be random, and not
preferentially aligned with the disk of NGC 4258. In addition, many of the
probable satellite galaxies have blue u-r colors and appear to be star-forming
irregulars in SDSS images; this stands in contrast to the low number of blue
satellites in the Milky Way and M31 systems at comparable distances.
