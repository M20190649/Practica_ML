[12CII] and [13CII] 158 mum emission from NGC 2024: Large column
  densities of ionized carbon
Context: We analyze the NGC 2024 HII region and molecular cloud interface
using [12CII] and [13CII] observations. Aims: We attempt to gain insight into
the physical structure of the interface layer between the molecular cloud and
the HII region. Methods. Observations of [12CII] and [13CII] emission at 158
{\mu}m with high spatial and spectral resolution allow us to study the detailed
structure of the ionization front and estimate the column densities and
temperatures of the ionized carbon layer in the PDR. Results: The [12CII]
emission closely follows the distribution of the 8 mum continuum. Across most
of the source, the spectral lines have two velocity peaks similar to lines of
rare CO isotopes. The [13CII] emission is detected near the edge-on ionization
front. It has only a single velocity component, which implies that the [12CII]
line shape is caused by self-absorption. An anomalous hyperfine line-intensity
ratio observed in [13CII] cannot yet be explained. Conclusions: Our analysis of
the two isotopes results in a total column density of N(H)~1.6\times10^23 cm^-2
in the gas emitting the [CII] line. A large fraction of this gas has to be at a
temperature of several hundred K. The self-absorption is caused by a cooler
(T<=100 K) foreground component containing a column density of N(H)~10^22
cm^-2.
