The molecular clump towards the eastern border of SNR G18.8+0.3
The eastern border of the SNR G18.8+0.3, close to an HII regions complex, is
a very interesting region to study the molecular gas that it is probably in
contact with the SNR shock front. We observed the aforementioned region using
the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in the 12CO J=3-2, 13CO
J=3-2, HCO+ J=4-3, and CS J=7-6 lines with an angular resolution of 22". To
complement these observations, we analyzed IR, submillimeter and radio
continuum archival data. In this work, we clearly show that the radio continuum
"protrusion" that was early thought to belong to the SNR is an HII regions
complex deeply embedded in a molecular clump. The new molecular observations
reveal that this dense clump, belonging to an extended molecular cloud that
surrounds the SNR southeast border, is not physically in contact with SNR
G18.8+0.3, suggesting that the SNR shock front have not yet reached it or maybe
they are located at different distances. We found some young stellar objects
embedded in the molecular clump, suggesting that their formation should be
approximately coeval with the SN explosion.
