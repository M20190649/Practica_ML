AMI Observations of the Anomalous Microwave Emission in the Perseus
  Molecular Cloud
We present observations of the known anomalous microwave emission region,
G159.6-18.5, in the Perseus molecular cloud at 16 GHz performed with the
Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Small Array. These are the highest angular
resolution observations of G159.6-18.5 at microwave wavelengths. By combining
these microwave data with infrared observations between 5.8 and 160 \mu m from
the Spitzer Space Telescope, we investigate the existence of a microwave -
infrared correlation on angular scales of ~2 arcmin. We find that the overall
correlation appears to increase towards shorter infrared wavelengths, which is
consistent with the microwave emission being produced by electric dipole
radiation from small, spinning dust grains. We also find that the microwave -
infrared correlation peaks at 24 \mu m (6.7\sigma), suggesting that the
microwave emission is originating from a population of stochastically heated
small interstellar dust grains rather than polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
