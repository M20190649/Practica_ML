Magnetic Spiral Arms and Galactic Outflows
Galactic magnetic arms have been observed between the gaseous arms of some
spiral galaxies; their origin remains unclear. We suggest that magnetic spiral
arms can be naturally generated in the interarm regions because the galactic
fountain flow or wind is likely to be weaker there than in the arms. Galactic
outflows lead to two countervailing effects: removal of small-scale magnetic
helicity, which helps to avert catastrophic quenching of the dynamo, and
advection of the large-scale magnetic field, which suppresses dynamo action.
For realistic galactic parameters, the net consequence of outflows being
stronger in the gaseous arms is higher saturation large-scale field strengths
in the interarm regions as compared to in the arms. By incorporating rather
realistic models of spiral structure and evolution into our dynamo models, an
interlaced pattern of magnetic and gaseous arms can be produced.
