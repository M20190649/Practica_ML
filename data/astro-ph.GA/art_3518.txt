Luminosity-Colour Relations for Red Clump Stars
We calibrated the $M_V$, $M_J$, $M_{K_s}$ and $M_g$ absolute magnitudes of
red clump stars in terms of colours. $M_V$ and $M_g$ are strongly dependent on
colour, while the dependence of $M_J$ and $M_{K_s}$ on colour is rather weak.
The calibration of $M_V$ and $M_{K_s}$ absolute magnitudes is tested on 101 RC
stars in the field SA 141. The Galactic model parameters estimated with this
sample are in good agreement with earlier studies.
