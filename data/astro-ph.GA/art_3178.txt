Star Cluster Populations in the Outer Disks of Nearby Galaxies
We present a Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) imaging study that characterizes
the star cluster component of nearby galaxy outer disks (beyond the optical
radius R_25). Expanding on the pilot project of Herbert-Fort et al. (2009), we
present deep (~ 27.5 mag V-band point-source limiting magnitude) U- and V-band
imaging of six galaxies: IC 4182, NGC 3351, NGC 4736, NGC 4826, NGC 5474, and
NGC 6503. We find that the outer disk of each galaxy is populated with
marginally-resolved star clusters with masses ~10^3 M_sun and ages up to ~ 1
Gyr (masses and ages are limited by the depth of our imaging and uncertainties
are large given how photometry can be strongly affected by the presence or
absence of a few stars in such low mass systems), and that they are typically
found out to at least 2 R_25 but sometimes as far as 3 to 4 R_25- even beyond
the apparent HI disk. The mean rate of cluster formation for 1 R_25<= R <=
1.5R_25 is at least one every ~2.5 Myr and the clusters are spatially
correlated with the HI, most strongly with higher density gas near the
periphery of the optical disk and with lower density neutral gas at the HI disk
periphery. We hypothesize that the clusters near the edge of the optical disk
are formed in the extension of spiral structure from the inner disk and are a
fairly consistent phenomenon and that the clusters formed at the periphery of
the HI disk are the result of accretion episodes.
