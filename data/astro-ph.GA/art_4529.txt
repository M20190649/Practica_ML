SMA Submillimeter Observations of HL Tau: Revealing a compact molecular
  outflow
We present archival high angular resolution ($\sim$ 2$''$) $^{12}$CO(3-2)
line and continuum submillimeter observations of the young stellar object HL
Tau made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The $^{12}$CO(3-2) line
observations reveal the presence of a compact and wide opening angle bipolar
outflow with a northeast and southwest orientation (P.A. = 50$^\circ$), and
that is associated with the optical and infrared jet emanating from HL Tau with
a similar orientation. On the other hand, the 850 $\mu$m continuum emission
observations exhibit a strong and compact source in the position of HL Tau that
has a spatial size of $\sim$ 200 $\times$ 70 AU with a P.A. $=$ 145$^\circ$,
and a dust mass of around 0.1 M$_\odot$. These physical parameters are in
agreement with values obtained recently from millimeter observations. This
submillimeter source is therefore related with the disk surrounding HL Tau.
