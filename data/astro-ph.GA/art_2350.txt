The Candidate Intermediate-Mass Black Hole in the Globular Cluster M54
Ibata et al. reported evidence for density and kinematic cusps in the
Galactic globular cluster M54, possibly due to the presence of a 9400
solar-mass black hole. Radiative signatures of accretion onto M54's candidate
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) could bolster the case for its existence.
Analysis of new Chandra and recent Hubble Space Telescope astrometry rules out
the X-ray counterpart to the candidate IMBH suggested by Ibata et al. If an
IMBH exists in M54, then it has an Eddington ratio of L(0.3-8 keV) / L(Edd) <
1.4 x 10^(-10), more similar to that of the candidate IMBH in M15 than that in
G1. From new imaging with the NRAO Very Large Array, the luminosity of the
candidate IMBH is L(8.5 GHz) < 3.6 x 10^29 ergs/s (3 sigma). Two background
active galaxies discovered toward M54 could serve as probes of its intracluster
medium.
