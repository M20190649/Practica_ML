Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge: different stellar populations
  and possible gradients
We compute the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge to explain the
existence of two main stellar populations recently observed. After comparing
model results and observational data we suggest that the old more metal poor
stellar population formed very fast (on a timescale of 0.1-0.3 Gyr) by means of
an intense burst of star formation and an initial mass function flatter than in
the solar vicinity whereas the metal rich population formed on a longer
timescale (3 Gyr). We predict differences in the mean abundances of the two
populations (-0.52 dex for <[Fe/H]>) which can be interpreted as a metallicity
gradients. We also predict possible gradients for Fe, O, Mg, Si, S and Ba
between sub-populations inside the metal poor population itself (e.g. -0.145
dex for <[Fe/H]>). Finally, by means of a chemo-dynamical model following a
dissipational collapse, we predict a gradient inside 500 pc from the Galactic
center of -0.26 dex kpc^{-1} in Fe.
