Adaptive Optics Observations of the Galactic Center Young Stars
Adaptive Optics observations have dramatically improved the quality and
versatility of high angular resolution measurements of the center of our
Galaxy. In this paper, we quantify the quality of our Adaptive Optics
observations and report on the astrometric precision for the young stellar
population that appears to reside in a stellar disk structure in the central
parsec. We show that with our improved astrometry and a 16 year baseline,
including 10 years of speckle and 6 years of laser guide star AO imaging, we
reliably detect accelerations in the plane of the sky as small as 70
microarcsec/yr/yr (~2.5 km/s/yr) and out to a projected radius from the
supermassive black hole of 1.5" (~0.06 pc). With an increase in sensitivity to
accelerations by a factor of ~6 over our previous efforts, we are able to
directly probe the kinematic structure of the young stellar disk, which appears
to have an inner radius of 0.8". We find that candidate disk members are on
eccentric orbits, with a mean eccentricity of < e > = 0.30 +/- 0.07. Such
eccentricities cannot be explained by the relaxation of a circular disk with a
normal initial mass function, which suggests the existence of a top-heavy IMF
or formation in an initially eccentric disk.
