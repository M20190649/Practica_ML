Trigonometric Parallaxes of Star Forming Regions in the Perseus Spiral
  Arm
We report trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of water masers for 12
massive star forming regions in the Perseus spiral arm of the Milky Way as part
of the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey. Combining our results
with 14 parallax measurements in the literature, we estimate a pitch angle of
9.9 +/- 1.5 degrees for a section of the Perseus arm. The three-dimensional
Galactic peculiar motions of these sources indicate that on average they are
moving toward the Galactic center and slower than the Galactic rotation.
