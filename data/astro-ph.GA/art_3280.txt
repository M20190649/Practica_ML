A New CEMP-s RR Lyrae Star
We show that SDSS J170733.93+585059.7 (hereafter SDSS J1707+58), previously
identified by Aoki and collaborators as a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star (with
s-process-element enhancements; CEMP-s), on the assumption that it is a
main-sequence turn-off star, is the RR Lyrae star VIII-14 identified by the
Lick Astrograph Survey. Revised abundances for SDSS J1707+58 are [Fe/H] =
-2.92, [C/Fe] = +2.79, and [Ba/Fe] = +2.83. It is thus one of the most
metal-poor RR Lyrae stars known, and has more extreme [C/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] than
the only other RR Lyrae star known to have a CEMP-s spectrum (TY Gru). Both
stars are Oosterhoff II stars with prograde kinematics, in contrast to stars
with [C/Fe] < +0.7, such as KP Cyg and UY CrB, which are disk stars. Twelve
other RR Lyrae stars with [C/Fe] >= +0.7 are presented as CEMP candidates for
further study.
