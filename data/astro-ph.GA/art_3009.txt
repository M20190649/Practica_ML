XHIP-II: Clusters and associations
Context. In the absence of complete kinematic data it has not previously been
possible to furnish accurate lists of member stars for all moving groups. There
has been an unresolved dispute concerning the apparent inconsistency of the
Hipparcos parallax distance to the Pleiades.
  Aims. To find improved candidate lists for clusters and associations
represented among Hipparcos stars, to establish distances, and to cast light on
the Pleiades distance anomaly.
  Methods. We use a six dimensional fitting procedure to identify candidates,
and plot CMDs for 20 of the nearest groups. We calculate the mean parallax
distance for all groups.
  Results. We identify lists of candidates and calculated parallax distances
for 42 clusters and 45 associations represented within the Hipparcos catalogue.
We find agreement between parallax distance and photometric distances for the
most important clusters. For single stars in the Pleiades we find mean parallax
distance 125.6 \pm 4.2 pc and photometric distance 132 \pm 3 pc calibrated to
nearby groups of similar in age and composition. This gives no reason to doubt
either the Hipparcos database or stellar evolutionary theory.
