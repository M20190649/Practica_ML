A Multi-wavelength Study of the Host Environment of SMBHB 4C+37.11
4C+37.11, at z=0.055 shows two compact radio nuclei, imaged by VLBI at 7mas
separation, making it the closest known resolved super-massive black hole
binary (SMBHB). An important question is whether this unique object is young,
caught on the way to a gravitational in-spiral and merger, or has `stalled' at
7pc. We describe new radio/optical/X-ray observations of the massive host and
its surrounding X-ray halo. These data reveal X-ray/optical channels following
the radio outflow and large scale edges in the X-ray halo. These structures are
promising targets for further study which should elucidate their relationship
to the unique SMBHB core.
