The Source of Maser Emission W33C (G12.8-0.2)
Results of observations of the maser sources toward the W33C region
(G12.8-0.2) carried out on the 22-m radio telescope of the Pushchino Radio
Astronomy Observatory in the 1.35-cm H2O line and on the Large radio telescope
in Nancay (France) in the main (1665 and 1667 MHz) and satellite (1612 and 1720
MHz) OH lines are reported. Multiple, strongly variable short-lived H2O
emission features were detected in a broad interval of radial velocities, from
-7 to 55 km/s. OH maser emission in the 1667-MHz line was discovered in a
velocity range of 35-41 km/s. Stokes parameters of maser emission in the main
OH lines 1665 and 1667 MHz were measured. Zeeman splitting was detected in the
1665-MHz line at 33.4 and 39.4 km/s and in the 1667 MHz line only at 39.4 km/s.
The magnetic field intensity was estimated. A appreciable variability of Zeeman
splitting components was observed at 39 and 39.8 km/s in both main lines. The
extended spectrum and fast variability of the H2O maser emission together with
the variability of the Zeeman splitting components in the main OH lines can be
due to the composite clumpy structure of the molecular cloud and to the
presence in it of large-scale rotation and bipolar outflow as well as of
turbulent motions of material.
