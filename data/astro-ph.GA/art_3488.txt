Fullerenes in circumstellar and interstellar environments
In recent years, the fullerene species C60 (and to a lesser extent also C70)
has been reported in the mid-IR spectra of various astronomical objects. Cosmic
fullerenes form in the circumstellar material of evolved stars, and survive in
the interstellar medium (ISM). It is not entirely clear how they form or what
their excitation mechanism is.
