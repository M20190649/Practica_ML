The stellar-to-halo mass relations of local galaxies segregates by color
We derive the stellar-to-halo mass relations, SHMR, of local blue and red
central galaxies separately, as well as the fraction of halos hosting blue/red
central galaxies. We find that: 1) the SHMR of central galaxies is segregated
by color, with blue centrals having a SHMR above the one of red centrals; at
logMh~12, the Ms/Mh ratio of the blue centrals is ~0.05, which is ~1.7 times
larger than the value of red centrals. 2) The intrinsic scatters of the SHMRs
of red and blue centrals are ~0.14 and ~0.11dex, respectively. The intrinsic
scatter of the average SHMR of all central galaxies changes from ~0.20dex to
~0.14dex in the 11.3<logMh<15 range. 3) The fraction of halos hosting blue
centrals at Mh=1E11Msun is 87%, but at 2x1E12Msun decays to ~20%, approaching
to a few per cents at higher masses. The characteristic mass at which this
fraction is the same for blue and red galaxies is Mh~7x1E11Msun. Our results
suggest that the SHMR of central galaxies at large masses is shaped by halo
mass quenching (likely through shock virial heating and AGN feedback), but
group richness also plays an important role: central galaxies living in less
dense environments quenched their star formation later or did not quench it
yet. At low masses, processes that delay star formation without invoking too
strong supernova-driven outflows could explain the high Ms/Mh ratios of blue
centrals as compared to those of the scarce red centrals.
