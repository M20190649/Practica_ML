An improved map of the Galactic Faraday sky
We aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding Galactic Faraday
rotation in an all-sky map of the Galactic Faraday depth. For this we have
assembled the most extensive catalog of Faraday rotation data of compact
extragalactic polarized radio sources to date. In the map making procedure we
use a recently developed algorithm that reconstructs the map and the power
spectrum of a statistically isotropic and homogeneous field while taking into
account uncertainties in the noise statistics. This procedure is able to
identify some rotation angles that are offset by an integer multiple of pi. The
resulting map can be seen as an improved version of earlier such maps and is
made publicly available, along with a map of its uncertainty. For the angular
power spectrum we find a power law behavior with a power law index of -2.14 for
a Faraday sky where an overall variance profile as a function of Galactic
latitude has been removed, in agreement with earlier work. We show that this is
in accordance with a 3D Fourier power spectrum P(k) proportional to k^-2.14 of
the underlying field n_e times B_r under simplifying geometrical and
statistical assumptions.
