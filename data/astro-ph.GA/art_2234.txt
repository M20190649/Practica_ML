Nuclear Star-Forming Ring of the Milky Way: Simulations
We present hydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in the central kpc region
of the Milky Way that is modeled with a three-dimensional bar potential. Our
simulations consider realistic gas cooling and heating, star formation, and
supernova feedback. A ring of dense gas clouds forms as a result of X1-X2 orbit
transfer, and our potential model results in a ring radius of ~200 pc, which
coincides with the extraordinary reservoir of dense molecular clouds in the
inner bulge, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The gas clouds accumulated in
the CMZ can reach high enough densities to form stars, and with an appropriate
choice of simulation parameters, we successfully reproduce the observed gas
mass and the star formation rate (SFR) in the CMZ, ~2x10^7 Msun and ~0.1
Msun/yr. Star formation in our simulations takes place mostly in the outermost
X2 orbits, and the SFR per unit surface area outside the CMZ is much lower.
These facts suggest that the inner Galactic bulge may harbor a mild version of
the nuclear star-forming rings seen in some external disk galaxies.
Furthermore, from the relatively small size of the Milky Way's nuclear bulge,
which is thought to be a result of sustained star formation in the CMZ, we
infer that the Galactic inner bulge probably had a shallower density profile or
stronger bar elongation in the past.
