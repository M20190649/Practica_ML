Carbon-rich dust production in metal-poor galaxies in the Local Group
We have observed a sample of 19 carbon stars in the Sculptor, Carina, Fornax,
and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Infrared Spectrograph on the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectra show significant quantities of dust around
the carbon stars in Sculptor, Fornax, and Leo I, but little in Carina. Previous
comparisons of carbon stars with similar pulsation properties in the Galaxy and
the Magellanic Clouds revealed no evidence that metallicity affected the
production of dust by carbon stars. However, the more metal-poor stars in the
current sample appear to be generating less dust. These data extend two known
trends to lower metallicities. In more metal-poor samples, the SiC dust
emission weakens, while the acetylene absorption strengthens. The bolometric
magnitudes and infrared spectral properties of the carbon stars in Fornax are
consistent with metallicities more similar to carbon stars in the Magellanic
Clouds than in the other dwarf spheroidals in our sample. A study of the carbon
budget in these stars reinforces previous considerations that the dredge-up of
sufficient quantities of carbon from the stellar cores may trigger the final
superwind phase, ending a star's lifetime on the asymptotic giant branch.
