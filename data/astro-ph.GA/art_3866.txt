Discovery of supernova remnants in the Sino-German 6cm polarization
  survey of the Galactic plane
The Sino-German 6cm polarization survey has mapped in total intensity and
polarization intensity over an area of approximately 2200 square degrees in the
Galactic disk. This survey provides an opportunity to search for Galactic
supernova remnants (SNRs) that were previously unknown. We discovered the new
SNRs G178.2-4.2 and G25.1-2.3 which have non-thermal spectra, using the 6cm
data together with the observations with the Effelsberg telescope at 11 cm and
21 cm. Both G178.2-4.2 and G25.1-2.3 are faint and have an apparent diameter
greater than 1deg. G178.2-4.2 shows a polarized shell. HI data suggest that
G25.1-2.3 might have a distance of about 3 kpc. The 6cm survey data were also
very important to identify two other new SNRs, G152.4-2.1 and G190.9-2.2.
