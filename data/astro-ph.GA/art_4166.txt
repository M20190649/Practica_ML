Unified Models of Molecular Emission from Class 0 Protostellar Outflow
  Sources
Low mass star-forming regions are more complex than the simple spherically
symmetric approximation that is often assumed. We apply a more realistic
infall/outflow physical model to molecular/continuum observations of three late
Class 0 protostellar sources with the aims of (a) proving the applicability of
a single physical model for all three sources, and (b) deriving physical
parameters for the molecular gas component in each of the sources.
  We have observed several molecular species in multiple rotational
transitions. The observed line profiles were modelled in the context of a
dynamical model which incorporates infall and bipolar outflows, using a three
dimensional radiative transfer code. This results in constraints on the
physical parameters and chemical abundances in each source.
  Self-consistent fits to each source are obtained. We constrain the
characteristics of the molecular gas in the envelopes as well as in the
molecular outflows. We find that the molecular gas abundances in the infalling
envelope are reduced, presumably due to freeze-out, whilst the abundances in
the molecular outflows are enhanced, presumably due to dynamical activity.
Despite the fact that the line profiles show significant source-to-source
variation, which primarily derives from variations in the outflow viewing
angle, the physical parameters of the gas are found to be similar in each core.
