The effect of gravitational tides on dwarf spheroidal galaxies
The effect of the local environment on the evolution of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies is poorly understood. We have undertaken a suite of simulations to
investigate the tidal impact of the Milky Way on the chemodynamical evolution
of dwarf spheroidals that resemble present day classical dwarfs using the SPH
code GEAR. After simulating the models through a large parameter space of
potential orbits the resulting properties are compared with observations from
both a dynamical point of view, but also from the, often neglected, chemical
point of view. In general, we find that tidal effects quench the star formation
even inside gas-endowed dwarfs. Such quenching, may produce the radial
distribution of dwarf spheroidals from the orbits seen within large
cosmological simulations. We also find that the metallicity gradient within a
dwarf is gradually erased through tidal interactions as stellar orbits move to
higher radii. The model dwarfs also shift to higher $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$/L
ratios, but only when losing $>$$20\%$ of stellar mass.
