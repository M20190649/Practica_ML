Spatial and Temporal Variations of the Diffuse Iron 6.4 keV Line in the
  Galactic Center Region
We analyze the diffuse Fe I K-alpha line generated in the diffuse
interstellar molecular hydrogen by primary photons or subrelativistic protons
injected by Sagittarius (Sgr) A*. We showed that unlike emission from compact
molecular clouds, this emission can be permanently observed in the directions
of the Galactic center. We conclude that the diffuse emission of 6.4 keV line
observed at present is probably due to Fe I K-alpha vacancy production by
primary photons if the X-ray luminosity of Sgr A* was about Lx ~ 10^39-10^40
erg/s. In principle these data can also be described in the framework of the
model when the 6.4 keV line emission is generated by subrelativistic protons
generated by accretion onto the central black hole but in this case extreme
parameters of this model are necessary.
