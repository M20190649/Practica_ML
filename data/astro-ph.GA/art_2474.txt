A barium-rich binary central star in Abell 70
We have found the central star of Abell 70 (PN G038.1-25.4, hereafter A 70)
to be a binary consisting of a G8 IV-V secondary and a hot white dwarf. The
secondary shows enhanced Ba II and Sr II features, firmly classifying it as a
barium star. The nebula is found to have Type-I chemical abundances with helium
and nitrogen enrichment, which combined with future abundance studies of the
central star, will establish A 70 as a unique laboratory for studying s-process
AGB nucleosynthesis.
