The VMC ESO Public Survey
The VISTA near-infrared YJKs survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC) has
entered its core phase: about 40% of the observations across the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), the Magellanic Bridge and Stream have
already been secured and the data are processed and analysed regularly. The
initial analyses, concentrated in the first two completed tiles in the LMC (6_6
including 30 Doradus and 8_8 including the South Ecliptic Pole), show the
superior quality of the data. The depth of the VMC survey allows the derivation
of the star formation history (SFH) with unprecedented quality compared to
previous wide-area surveys while reddening maps of high angular resolution are
constructed using red clump stars. The multi-epoch Ks-band data reveal tight
period-luminosity relations for variable stars and they permit the measurement
of accurate proper motions of the stellar populations. The VMC survey continues
to acquire data that will address many issues in the field of star and galaxy
evolution.
