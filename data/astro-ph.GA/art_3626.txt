Searching for evidence of jet-cloud interaction in radio galaxies. First
  results for 3C 381
We present results of Gemini spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope imaging
of the 3C~381 radio galaxy. Possible ionising mechanisms for the Extended
Emission-Line Region were studied through state-of-the-art diagnostic analysis
employing line-ratios. Photoionisation from the central engine as well as
mixed-medium photoionisation models fail in reproducing both the strengths and
the behaviour of the highest-excitation lines, such as [NeV]3424, HeII, and
[OIII}]5007, which are measured at very large distances from the AGN.
Shock-ionisation models provide a better fit to the observation. Expanding
shocks with velocities higher than 500 km/s are capable of reaching the
observed intensity ratios for lines with different ionisation states and
excitation degrees. This model also provide a direct explanation of the
mechanical energy input needed to explain the high-velocity line-splitting
observed in the velocity field.
