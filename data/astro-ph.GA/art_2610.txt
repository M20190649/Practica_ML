Trigonometric Parallaxes of Massive Star-Forming Regions. IX. The Outer
  Arm in the First Quadrant
We report a trigonometric parallax measurement with the Very Long Baseline
Array for the water maser in the distant high-mass star-forming region
G75.30+1.32. This source has a heliocentric distance of 9.25+-0.45 kpc, which
places it in the Outer arm in the first Galactic quadrant. It lies 200 pc above
the Galactic plane and is associated with a substantial HI enhancement at the
border of a large molecular cloud. At a Galactocentric radius of 10.7 kpc,
G75.30+1.32 is in a region of the Galaxy where the disk is significantly warped
toward the North Galactic Pole. While the star-forming region has an
instantaneous Galactic orbit that is nearly circular, it displays a significant
motion of 18 km/s toward the Galactic plane. The present results, when combined
with two previous maser studies in the Outer arm, yield a pitch angle of about
12 degrees for a large section of the arm extending from the first quadrant to
the third.
