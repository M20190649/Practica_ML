The hunt for the Milky Way's accreted disc
The Milky Way is expected to host an accreted disc of stars and dark matter.
This forms as massive >1:10 mergers are preferentially dragged towards the disc
plane by dynamical friction and then tidally shredded. The accreted disc likely
contributes only a tiny fraction of the Milky Way's thin and thick stellar
disc. However, it is interesting because: (i) its associated `dark disc' has
important implications for experiments hoping to detect a dark matter particle
in the laboratory; and (ii) the presence or absence of such a disc constrains
the merger history of our Galaxy. In this work, we develop a chemo-dynamical
template to hunt for the accreted disc. We apply our template to the
high-resolution spectroscopic sample from Ruchti et al. (2011), finding at
present no evidence for accreted stars. Our results are consistent with a
quiescent Milky Way with no >1:10 mergers since the disc formed and a
correspondingly light `dark disc'. However, we caution that while our method
can robustly identify accreted stars, our incomplete stellar sample makes it
more challenging to definitively rule them out. Larger unbiased stellar samples
will be required for this.
