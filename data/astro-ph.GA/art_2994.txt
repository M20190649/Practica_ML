Morpho-kinematic analysis of the point-symmetric, bipolar planetary
  nebulae Hb 5 and K 3-17, a pathway to poly-polarity
The kinematics of the bipolar planetary nebulae Hb~5 and K 3-17 are
investigated in detail by means of a comprehensive set of spatially resolved
high spectral resolution, long-slit spectra. Both objects share particularly
interesting characteristics, such as a complex filamentary, rosette-type
nucleus, axial point-symmetry and very fast bipolar outflows. The kinematic
information of Hb~5 is combined with {\it HST} imagery to construct a detailed
3D model of the nebula using the code SHAPE. The model shows that the large
scale lobes are growing in a non-homologous way. The filamentary loops in the
core are proven to actually be secondary lobes emerging from what appears to be
a randomly punctured, dense, gaseous core and the material that forms the point
symmetric structure flows within the lobes with a distinct kinematic pattern
and its interaction with the lobes has had a shaping effect on them. Hb~5 and
K~3-17 may represent a class of fast evolving planetary nebulae that will
develop poly-polar characteristics once the nebular core evolves and expands.
