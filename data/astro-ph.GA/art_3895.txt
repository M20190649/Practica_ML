Atomic Hydrogen in a Galactic Center Outflow
We describe a population of small, high velocity, atomic hydrogen clouds,
loops, and filaments found above and below the disk near the Galactic Center.
The objects have a mean radius of 15 pc, velocity widths of $\sim 14$ km/s and
are observed at $|z|$ heights up to 700 pc. The velocity distribution of the
clouds shows no signature of Galactic rotation. We propose a scenario where the
clouds are associated with an outflow from a central star-forming region at the
Galactic Center. We discuss the clouds as entrained material traveling at $\sim
200$ km/s in a Galactic wind.
