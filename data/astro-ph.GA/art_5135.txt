The Bullet Cluster is not a Cosmological Anomaly
The Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56) merger is of exceptional interest for testing
the standard cold-dark-matter plus cosmological constant cosmological model,
and for investigating the possible existence of a long- or short-range
"fifth-force" in the dark sector and possible need for modifications of general
relativity or even of Newtonian gravity. The most recent previous simulations
of the Bullet Cluster merger required an initial infall velocity far in excess
of what would be expected within the standard cosmological model, at least in
the absence of additional forces or modifications to gravity. We have carried
out much more detailed simulations, making pixel-by-pixel fits to 2D data-maps
of the mass distribution and X-ray emission, allowing for triaxial initial
configurations and including MHD and cooling. Here, we compare the initial
conditions of the Bullet Cluster merger to those in similar-mass merging
clusters in the Horizon cosmological simulation. We conclude that the observed
properties of the Bullet Cluster are completely consistent with Lambda-CDM.
