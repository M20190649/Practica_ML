A new method for reconstructing the density distribution of matter in
  the disks of spiral galaxies from the rotation velocity curve in it
In this paper we propose a new method for reconstructing the surface density
of matter in flat disks of spiral galaxies. The surface density is expressed
through observational rotation velocity curves of visible matter in the disks
of spiral galaxies. The new method is not based on quadrature of special
functions. The found solution is used for processing and analysis of
observational data from several spiral galaxies. The new method can be used to
more accurately estimate the amount of dark matter in spiral galaxies.
