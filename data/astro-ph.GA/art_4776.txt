CCD SDSS gr photometry of poorly studied star clusters in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud
We present for the first time CCD SDSS gr photometry, obtained at the Gemini
South telescope with the GMOS attached, of stars in the field of the poorly
studied star clusters NGC1768, HS85, SL676, NGC2107, NGC2190, and SL866, which
are distributed in the main body of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We applied a
subtraction procedure to statistically clean the cluster CMDs from field star
contamination. In order to disentangle cluster features from those belonging to
their surrounding fields, we applied a subtraction procedure which makes use of
variable cells to reproduce the field star Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) as
closely as possible. We then traced their stellar density radial profiles from
star counts performed over the cleaned field stars dataset and derived their
radii. Using the cleaned cluster CMDs, we estimated ages and metallicities from
matching theoretical isochrones computed for the SDSS system. The studied star
clusters have ages from 0.1 up to 2.0 Gyr and are of slightly metal-poor metal
content ([Fe/H] ~ -0.4 dex).
