The Heliosphere---Blowing in the Interstellar Wind
Measurements of the velocity of interstellar HeI inside of the heliosphere
have been conducted over the past forty years. These historical data suggest
that the ecliptic longitude of the direction of the interstellar flow has
increased at an average rate of about 0.19 degrees per year over time. Possible
astronomical explanations for these short-term variations in the interstellar
gas entering the heliosphere are presented.
