Measuring the Stellar Masses of z~7 Galaxies with Spitzer Ultrafaint
  Survey Program (SURFS UP)
We present Spitzer/IRAC observations of nine $z'$-band dropouts highly
magnified (2<mu<12) by the Bullet Cluster. We combine archival imaging with our
Exploratory program (SURFS UP), which results in a total integration time of
~30 hr per IRAC band. We detect (>3sigma) in both IRAC bands the brightest of
these high-redshift galaxies, with [3.6]=23.80+-0.28 mag, [4.5]=23.78+-0.25
mag, and (H-[3.6])=1.17+-0.32 mag. The remaining eight galaxies are undetected
to [3.6]~26.4 mag and [4.5]~26.0 mag with stellar masses of ~5x10^7 M_sol. The
detected galaxy has an estimated magnification of mu=12+-4, which implies this
galaxy has an ultraviolet luminosity of L_1500~0.3 L*_{z=7} --- the lowest
luminosity individual source detected in IRAC at z>7. By modeling the broadband
photometry, we estimate the galaxy has an intrinsic star-formation rate of
SFR~1.3 M_sol/yr and stellar mass of M~2x10^9 M_sol, which gives a specific
star-formation rate of sSFR~0.7 Gyr^-1. If this galaxy had sustained this
star-formation rate since z~20, it could have formed the observed stellar mass
(to within a factor of ~2), we also discuss alternate star-formation histories
and argue the exponentially-increasing model is unlikely. Finally, based on the
intrinsic star-formation rate, we estimate this galaxy has a likely [C II] flux
of <f_[C II]> = 10^{-17} erg/s/cm2.
