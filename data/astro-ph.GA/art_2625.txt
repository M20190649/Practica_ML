The dynamical fingerprint of gas-expulsion: Insights into the assembly
  of the Milky Ways' old GC system
Since the oldest globular clusters (GCs) are early residuals from the
formation of the Milky Way (MW), GCs were exposed to the likely evolving
potential of our Galaxy. The expulsion of the residual-gas from the GC's
embedded progenitors is sensitive to the conditions in the pre-MW gas cloud. By
means of N-body computations it is shown that gas throw-out from initially
mass-segregated GCs affect the shape of the low-mass stellar mass function (MF)
and that its imprint might still be visible in the present-day MF (PDMF). The
strength of the tidal-field at birth influences the degree of gas-expulsion
driven low-mass-star depletion and therefore the PDMF probes the MW potential
at the time of GC formation. It is argued that among the old GC population in
the MW, younger GCs show stronger low-mass-star loss than older GCs. This is
shown to be consistent with a contracting and self-gravitating cloud in which
fluctuations in the pre-MW potential grow with time. An initially relatively
smooth tidal field evolved into a grainy potential within a dynamical
time-scale of the collapsing cloud (based on Marks & Kroupa 2010, MNRAS, 406,
2000).
