YSO jets in the Galactic Plane from UWISH2: II - Outflow Luminosity and
  Length distributions in Serpens and Aquila
Jets and outflows accompany the mass accretion process in protostars and
young stellar objects. Using a large and unbiased sample, they can be used to
study statistically the local feedback they provide and the typical mass
accretion history. Here we analyse such a sample of Molecular Hydrogen emission
line Objects in the Serpens and Aquila part of the Galactic Plane. Distances
are measured by foreground star counts with an accuracy of 25%. The resulting
spacial distribution and outflow luminosities indicate that our objects sample
the formation of intermediate mass objects. The outflows are unable to provide
a sizeable fraction of energy and momentum to support, even locally, the
turbulence levels in their surrounding molecular clouds. The fraction of parsec
scale flows is one quarter and the typical dynamical jet age of the order of
1E4yrs. Groups of emission knots are ejected every 1E3yrs. This might indicate
that low level accretion rate fluctuations and not FU-Ori type events are
responsible for the episodic ejection of material. Better observational
estimates of the FU-Ori duty cycle are needed.
