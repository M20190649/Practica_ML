The 6-GHz methanol multibeam maser catalogue IV: Galactic longitudes 186
  to 330 including the Orion-Monoceros region
We present the fourth portion of a Galactic Plane survey of methanol masers
at 6668 MHz, spanning the longitude range 186 degrees to 330 degrees. We report
207 maser detections, 89 new to the survey. This completes the southern sky
part of the Methanol Multibeam survey and includes a large proportion of new
sources, 43%. We also include results from blind observations of the
Orion-Monoceros star forming region, formally outside the latitude range of the
Methanol Multibeam survey; only the four previously known methanol emitting
sites were detected, of which we present new positions and spectra for masers
at Orion-A (south) and Orion-B, obtained with the MERLIN array.
