Internal Motion of 6.7-GHz Methanol Masers in H II Region S269
We present the first internal motion measurement of the 6.7-GHz methanol
maser within S269, a small HII region in the outer Galaxy, which was carried
out in 2006 and 2011 using the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN). Several maser
groups and weak isolated spots were detected in an area spanning by ~200 mas
(1000 AU). Three remarkable maser groups are aligned at a position angle of 80
degree. Two of three maser groups were also detected by a previous observation
in 1998, which allowed us to study a long-term position variation of maser
spots from 1998 to 2011. The angular separation between the two groups
increased ~10 mas, which corresponds to an expansion velocity of ~10 km s^{-1}.
Some velocity gradient (~10^{-2} km s^{-1} mas^{-1}) in the overall
distribution was found. The internal motion between the maser groups support
the hypothesis that the methanol masers in S269 could trace a bipolar outflow.
