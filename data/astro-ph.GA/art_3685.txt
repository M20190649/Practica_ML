Simulations of the origin and fate of the Galactic Center cloud G2
We investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud G2
close to the Galactic Center. Our hydrodynamical simulations focussing on the
dynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently available
observations favour two scenarios: a Compact Cloud which started around the
year 1995 and an extended Spherical Shell of gas, with an apocenter distance
within the disk(s) of young stars. The former is able to explain the detected
signal of G2 in the position-velocity-diagram of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5
data. The latter can account for both, G2's signal as well as the fainter
extended tail-like structure G2t seen at larger distances to the black hole and
smaller velocities. From these first idealised simulations we expect a rise of
the current activity of Sgr A* shortly after the closest approach and a
constant feeding through a nozzle-like structure over a long period. The near
future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of the conditions of
the gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of the massive black hole
in the Galactic Center and will also give us invaluable information of the
feeding of black holes and the activation of the central source.
