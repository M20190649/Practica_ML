Weak and Extended H2 Emission in NGC 6369
NGC 6369 is a double-shell PN with a filamentary outer shell or envelope and
faint bipolar extensions. We have used ground- and space-based narrowband
optical and near-IR images, broadband mid-IR images, optical long-slit echelle
spectra, and mid-IR spectra to investigate its physical structure. The
observations confirm a bipolar structure for the inner shell of NGC 6369, but
they also reveal evidence for H2 and strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) emission from a photo-dissociation region (PDR) with molecular
inclusions located outside the bright inner shell.
