Two new ultra-cool benchmark systems from WISE+2MASS
We have used the 2MASS all-sky survey and the WISE to look for ultracool
dwarfs that are part of multiple systems containing main sequence stars. We
cross-matched L dwarf candidates from the surveys with Hipparcos and Gliese
stars, finding two new systems. The first system, G255-34AB is an L2 dwarf
companion to a K8 star, at a distance of 36 pc. We estimate its bolometric
luminosity as log (L/Lsolar) = -3.78 +/- 0.045 and Teff = 2080 +/- 260 K. The
second system, GJ499ABC, is a triple, with an L5 dwarf as a companion to a
binary with an M4 and K5 star. These two new systems bring the number of L
dwarf plus main sequence star multiple systems to twenty four, which we
discuss. We consider the binary fraction for L dwarfs and main sequence stars,
and further assess possible unresolved multiplicity within the full companion
sample. This analysis shows that some of the L dwarfs in this sample might
actually be unresolved binaries themselves, since their MJ appears to be
brighter than the expected for their spectral types.
