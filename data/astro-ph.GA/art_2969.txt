Molecules in Î· Carinae
We report the detection toward \eta\ Carinae of six new molecules, CO, CN,
HCO+, HCN, HNC, and N2H+, and of two of their less abundant isotopic
counterparts, 13CO and H13CN. The line profiles are moderately broad (about 100
km /s) indicating that the emission originates in the dense, possibly clumpy,
central arcsecond of the Homunculus Nebula. Contrary to previous claims, CO and
HCO+ do not appear to be under-abundant in \eta\ Carinae. On the other hand,
molecules containing nitrogen or the 13C isotope of carbon are overabundant by
about one order of magnitude. This demonstrates that, together with the dust
responsible for the dimming of eta Carinae following the Great Eruption, the
molecules detected here must have formed in situ out of CNO-processed stellar
material.
