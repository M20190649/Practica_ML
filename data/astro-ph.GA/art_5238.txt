Champagne Flutes and Brandy Snifters: Modelling Protostellar
  Outflow-Cloud Chemical Interfaces
A rich variety of molecular species has now been observed towards hot cores
in star forming regions and in the interstellar medium. An increasing body of
evidence from millimetre interferometers suggests that many of these form at
the interfaces between protostellar outflows and their natal molecular clouds.
However, current models have remained unable to explain the origin of the
observational bias towards wide-angled "brandy snifter" shaped outflows over
narrower "champagne flute" shapes in carbon monoxide imaging. Furthermore,
these wide-angled systems exhibit unusually high abundances of the molecular
ion HCO$^+$. We present results from a chemo-dynamic model of such regions
where a rich chemistry arises naturally as a result of turbulent mixing between
cold, dense molecular gas and the hot, ionized outflow material. The injecta
drives a rich and rapid ion-neutral chemistry in qualitative and quantitative
agreement with the observations. The observational bias towards wide-angled
outflows is explained naturally by the geometry-dependent ion injection rate
causing rapid dissociation of CO in the younger systems.
