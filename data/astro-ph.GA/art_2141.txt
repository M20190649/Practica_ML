The Southern Proper Motion Program IV. The SPM4 Catalog
We present the fourth installment of the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion
Catalog, SPM4. The SPM4 contains absolute proper motions, celestial
coordinates, and (B,V) photometry for over 103 million stars and galaxies
between the south celestial pole and -20 deg declination. The catalog is
roughly complete to V=17.5 and is based on photographic and CCD observations
taken with the Yale Southern Observatory's double-astrograph at Cesco
Observatory in El Leoncito, Argentina. The proper-motion precision, for
well-measured stars, is estimated to be 2 to 3 mas/yr, depending on the type of
second-epoch material. At the bright end, proper motions are on the
International Celestial Reference System by way of Hipparcos Catalog stars,
while the faint end is anchored to the inertial system using external galaxies.
Systematic uncertainties in the absolute proper motions are on the order of 1
mas/yr.
