Reactions forming C(0,+)n=2,10, Cn=2,4H(0,+) and C3H(0,+) in the gas
  phase: semi empirical branching ratios
The aim of this paper is to provide a new set of branching ratios for
interstellar and planetary chemical networks based on a semi empirical model.
We applied, instead of zero order theory (i.e. only the most exoergic decaying
channel is considered), a statistical microcanonical model based on the
construction of breakdown curves and using experimental high velocity collision
branching ratios for their parametriza- tion. We applied the model to
ion-molecule, neutral-neutral, and ion-pair reactions implemented in the few
popular databases for astrochemistry such as KIDA, OSU and UMIST. We studied
the reactions of carbon and hydrocarbon species with electrons, He+, H+, CH+,
CH, C, and C+ leading to intermediate complexes of the type Cn=2,10, Cn=2,4 H,
C3 H2, C+n=2,10, Cn=2,4 H+, or C3 H+2 . Comparison of predictions with
measurements supports the validity of the model. Huge deviations with respect
to database values are often obtained. Effects of the new branching ratios in
time dependant chemistry for dark clouds and for photodissociation region
chemistry with conditions similar to those found in the Horsehead Nebula are
discussed.
