The long bar as seen by the VVV Survey: II. Star counts
Context: There is still some debate about the presence and the morphological
properties of the long bar in the inner Galaxy.
  Aims: We investigate the morphological properties of the long Galactic bar
using the VVV survey extending star counts at least 3 mag deeper than 2MASS.
Our study covers the relatively unexplored negative longitudes of the Galactic
bar. We obtain a detailed description of the spatial distribution of star
counts towards the long Galactic bar as well as to measure its parameters.
  Methods: We performed star counts towards -20<l<0 deg., |b|< 2 deg. using
VVV, 2MASS, and GLIMPSE data. We applied an average interstellar extinction
correction. We also adjusted latitudinal profiles to obtain the centroid
variation and bar thickness.
  Results: We probe the structure of long Galactic bar, as well as its far edge
at l=-14 deg. The differences between counts with and without extinction
correction allow us to produce a crude extinction map showing regions with high
extinction, mainly beyond the end of long Galactic bar. The latitudinal
profiles show evidence of the centroid vertical variation with Galactic
longitude reaching a minimum at l=-13.8 deg. The bar has an inclination angle
43+/-5 deg with respect to the line Sun-Galactic center. In addition, we have
determined the bar parameters, such as thickness, length, and stellar
distribution.
