NGC 2419 does not challenge MOND
I show that, in the context of MOND, non-isothermal models, approximated by
high order polytropic spheres, are consistent with the observations of the
radial distribution of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the distant
globular cluster, NGC 2419. This calls into question the claim by Ibata et al.
that the object constitutes a severe challenge for MOND. In general, the
existence and properties of globular clusters are more problematic for LCDM
than for MOND.
