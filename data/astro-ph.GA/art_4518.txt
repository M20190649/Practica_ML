Detection of Class I Methanol (CH3OH) Maser Candidates in Supernova
  Remnants
We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to search for 36 GHz
and 44 GHz methanol (CH3OH) lines in a sample of 21 Galactic supernova remnants
(SNRs). Mainly the regions of the SNRs with 1720 MHz OH masers were observed.
Despite the limited spatial extent covered in our search, methanol masers were
detected in both G1.4-0.1 and W28. Additional masers were found in SgrAEast.
More than 40 masers were found in G1.4-0.1 which we deduce are due to
interactions between the SNR and at least two separate molecular clouds. The
six masers in W28 are associated with the molecular cloud that is also
associated with the OH maser excitation. We discuss the possibility that the
methanol maser may be more numerous in SNRs than the OH maser, but harder to
detect due to observational constraints.
