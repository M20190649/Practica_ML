Comments on the paper `Unifying Boxy Bulge and Planar Long Bar in the
  Milky Way' by Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard [arXiv:1105.0928]
We comment on the recent paper by Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard
(arXiv:1105.0928, 2011), who suggest, as an alternative to the bulge + long bar
hypothesis in the inner 4 kpc of our Galaxy, a single boxy-bulge structure with
a twisted major axis. In principle, we find this proposal acceptable; indeed,
from a purely morphological point of view, this is more a question of semantics
than science, and possibly all of us are talking about the same thing. However,
we think that the particular features of this new proposal of a "single twisted
bulge/bar" scenario leaves certain observational facts unexplained, whereas the
model of a misaligned bulge + long bar successfully explains them.
