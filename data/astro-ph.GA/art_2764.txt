The enigma of jets and outflows from young stars
Research in recent decades has seen many important advances in understanding
the role of jets and outflows in the star formation process. Although, many
open issues still remain, multi-wavelength high resolution observations have
provided unprecedented insights into these bizarre phenomena. An overview of
some of the current research is given, in which great strides have been made in
addressing fundamental questions such as: how are jets generated? what is the
jet acceleration mechanism? how are jets collimated? what is the relationship
between accretion and ejection? how does mass accretion proceed? do jets
somehow extract angular momentum? and finally, is there a universal mechanism
for jet generation on all scales from brown dwarfs to AGNs?
