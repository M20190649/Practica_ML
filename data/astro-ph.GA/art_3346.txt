Clustered Star Formation: A Review
In this contribution I present a review of star formation in clusters. I
begin by discussing the various definitions of what constitutes a star cluster,
and then compare the outcome of star formation (IMF, multiplicity, mass
segregation and structure and morphology) in different star-forming regions. I
also review recent numerical models of star formation in clusters, before
ending with a summary of the potential effects of dynamical evolution in star
clusters.
