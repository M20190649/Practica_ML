The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey IX: Data Release 2 and Outer Galaxy
  Extension
We present a re-reduction and expansion of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey,
first presented by Aguirre et al. (2011) and Rosolowsky et al. (2010). The BGPS
is a 1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern galactic plane, covering
longitudes -10 < \ell < 90 and latitudes |b| < 0.5 with a typical 1-\sigma RMS
sensitivity of 30-100 mJy in a 33" beam. Version 2 of the survey includes an
additional 20 square degrees of coverage in the 3rd and 4th quadrants and 2
square degrees in the 1st quadrant. The new data release has improved angular
recovery, with complete recovery out to 80" and partial recovery to 300", and
reduced negative bowls around bright sources resulting from the atmospheric
subtraction process. We resolve the factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset
between the v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine that there is
no offset between v2.0 and other data sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is
tested against other surveys and demonstrated to be accurate and an improvement
over v1.0. We present simulations and tests of the pipeline and its properties,
including measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer function. The Bolocat
cataloging tool was used to extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
with 591 in the expanded regions. We have demonstrated that the Bolocat 40" and
80" apertures are accurate even in the presence of strong extended background
emission. The number of sources is lower than in v1.0, but the amount of flux
and area included in identified sources is larger.
