Does the stellar distribution flare? A comparison of stellar scale
  heights with LAB HI data
The question, whether the stellar populations in the Milky Way take part in
flaring of the scale heights as observed for the HI gas is a matter of debate.
Standard mass models for the Milky Way assume a constant scale height for each
of the different stellar distributions. However, there is mounting evidence
that at least some of the stellar distributions reach at large galactocentric
distances high altitudes that are incompatible with a constant scale height. We
discuss recent observational evidence for stellar flaring and compare it with
HI data from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey. Within the systemic and
statistical uncertainties we find a good agreement between both.
