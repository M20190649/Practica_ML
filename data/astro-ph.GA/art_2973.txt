High-resolution absorption spectroscopy of the OH 2Pi 3/2 ground state
  line
The chemical composition of the interstellar medium is determined by gas
phase chemistry, assisted by grain surface reactions, and by shock chemistry.
The aim of this study is to measure the abundance of the hydroxyl radical (OH)
in diffuse spiral arm clouds as a contribution to our understanding of the
underlying network of chemical reactions. Owing to their high critical density,
the ground states of light hydrides provide a tool to directly estimate column
densities by means of absorption spectroscopy against bright background
sources. We observed onboard the SOFIA observatory the 2Pi3/2, J = 5/2 3/2 2.5
THz line of ground-state OH in the diffuse clouds of the Carina-Sagittarius
spiral arm. OH column densities in the spiral arm clouds along the sightlines
to W49N, W51 and G34.26+0.15 were found to be of the order of 10^14 cm^-2,
which corresponds to a fractional abundance of 10^-7 to 10^-8, which is
comparable to that of H_2O. The absorption spectra of both species have similar
velocity components, and the ratio of the derived H_2O to OH column densities
ranges from 0.3 to 1.0. In W49N we also detected the corresponding line of
^18OH.
