Diffuse interstellar bands as probes of small-scale interstellar
  structure
We present observations which probe the small-scale structure of the
interstellar medium using diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Towards HD
168075/6 in the Eagle Nebula, significant differences in DIB absorption are
found between the two lines of sight, which are separated by 0.25 pc, and
{\lambda}5797 exhibits a velocity shift. Similar data are presented for four
stars in the {\mu} Sgr system. We also present a search for variations in DIB
absorption towards {\kappa} Vel, where the atomic lines are known to vary on
scales of ~10 AU. Observations separated by ~9 yr yielded no evidence for
changes in DIB absorption strength over this scale, but do reveal an unusual
DIB spectrum.
