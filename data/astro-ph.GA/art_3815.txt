Discovery of four water masers in the Small Magellanic Cloud
We report the detection of four water masers within the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC); two discovered with the 70-m Tidbinbilla radio telescope, and two
discovered with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Precise positions
of all four masers have been derived from ATCA observations, and the
characteristics of each water maser have been monitored over a period of
several years. Sensitive observations towards two previously detected water
masers reported in the literature failed to detect any emission. The detected
water masers show evidence of higher levels of temporal variability than
equivalent Galactic sources, and one of the features associated with NGC346 IR1
shows an acceleration of 9.6 km/s yr^-1 over a 31 day period. Sensitive
targeted observations for methanol and OH masers failed to detect any
accompanying emission - in the case of methanol perhaps highlighting an under
abundance in the SMC, consistent with expectations due to lower metallicity.
  The water masers are both bright and compact making them excellent targets
for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, which can
potentially measure the proper motion of the SMC (~1 - 2 mas yr^-1) with
temporal baselines of ~12 months. Such observations would utilise sources
associated with only the current epoch of star formation and hence have several
advantages over alternative methods.
