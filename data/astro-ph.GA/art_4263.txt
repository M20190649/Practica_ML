Magnetic field generation in galactic molecular clouds
We investigate the magnetic field which is generated by turbulent motions of
a weakly ionized gas. Galactic molecular clouds give us an example of such a
medium. As in the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model we assume a medium to be
homogeneous and a neutral gas velocity field to be isotropic and
delta-correlated in time. We take into consideration the presence of a mean
magnetic field, which defines a preferred direction in space and eliminates
isotropy of magnetic field correlators. Evolution equations for the anisotropic
correlation function are derived. Isotropic cases with zero mean magnetic field
as well as with small mean magnetic field are investigated. It is shown that
stationary bounded solutions exist only in the presence of the mean magnetic
field for the Kolmogorov neutral gas turbulence. The dependence of the magnetic
field fluctuations amplitude on the mean field is calculated. The stationary
anisotropic solution for the magnetic turbulence is also obtained for large
values of the mean magnetic field.
