The Effect of Stellar Metallicity on the Sizes of Star Clusters
Observations indicate blue globular clusters have half-light radii
systematically larger than those of red globular clusters. In this paper, we
test whether the different metallicity-dependent stellar evolution timescales
and mass-loss rates within the clusters can impact their early dynamical
evolution. By means of N-body simulations including stellar evolution recipes
we simulate the early evolution of small centrally concentrated clusters with
and without primordial mass segregation. Our simulations include accurate
metallicity-dependent mass loss from massive stars. We find blue clusters to be
larger than red clusters regardless of whether the clusters have been
primordially mass segregated. In addition, the size difference is found to be
larger and consistent with observations for initial models with a low central
concentration. These results indicate that the systematic size difference found
between red and blue clusters can, at least in part, be attributed to the
dynamical effects of differing stellar evolution histories, driven by
metallicity.
