Young stellar groups in M 33 galaxy: delineation and main parameters
The problem of (non-)existence of a typical size of the stellar associations
is revisited by use of deep UBVRI stellar CCD photometry in M 33 from the Local
Group Survey (Massey et al. 2006). We compare the outlines of the `classical OB
associations' (Ivanov 1991) with stellar groups that were selected through an
objective method for determination of the local stellar density and
delineation. Main parameters of some stellar groups like size, shape and
density concentrations are determined.
