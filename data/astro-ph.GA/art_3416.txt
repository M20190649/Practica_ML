Made-to-measure galaxy models - III Modelling with Milky Way
  observations
We demonstrate how the Syer & Tremaine made-to-measure method of stellar
dynamical modelling can be adapted to model a rotating galactic bar. We
validate our made-to-measure changes using observations constructed from the
existing Shen et al. (2010) N-body model of the Milky Way bar, together with
kinematic observations of the Milky Way bulge and bar taken by the Bulge Radial
Velocity Assay (BRAVA). Our results for a combined determination of the bar
angle and bar pattern speed (~30 degrees and ~40 km/s/kpc) are consistent with
those determined by the N-body model. Whilst the made-to-measure techniques we
have developed are applied using a particular N-body model and observational
data set, they are in fact general and could be applied to other Milky Way
modelling scenarios utilising different N-body models and data sets.
Additionally, we use the exercise as a vehicle for illustrating how N-body and
made-to-measure methods might be combined into a more effective method.
