SNR G349.7+0.2: A gamma-ray source in the far 3 kpc arm of the Galactic
  center
We analyze the HI absorption profile for TeV Supernova Remnant (SNR)
G349.7+0.2 based on updated knowledge of the inner Galaxy's structure. We
significantly revise its kinematic distance from the previous ~ 22 kpc to ~11.5
kpc, indicating it is in the far 3 kpc arm of the Galactic center. We give a
revised age of ~ 1800 year for G349.7+0.2 which has a low explosion energy of ~
2.5 x 10^50 ergs. This removes G349.7+0.2 from the set of brightest SNRs in
radio, X-ray to gamma-ray wavebands and helps understand gamma-ray emission
originating from this remnant better. However, one needs to use caution for old
kinematic distances of Galactic objects (e.g. SNRs, Pulsars and HII regions) in
the range of -12 degree =< l =< 12 degree and having distance estimates of >=
5.5 kpc.
