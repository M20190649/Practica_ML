Misaligned streamers around a galactic centre black hole from a single
  cloud's infall
We follow the near radial infall of a prolate cloud onto a 4 x 10^6 Msun
supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that a prolate cloud oriented perpendicular to its
orbital plane naturally produces a spread in angular momenta in the gas which
can translate into misaligned discs as is seen in the young stars orbiting
Sagittarius A*. A turbulent or otherwise highly structured cloud is necessary
to avoid cancelling too much angular momentum through shocks at closest
approach. Our standard model of a 2 x 10^4 Msun gas cloud brought about the
formation of a disc within 0.3 pc from the black hole and a larger, misaligned
streamer at 0.5 pc. A total of 1.5 x 10^4 Msun of gas formed these structures.
Our exploration of the simulation parameter space showed that when star
formation occurred, it resulted in top-heavy IMFs with stars on eccentric
orbits with semi-major axes 0.02 to 0.3 pc and inclinations following the gas
discs and streamers. We suggest that the single event of an infalling prolate
cloud can explain the occurrence of multiple misaligned discs of young stars.
