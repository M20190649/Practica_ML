Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo A Bayesian Approach to Statistical Mechanics
Since the middle of the 1940's scientists have used Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations to obtain information about physical processes. This has proved a
accurate and and reliable method to obtain this information. Through out resent
years researchers has begone to use the slightly newer Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulation. This differs from the ordinary MC by using the Markov Chain.
MCMC originates from Bayesian statistics. This method has given researchers a
completely new tool to learn something about physical systems. One of the
fields where MCMC is a good new tool, is astrophysics. Today MCMC is widely
used in simulating power spectra for asteroseismic data. Hereby providing the
scientists with important new information of stellar interiors. From our
results we see that MCMC delivers a robust and reliable result with good error
estimation. We also learn that MCMC is a power full tool which can be applied
to a large verity of problems.
