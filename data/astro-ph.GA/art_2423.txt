Evolution of growing black holes in axisymmetric galaxy cores
NBody realizations of axisymmetric collisional galaxy cores (e.g. M32, M33,
NGC205, Milky Way) with embedded growing black holes are presented. Stars which
approach the disruption sphere are disrupted and accreted to the black hole. We
measure the zone of influence of the black hole and disruption rates in
relaxation time scales. We show that secular gravitational instabilities
dominate the initial core dynamics, while the black hole is small and growing
due to consumption of stars. Later, the black hole potential dominates the
core, and loss cone theory can be applied. Our simulations show that central
rotation in galaxies can not be neglected for relaxed systems, and compare and
discuss our results with the standard theory of spherically symmetric systems.
