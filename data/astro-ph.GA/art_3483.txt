Status and results from the RAVE survey
RAVE, the RAdial Velocity Experiment, is a large spectroscopic survey which
collects spectroscopic data for stars in the southern hemisphere. RAVE uses the
AAO Schmidt telescope with a wavelength coverage similar to Gaia but a lower
resolution of R=7,500. Since 2003, RAVE collected over 500,000 spectra
providing an unprecedented dataset to study the structure and kinematics of the
Milky Way and its stellar populations. In this review, we will summarize the
main results obtained using the RAVE catalogues.
