An observational investigation of the identity of B11244
  ($l$-C$_3$H$^+$/C$_3$H$^-$)
Pety et al. (2012) have reported the detection of eight transitions of a
closed-shell, linear molecule (B11244) in observations toward the Horsehead
PDR, which they attribute to the $l$-C$_3$H$^+$ cation. Recent high-level
\textit{ab initio} calculations have called this assignment into question; the
anionic C$_3$H$^-$ molecule has been suggested as a more likely candidate.
Here, we examine observations of the Horsehead PDR, Sgr B2(N), TMC-1, and
IRC+10216 in the context of both $l$-C$_3$H$^+$ and C$_3$H$^-$. We find no
observational evidence of $K_a = 1$ lines which should be present were the
carrier indeed C$_3$H$^-$. Additionally, we find a strong anti-correlation
between the presence of known molecular anions and B11244 in these regions.
Finally, we discuss the formation and destruction chemistry of C$_3$H$^-$ in
the context of the physical conditions in the regions. Based on these results,
we conclude there is little evidence to support the carrier is C$_3$H$^-$.
