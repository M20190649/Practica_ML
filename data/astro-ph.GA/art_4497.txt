Abundances of stars in different Galactic subsystems
This is a brief overview of the elemental abundance patterns that have been
observed in the different Galactic stellar populations. Main focus is on
studies that are based on high-resolution spectra of dwarf and subgiant stars,
and in some cases red giant stars. Of particular interest is the thin-thick
disk dichotomy, the variation of abundances and stellar ages with
galactocentric radius, multiple stellar populations in the Galactic bulge
region, and how some of these may be connected with other Galactic populations.
