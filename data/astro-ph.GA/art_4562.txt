Three low surface brightness dwarfs discovered around NGC 4631
We report the discovery of three low surface brightness companions to the
spiral galaxy NGC 4631, made with small amateur telescopes. Assuming their
distances to be 7.4 Mpc, the same as that of NGC 4631, the absolute magnitudes
and linear diameters of the dwarfs are ranged within [-12.5, -9.6] mag and [4.7
- 1.3] kpc, respectively. These new three dwarfs, together with the discovered
by us diffuse structure called "bridge", look like parts of a tidal filament
directed towards NGC 4656 at total extended over 100 kpc.
