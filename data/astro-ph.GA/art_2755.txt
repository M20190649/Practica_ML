Towards a self-consistent numerical model of late-type galaxies:
  Calibrating the effects of sub-grid physics on galactic models
We carry out several isolated galaxy evolution simulations in a fixed dark
matter halo gravitational potential using the new version of our
N-body/Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code GCD+. The new code allows us
to more accurately model and follow the evolution of the gas and stellar
components of the system including powerful supernovae feedback and its effects
on the inter-stellar medium (ISM). Here we present the results of six
simulations of an M33-sized late-type disc galaxy each with varying values for
our model parameters which include the star formation efficiency (C*), the
energy released per supernovae explosion (E_SN) and the energy released per
unit time from stellar winds (E_SW). We carry out both a pixel-by-pixel and
radial ring analysis method for each of our galaxies comparing our results to
the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt Law and vertical gas velocity dispersion versus
radius relation amongst others. We find that our models with higher feedback
more closely resemble the observations and that feedback plays a pivotal role
in obtaining both the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt and gas velocity dispersion
relations.
