The brightness temperatures of the main Galactic radio-loops at 22 MHz
The average brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses at 22 MHz are
derived for the four main Galactic radio-continuum loops (Loops I, II, III and
IV, hereafter radio-loops). Also the radio-continuum spectra for the
radio-loops are presented. Adding the average brightness temperatures at 22 MHz
derived here with the average brightness temperatures derived from spectra
published previously at 408, 820 and 1420 MHz we obtained clearly non-thermal
spectral indices for all radio-loops. Our derived spectral indices are slightly
shallower than those measured by previous works.
