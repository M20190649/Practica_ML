Cloud and Star Formation in Spiral Arms
We present the results from simulations of GMC formation in spiral galaxies.
First we discuss cloud formation by cloud-cloud collisions, and gravitational
instabilities, arguing that the former is prevalent at lower galactic surface
densities and the latter at higher. Cloud masses are also limited by stellar
feedback, which can be effective before clouds reach their maximum mass. We
show other properties of clouds in simulations with different levels of
feedback. With a moderate level of feedback, properties such as cloud rotations
and virial parameters agree with observations. Without feedback, an unrealistic
population of overly bound clouds develops. Spiral arms are not found to
trigger star formation, they merely gather gas into more massive GMCs. We
discuss in more detail interactions of clouds in the ISM, and argue that these
are more complex than early ideas of cloud-cloud collisions. Finally we show
ongoing work to determine whether the Milky Way is a flocculent or grand design
spiral.
