Quantitative Evidence for an Intrinsic Age Spread in the Orion Nebula
  Cluster
Aims. We present a study of the distribution of stellar ages in the Orion
Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on accurate HST photometry taken from the HST
Treasury Program observations of the ONC utilizing the most recent estimate of
the cluster's distance (Menten et al. 2007). We investigate the presence of an
intrinsic age spread in the region and a possible trend of age with the spatial
distribution. Methods. We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity
towards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical
calibration of atmospheric models (Da Rio et al. 2010) using the package
Chorizos (Maiz-Apellaniz 2004). The position of the sources in the HR-diagram
is compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster
age and age dispersion. Through Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the amount
of intrinsic age spread in the region, taking into account uncertainties on the
distance, spectral type, extinction, unresolved binaries, accretion and
photometric variability. Results. According to Siess et al. (2000) evolutionary
models the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myrs. With
Monte Carlo simulations we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent
with a coeval stellar population, but is in agreement with a star formation
activity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myrs. We also observe light evidence for a trend
of ages with spatial distribution.
