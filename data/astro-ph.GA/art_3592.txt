The Abundance, Ortho/Para Ratio, and Deuteration of Water in the
  High-Mass Star Forming Region NGC 6334 I
We present Herschel/HIFI observations of 30 transitions of water
isotopologues toward the high-mass star forming region NGC 6334 I. The line
profiles of H_2^{16}O, H_2^{17}O, H_2^{18}O, and HDO show a complex pattern of
emission and absorption components associated with the embedded hot cores, a
lower-density envelope, two outflow components, and several foreground clouds,
some associated with the NGC 6334 complex, others seen in projection against
the strong continuum background of the source. Our analysis reveals an H2O
ortho/para ratio of 3 +/- 0.5 in the foreground clouds, as well as the outflow.
The water abundance varies from ~10^{-8} in the foreground clouds and the outer
envelope to ~10^{-6} in the hot core. The hot core abundance is two orders of
magnitude below the chemical model predictions for dense, warm gas, but within
the range of values found in other Herschel/HIFI studies of hot cores and hot
corinos. This may be related to the relatively low gas and dust temperature
(~100 K), or time dependent effects, resulting in a significant fraction of
water molecules still locked up in dust grain mantles. The HDO/H_2O ratio in
NGC 6334 I, ~2 10^{-4}, is also relatively low, but within the range found in
other high-mass star forming regions.
