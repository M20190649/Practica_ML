Identifying Blue Horizontal Branch Stars Using the z Filter
In this paper we present a new method for selecting blue horizontal branch
(BHB) candidates based on color-color photometry. We make use of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey z band as a surface gravity indicator and show its value for
selecting BHB stars from quasars, white dwarfs and main sequence A type stars.
Using the g, r, i, and z bands, we demonstrate that extraction accuracies on
par with more traditional u, g, and r photometric selection methods may be
achieved. We also show that the completeness necessary to probe major Galactic
structure may be maintained. Our new method allows us to efficiently select BHB
stars from photometric sky surveys that do not include a u band filter such as
the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System.
