Clustered star formation and outflows in AFGL 2591
We report on a detailed study of the water maser kinematics and radio
continuum emission toward the most massive and young object in the star-forming
region AFGL 2591. Our analysis shows at least two spatial scales of multiple
star formation, one projected across 0.1 pc on the sky and another one at about
2000 AU from a ZAMS star of about 38 Solar masses. This young stellar object
drives a powerful jet- and wind-driven outflow system with the water masers
associated to the outflow walls, previously detected as a limb-brightened
cavity in the NIR band. At about 1300 AU to the north of this object a younger
protostar drives two bow shocks, outlined by arc-like water maser emission, at
200 AU either side of the source. We have traced the velocity profile of the
gas that expands along these arc-like maser structures and compared it with the
jet-driven outflow model. This analysis suggests that the ambient medium around
the northern protostar is swept up by a jet-driven shock (>66 km/s) and perhaps
a lower-velocity (~10 km/s) wind with an opening angle of about 20 degrees from
the jet axis.
