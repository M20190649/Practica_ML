Transformations between WISE and 2MASS, SDSS, BVI photometric systems:
  II. Transformation equations for red clump stars
We present colour transformations for the conversion of the Wide-Field Survey
Explorer (WISE) W1, W2, and W3 magnitudes to the Johnson-Cousins (BVIc), Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (gri), and Two Micron All Sky Survey JHKs photometric
systems, for red clump (RC) stars. RC stars were selected from the Third Radial
Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release (DR3). The apparent magnitudes were
collected by matching the coordinates of this sample with different photometric
catalogues. The final sample (355 RC stars) used to obtain metallicity
dependent-and free of metallicity- transformations between WISE and
Johnson-Cousins, SDSS, 2MASS photometric systems. These transformations
combined with known absolute magnitudes at shorter wavelengths can be used in
space density determinations for the Galactic (thin and thick) discs at
distances larger than the ones evaluated with JHKs photometry alone, hence
providing a powerful tool in the analysis of Galactic structure.
