The Green Bank Telescope H II Region Discovery Survey: IV. Helium and
  Carbon Recombination Lines
The Green Bank Telescope H II Region Discovery Survey (GBT HRDS) found
hundreds of previously unknown Galactic regions of massive star formation by
detecting hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) emission from candidate H II
region targets. Since the HRDS nebulae lie at large distances from the Sun,
they are located in previously unprobed zones of the Galactic disk. Here we
derive the properties of helium and carbon RRL emission from HRDS nebulae. Our
target sample is the subset of the HRDS that has visible helium or carbon RRLs.
This criterion gives a total of 84 velocity components (14% of the HRDS) with
helium emission and 52 (9%) with carbon emission. For our highest quality
sources, the average ionic He-4+/H+ abundance ratio by number, <y+>, is 0.068
+/- 0.023 (1-sigma). This is the same ratio as that measured for the sample of
previously known Galactic H II regions. Nebulae without detected helium
emission give robust y+ upper limits. There are 5 RRL emission components with
y+ less than 0.04 and another 12 with upper limits below this value. These H II
regions must have either a very low He-4 abundance or contain a significant
amount of neutral helium. The HRDS has 20 nebulae with carbon RRL emission but
no helium emission at its sensitivity level. There is no correlation between
the carbon RRL parameters and the 8 microns mid-infrared morphology of these
nebulae.
