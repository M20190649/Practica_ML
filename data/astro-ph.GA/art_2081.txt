Ionization of the diffuse gas in galaxies: Hot low-mass evolved stars at
  work
We revisit the question of the ionization of the diffuse medium in late type
galaxies, by studying NGC 891, the prototype of edge-on spiral galaxies. The
most important challenge for the models considered so far was the observed
increase of [OIII]/Hbeta, [OII]/Hbeta, and [NII]/Halpha with increasing
distance to the galactic plane. We propose a scenario based on the expected
population of massive OB stars and hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) in this
galaxy to explain this observational fact. In the framework of this scenario we
construct a finely meshed grid of photoionization models. For each value of the
galactic latitude z we look for the models which simultaneously fit the
observed values of the [OIII]/Hbeta, [OII]/Hbeta, and [NII]/Halpha ratios. For
each value of z we find a range of solutions which depends on the value of the
oxygen abundance. The models which fit the observations indicate a systematic
decrease of the electron density with increasing z. They become dominated by
the HOLMES with increasing z only when restricting to solar oxygen abundance
models, which argues that the metallicity above the galactic plane should be
close to solar. They also indicate that N/O increases with increasing z.
