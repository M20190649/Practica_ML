Ionized Gas Kinematics at High Resolution IV: Star Formation and a
  Rotating Core in the Medusa (NGC 4194)
NGC 4194 is a post-merger starburst known as The Medusa for its striking
tidal features. We present here a detailed study of the structure and
kinematics of ionized gas in the central 0.65 kpc of the Medusa. The data
include radio continuum maps with resolution up to $0.18\arcsec$ (35 pc) and a
$12.8\mu$m [NeII] data cube with spectral resolution $\sim4$\kms: the first
{\it high resolution, extinction-free} observations of this remarkable object.
The ionized gas has the kinematic signature of a core in solid-body rotation.
The starburst has formed a complex of bright compact \HII~regions, probably
excited by deeply embedded super star clusters, but none of these sources is a
convincing candidate for a galactic nucleus. The nuclei of the merger partners
that created the Medusa have not yet been identified.
