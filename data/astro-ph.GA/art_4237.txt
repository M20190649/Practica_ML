Early Disc Accretion as the Origin of Abundance Anomalies in Globular
  Clusters
Globular clusters (GCs), once thought to be well approximated as simple
stellar populations (i.e. all stars having the same age and chemical
abundance), are now known to host a variety of anomalies, such as multiple
discrete (or spreads in) populations in colour-magnitude diagrams and abundance
variations in light elements (e.g., Na, O, Al). Multiple models have been put
forward to explain the observed anomalies, although all have serious
shortcomings (e.g., requiring a non-standard initial mass function of stars and
GCs to have been initially 10-100 times more massive than observed today).
These models also do not agree with observations of massive stellar clusters
forming today, which do not display significant age spreads nor have gas/dust
within the cluster. Here we present a model for the formation of GCs, where low
mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars accrete enriched material released from
interacting massive binary and rapidly rotating stars onto their circumstellar
discs, and ultimately onto the young stars. As was shown in previous studies,
the accreted material matches the unusual abundances and patterns observed in
GCs. The proposed model does not require multiple generations of
star-formation, conforms to known properties of massive clusters forming today,
and solves the "mass budget problem" without requiring GCs to have been
significantly more massive at birth. Potential caveats to the model as well as
model predictions are discussed.
