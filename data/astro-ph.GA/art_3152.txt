The Formation of Stellar Cusps in Galactic Nuclei
The dynamics of galactic nuclei can be affected by several mechanisms. Among
these are stellar evolution, stellar collisions, mass segregation, and tidal
disruptions of stars due to the central black hole. In this presentation I will
address how each of these affects the stellar cusp and the resulting
observational signatures. Using a set of dynamically evolving Fokker-Planck
simulations I present the dynamical evolution a nuclear stellar cluster and the
growth of the central massive black hole within the Galactic Nucleus. In
addition to the Galactic Center I explore a wide variety of galactic nuclei and
their resulting stellar cusps.
