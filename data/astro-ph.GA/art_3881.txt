Clump mass function at an early stage of molecular cloud evolution: II.
  Galactic cloud complexes
The statistical approach for derivation of the clump mass function (ClMF)
developed by Donkov, Veltchev & Klessen is put to observational test through
comparison with mass distributions of clumps from molecular emission and dust
continuum maps of Galactic cloud complexes, obtained by various authors. The
results indicate gravitational boundedness of the dominant clump population,
with or without taking into account the contribution of their thermal and
magnetic energy. The ClMF can be presented by combination of two power-law
functions separated by a characteristic mass from about ten to hundreds solar
masses. The slope of the intermediate-mass ClMF is shallow and nearly constant
(-0.25 \gtrsim \Gamma_{IM} \gtrsim -0.55) while the high-mass part is fitted by
models that imply gravitationally unstable clumps and exhibit slopes in a
broader range (-0.9 \gtrsim \Gamma_{IM} \gtrsim -1.6), centered at the value of
the stellar initial mass function (\Gamma_{HM} \gtreqless -1.3).
