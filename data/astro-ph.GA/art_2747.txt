Looking for outflow and infall signatures in high mass star forming
  regions
(Context) Many physical parameters change with time in star forming regions.
Here we attempt to correlate changes in infall and outflow motions in high mass
star forming regions with evolutionary stage using JCMT observations. (Aims)
From a sample of 45 high mass star forming regions in three phases of
evolution, we investigate the presence of established infall and outflow
tracers to determine whether there are any trends attributable to the age of
the source. (Methods) We obtained JCMT observations of HCO+/H13CO+ J=4-3 to
trace large scale infall, and SiO J=8-7 to trace recent outflow activity. We
compare the infall and outflow detections to the evolutionary stage of the host
source (high mass protostellar objects, hypercompact HII regions and
ultracompact HII regions). We also note that the integrated intensity of SiO
varies with the full width at half maximum of the H13CO+. (Results) We find a
surprising lack of SiO detections in the middle stage (Hypercompact HII
regions), which may be due to an observational bias. When SiO is detected, we
find that the integrated intensity of the line increases with evolutionary
stage. We also note that all of the sources with infall signatures onto
Ultracompact HII regions have corresponding outflow signatures as well.
