The kinematical behavior of Galactic PNe with [WC] central star
High resolution spectroscopic data of a large sample of galactic planetary
nebulae with [WC] central stars ([WC]PNe) are analyzed to determine their
kinematical behavior. Their heliocentric velocities have been determined with a
precision better than a few km/s. Distances obtained from the literature are
used to derive the peculiar velocities of the objects.
