Barnard 59: No Evidence for Further Fragmentation
The dense molecular clump at the center of the Barnard 59 (B59) complex is
the only region in the Pipe Nebula that has formed a small,stellar cluster. The
previous analysis of a high resolution near-IR dust extinction map revealed
that the nuclear region in B59 is a massive, mostly quiescent clump of 18.9
solar masses. The clump shows a monolithic profile, possibly indicating that
the clump is on the way to collapse, with no evident fragmentation that could
lead to another group of star systems. In this paper we present new analysis
that compares the dust extinction map with a new dust emission radio-continuum
map of higher spatial resolution. We confirm that the clump does not show any
significant evidence for prestellar fragmentation at scales smaller than those
probed previously.
