Orientation of galaxies in structures
The investigation of the orientation of galaxies is a standard test
concerning to scenarios of galaxy formation, because different theories of
galaxy formation make various predictions regarding to the angular momentum of
galaxies. The new method of analysis of the alignment of galaxies in clusters
was proposed in the paper Godlowski (2012) and now is improved. We analyzed the
distribution of the position angles of the galaxy major axes, as well as the
distribution of two angles describing the spatial orientation of galaxy plane,
which gives the information about galaxy angular momenta. We discuss the
orientation of galaxies in groups and clusters of galaxies. The results show
the dependence of the alignment with respect to clusters richness. The
implications of the results for theories of galaxy formation are discussed as
well.
