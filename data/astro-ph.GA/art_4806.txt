Why stellar feedback promotes disc formation in simulated galaxies
We study how feedback influences baryon infall onto galaxies using
cosmological, zoom-in simulations of haloes with present mass
$M_{vir}=6.9\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ to $1.7\times10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Starting
at z=4 from identical initial conditions, implementations of weak and strong
stellar feedback produce bulge- and disc-dominated galaxies, respectively.
Strong feedback favours disc formation: (1) because conversion of gas into
stars is suppressed at early times, as required by abundance matching
arguments, resulting in flat star formation histories and higher gas fractions;
(2) because 50% of the stars form in situ from recycled disc gas with angular
momentum only weakly related to that of the z=0 dark halo; (3) because
late-time gas accretion is typically an order of magnitude stronger and has
higher specific angular momentum, with recycled gas dominating over primordial
infall; (4) because 25-30% of the total accreted gas is ejected entirely before
z~1, removing primarily low angular momentum material which enriches the nearby
inter-galactic medium. Most recycled gas roughly conserves its angular
momentum, but material ejected for long times and to large radii can gain
significant angular momentum before re-accretion. These processes lower galaxy
formation efficiency in addition to promoting disc formation.
