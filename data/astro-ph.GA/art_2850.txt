AGN Winds and the Black-Hole - Galaxy Connection
During the last decade, wide-angle powerful outflows from AGN, both on parsec
and kpc scales, have been detected in many galaxies. These outflows are widely
suspected to be responsible for sweeping galaxies clear of their gas. We
present the analytical model describing the propagation of such outflows and
calculate their observable properties. Large-scale AGN-driven outflows should
have kinetic luminosities \sim {\eta}L_Edd/2 \sim 0.05L_Edd and momentum rates
\sim 20L_Edd/c, where L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity of the central black
hole and {\eta} \sim 0.1 its radiative accretion efficiency. This creates an
expanding two-phase medium in which molecular species coexist with hot gas,
which can persist after the central AGN has switched off. This picture predicts
outflow velocities \sim 1000 - 1500 km/s and mass outflow rates up to 4000
M_\odot/yr on kpc scales, fixed mainly by the host galaxy velocity dispersion
(or equivalently black hole mass). We compare our prediction with recent
observational data, finding excellent agreement, and suggest future
observational tests of this picture.
