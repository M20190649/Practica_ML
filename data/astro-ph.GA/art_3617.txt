A new Extended Main Sequence Turnoff star cluster in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud
We present results on the age and metallicity estimates of the poorly studied
LMC cluster SL 529, from CCD SDSS gr photometry obtained at the Gemini South
telescope with the GMOS attached. The cluster MSTO region possesses an extended
structure, with an age spread (~ 0.5 Gyr) bigger than the mean age width of
known EMSTO LMC clusters. We report for the first time a mean cluster age of
2.25 Gyr and a mean cluster metallicity of Z=0.004, which place it as the most
metal-poor and oldest cluster in the EMSTO LMC cluster group. In addition, the
cluster RC appears to be formed by two concentrations of stars - although it is
not clear whether this feature can be caused, in part, by binary interactions
and mergers -, whereas the cluster core radius of 4.2 pc is in excellent
agreement with those determined for the previously 12 known EMSTO LMC clusters.
