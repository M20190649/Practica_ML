A Schwarzschild model of the Galactic bar with initial density from
  N-body simulations
Using the potential from N-body simulations, we construct the Galactic bar
models with the Schwarzschild method. By varying the pattern speed and the
position angle of the bar, we find that the best-fit bar model has pattern
speed $\Omega_{\rm p}=40\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}\ kpc^{-1}}$, and bar angle
$\theta_{\rm bar}=45^{\circ}$. $N$-body simulations show that the best-fit
model is stable for more than 1.5 Gyrs. Combined with the results in Wang et
al. (2012), we find that the bar angle and/or the pattern speed are not well
constrained by BRAVA data in our Schwarzschild models. The proper motions
predicted from our model are slightly larger than those observed in four
fields. In the future, more kinematic data from the ground and space-based
observations will enable us to refine our model of the Milky Way bar.
