The evolution of late-type galaxies from CASSOWARY lensing systems
We explore the properties of lensing galaxies and lensed faint sources at
redshifts between 1.5 and 3.0. Our sample consists of 9 carefully selected
strongly-lensed galaxies discovered by the CASSOWARY survey in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. We find that, despite some limitations of the
original SDSS data, the homogeneous sample of lensing systems can provide a
useful insight into lens and source properties. We also explore the limitations
of using low-resolution data to model and analyse galaxy-galaxy lensing. We
derive the relative alignment of mass and light in fitted lens profiles. The
range of magnification extends above 5, hence we are able to analyse
potentially small and low-mass galaxies at high redshifts. We confirm the
likely evolution of the size-luminosity relation for blue star-forming galaxies
as a function of redshift
