Trajectory Dynamics of Gas Molecules and Galaxy Formation
The probability distribution of the velocity of gas molecules in a closed
container is described by the kinetic theory of gases. When molecules collide
or impact the walls of a container, they exchange energy and momentum in
accordance with Newton's laws of motion. Between collisions, the trajectory of
individual molecules is a straight line, neglecting gravity. During the
formation of a galaxy, the stars are constrained to a region of space and
exchange energy and momentum in a manner similar to molecules. In this paper,
an exact model of an ideal gas is derived and analyzed to determine the
probability distribution of the molecular velocities, which are then compared
with the probability distribution of velocities associated with stars during
galaxy formation.
