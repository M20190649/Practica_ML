MOCCA code for star cluster simulations - III. Stellar-mass black holes
  in the globular cluster M22
Using a Monte Carlo code, we construct a dynamic evolutionary model of the
Galactic globular cluster M22 (NGC6656). The initial conditions are chosen so
that, after about 12Gyr of stellar and dynamical evolution, the model is an
approximate fit to the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of
the cluster, to its mass function, and to the current binary fraction.
Depending on the distribution of black hole natal kicks, we predict that the
present-day population of stellar-mass black holes ranges from about 40 (no
kicks) down to essentially zero (kicks distributed like those of neutron
stars). Provided that natal kicks do not eject all new black holes, it is
suggested that clusters with a present-day half-mass relaxation time above
about 1Gyr are the ones that may still retain an appreciable population of
black holes.
