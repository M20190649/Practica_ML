Three-dimensional numerical investigations of the morphology of type Ia
  SNRs
We explore the morphology of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs) using
three-dimensional hydrodynamics modeling and an exponential density profile.
Our model distinguishes ejecta from the interstellar medium (ISM), and tracks
the ionization age of shocked ejecta, both of which allow for additional
analysis of the simulated remnants. We also include the adiabatic index as a
free parameter, which affects the compressibility of the fluid and emulates the
efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration by shock fronts. In addition to
generating 3-D images of the simulations, we compute line-of-sight projections
through the remnants for comparison against observations of Tycho's SNR and SN
1006. We find that several features observed in these two remnants, such as the
separation between the fluid discontinuities and the presence of ejecta knots
ahead of the forward shock, can be generated by smooth ejecta without any
initial clumpiness. Our results are consistent with SN 1006 being dynamically
younger than Tycho's SNR, and more efficiently accelerating cosmic rays at its
forward shock. We conclude that clumpiness is not a necessary condition to
reproduce many observed features of Type Ia supernova remnants, particularly
the radial profiles and the fleecy emission from ejecta at the central region
of both remnants.
