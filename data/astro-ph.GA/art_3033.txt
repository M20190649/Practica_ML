Binary Disruption by Massive Black Holes: Hypervelocity Stars, S Stars,
  and Tidal Disruption Events
We examine whether disrupted binary stars can fuel black hole growth. In this
mechanism, tidal disruption produces a single hypervelocity star (HVS) ejected
at high velocity and a former companion star bound to the black hole. After a
cluster of bound stars forms, orbital diffusion allows the black hole to
accrete stars by tidal disruption at a rate comparable to the capture rate. In
the Milky Way, HVSs and the S star cluster imply similar rates of
10^{-5}--10^{-3} yr^{-1} for binary disruption. These rates are consistent with
estimates for the tidal disruption rate in nearby galaxies and imply
significant black hole growth from disrupted binaries on 10 Gyr time scales.
