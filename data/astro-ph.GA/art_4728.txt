The Astrophysical Behavior of Open Clusters along the Milky Way Galaxy
The main aim of this paper is to study the astrophysical behavior of open
clusters' properties along the Milky Way Galaxy. Near-IR JHK (2MASS) photometry
has been used for getting a homogeneous Catalog of 263 open clusters'
parameters, which are studied for the first time by the author through the last
five years. The correlations between the astrophysical parameters of these
clusters have been achieved in morphological way and compared with the most
recent works.
