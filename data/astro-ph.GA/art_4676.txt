The candidate luminous blue variable G79.29+0.46: a comprehensive study
  of its ejecta through a multiwavelength analysis
We present a multiwavelength analysis of the nebula around the candidate
luminous blue variable G79.29+0.46. The study is based on our radio
observations performed at the Expanded Very Large Array and at the Green Bank
Telescope and on archival infrared datasets, including recent images obtained
by the Herschel Space Observatory. We confirm that the radio central object is
characterized by a stellar wind and derive a current mass-loss rate of about
1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1. We find the presence of a dusty compact envelope close to
the star, with a temperature between 40 and 1200 K. We estimate for the outer
ejecta an ionised gas mass of 1.51 Msun and a warm (60--85 K) dust mass of 0.02
Msun. Diagnostics of the far-infrared spectra indicate the presence of a
photo-dissociation region around the ionised gas. Finally, we model the nebula
with the photo-ionization code CLOUDY, using as input parameters those
estimated from our analysis. We find for the central star a luminosity of
10^5.4 Lsun and an effective temperature of 20.4 kK.
