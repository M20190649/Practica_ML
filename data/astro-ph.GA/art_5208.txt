Deep spectroscopic luminosity function of Abell 85: no evidence for a
  steep upturn of the faint-end slope
We present a new deep determination of the spectroscopic LF within the virial
radius of the nearby and massive Abell\,85 (A85) cluster down to the dwarf
regime (M* + 6) using VLT/VIMOS spectra for $\sim 2000$ galaxies with m$_r \leq
21$ mag and $\langle \mu_{e,r} \rangle \leq 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The
resulting LF from 438 cluster members is best modelled by a double Schechter
function due to the presence of a statistically significant upturn at the
faint-end. The amplitude of this upturn ($\alpha_{f} = -1.58^{+0.19}_{-0.15}$),
however, is much smaller than that of the SDSS composite photometric cluster LF
by Popesso et al. 2006, $\alpha_{f} \sim$ -2. The faint-end slope of the LF in
A85 is consistent, within the uncertainties, with that of the field. The red
galaxy population dominates the LF at low luminosities, and is the main
responsible for the upturn. The fact that the slopes of the spectroscopic LFs
in the field and in a cluster as massive as A85 are similar suggests that the
cluster environment does not play a major role in determining the abundance of
low-mass galaxies.
