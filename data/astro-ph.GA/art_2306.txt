The OH Masers Towards IRAS 19092+0841
Context. Maser emission is a strong tool for studying high mass star forming
regions and their evolutionary stages. OH masers in particular can trace the
circumstellar material around protostars and determine their magnetic field
strengths at milliarcsecond resolution.
  Aims. Imaging OH maser mission towards high mass protostellar objects to
determine their evolutionary stages and to locate the detected maser emission
in the process of high mass star formation.
  Methods. In 2007, we surveyed OH maser towards 217 high mass protostellar
objects to study its presence. In this paper, we present a follow up MERLIN
observations of a ground state OH maser emission towards one of these objects,
IRAS 19092+0841.
  Results. Emission from the two OH main spectral lines, 1665 and 1667 MHz,
were detected close to the central object. The positions and velocities of the
OH maser features have been determined. The masers are distributed over a
region of ~ 500 corresponding to 22400 AU (or ~ 0.1 pc) at a distance of 4.48
kpc. The polarization properties of the OH maser features were determined as
well. We identify three Zeeman pairs from which we inferred a magnetic field
strength of ~ 4:4mG pointing towards the observer.
  Conclusions. The relatively small velocity spread and the relatively wide
spacial distribution of the OH maser features support the suggestion that this
object could be in an early evolutionary state before the presence of disk
and/or jet/outfows.
