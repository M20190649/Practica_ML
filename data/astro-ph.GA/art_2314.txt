The Solar neighbourhood in angle coordinates: the Hyades moving group
I investigate the suggestion that the Hyades moving group in the Solar
neighbourhood is the result of a recent inner Lindblad resonance. I use
dynamical "torus" models of the Galaxy to understand the expected distribution
of solar neighbourhood stars in angle coordinates for phase-mixed models and
models which include a resonant component. I show that attempts to find the
signatures of resonances in angle coordinates are strongly influenced by
selection effects, including rather subtle effects associated with the
relationship between action and angle for stars at a given point. These effects
mean that one can not use simple tests to determine whether substructures seen
in the Solar neighbourhood are associated with any given resonance.
