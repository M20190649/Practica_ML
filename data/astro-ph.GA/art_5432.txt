Kompaneets Model Fitting of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble
Winds and supernovae from OB associations create large cavities in the
interstellar medium referred to as superbubbles. The Orion molecular clouds are
the nearest high mass star-forming region and have created a highly elongated,
20 degree x 45 degree, superbubble. We fit Kompaneets models to the
Orion-Eridanus superbubble and find that a model where the Eridanus side of the
superbubble is oriented away from the Sun provides a marginal fit. Because this
model requires an unusually small scaleheight of 40 pc and has the superbubble
inclined 35 degrees from the normal to the Galactic plane, we propose that this
model should be treated as a general framework for modelling the Orion-Eridanus
superbubble, with a secondary physical mechanism not included in the Kompaneets
model required to fully account for the orientation and elongation of the
superbubble.
