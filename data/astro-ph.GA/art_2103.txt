Density PDFs of diffuse gas in the Milky Way
The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the average densities of the
diffuse ionized gas (DIG) and the diffuse atomic gas are close to lognormal,
especially when lines of sight at |b|<5 degree and |b|>5 degree are considered
separately. Our results provide strong support for the existence of a lognormal
density PDF in the diffuse ISM, consistent with a turbulent origin of density
structure in the diffuse gas.
