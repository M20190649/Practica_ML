Evolution of second generation stars in stellar disks of globular and
  nuclear clusters: Omega Centauri as a test case
Globular clusters (GCs) and many nuclear clusters (NCs) show evidence for
hosting multiple generations of stellar populations. Younger stellar
populations in NCs appear to reside in disk like structures, including the
nuclear cluster in our own Galactic center as well as in M31. Kinematic studies
of the anomalous globular cluster Omega Centauri, thought to possibly be a
former dwarf galaxy (or a galactic nucleus), show evidence for its hosting of a
central, kinematically cold disk component. These observations suggest that
formation of second (or multiple) generation stars may occur in flattened disk
like structures. Here we use detailed N-body simulations to explore the
possible evolution of such stellar disks, embedded in globular clusters. We
follow the long term evolution of a disk like structure similar to that
observed in Omega Centauri and study its properties. We find that a
stellar-disk like origin for second generation stellar populations can leave
behind significant kinematic signatures in properties of the clusters,
including an anisotropic distribution, and lower velocity dispersions, which
can be used to constrain the origin of second generations stars and their
dynamical evolution.
