A possible sequential star formation in the giant molecular cloud
  G174+2.5
We investigate the nature of 14 embedded clusters (ECs) related to a group of
four H II regions Sh2-235, Sh2-233, Sh2-232, and Sh2-231 in the giant molecular
cloud G174 + 2.5. Projected towards the Galactic anticentre, these objects are
a possible example of the collect and collapse scenario. We derive
astrophysical parameters (age, reddening, distance, core and cluster radii) for
the ECs and investigate the relationship among their parameters. Parameters are
derived with field decontaminated 2MASS colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and
stellar radial density profiles (RDPs). The CMDs of these young clusters are
characterised by a poorly-populated main sequence and a significant number of
pre-main sequence stars, affected by differential reddening. The ECs are KKC
11, FSR 784, Sh2-235 E2, Sh2-235 Cluster, Sh2-233SE Cluster, BDSB 73, Sh2-235B
Cluster, BDSB 72, BDSB 71, Sh2-232 IR, PCS 2, and the newly found clusters CBB
1 and CBB 2. We were able to derive fundamental parameters for all ECs in the
sample. Structural parameters are derived for FSR 784, Sh2-235 Cluster and
Sh2-235E2.
