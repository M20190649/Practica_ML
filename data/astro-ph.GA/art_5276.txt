Do cloud-cloud collisions trigger high-mass star formation? I. Small
  cloud collisions
We performed sub-parsec (~0.06pc) scale simulations of two idealised
molecular clouds with different masses undergoing a collision. Gas clumps with
density greater than 1e-20 g/cm3 (0.3e4 cm-3) were identified as pre-stellar
cores and tracked through the simulation. The colliding system showed a partial
gas arc morphology with core formation in the oblique shock-front at the
collision interface. These characteristics support NANTEN observations of
objects suspected to be colliding giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We
investigated the effect of turbulence and collision speed on the resulting core
population and compared the cumulative mass distribution to cores in observed
GMCs. Our results suggest that a faster relative velocity increases the number
of cores formed but that cores grow via accretion predominately while in the
shock front, leading to a slower shock being more important for core growth.
The core masses obey a power law relation with index gamma = -1.6, in good
agreement with observations. This suggests that core production through
collisions should follow a similar mass distribution as quiescent formation,
albeit at a higher mass range. If cores can be supported against collapse
during their growth, the estimated ram pressure from gas infall is of the right
order to counter the radiation pressure and form a star of 100Msun.
