The Assembly of the Halo System of the Milky Way as Revealed by
  SDSS/SEGUE -- The CEMP Star Connection
In recent years, massive new spectroscopic data sets, such as the over half
million stellar spectra obtained during the course of SDSS (in particular its
sub-survey SEGUE), have provided the quantitative detail required to formulate
a coherent story of the assembly and evolution of the Milky Way. The disk and
halo systems of our Galaxy have been shown to be both more complex, and more
interesting, than previously thought. Here we concentrate on the halo system of
the Milky Way. New data from SDSS/SEGUE has revealed that the halo system
comprises at least two components, the inner halo and the outer halo, with
demonstrably different characteristics (metallicity distributions, density
distributions, kinematics, etc.). In addition to suggesting new ways to examine
these data, the inner/outer halo dichotomy has enabled an understanding of at
least one long-standing observational result, the increase of the fraction of
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing metallicity.
