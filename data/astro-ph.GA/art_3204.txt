The IRAM-30m line survey of the Horsehead PDR: I. CF+ as a tracer of C+
  and a measure of the Fluorine abundance
C+ is a key species in the interstellar medium but its 158 {\mu}m fine
structure line cannot be observed from ground-based telescopes. Current models
of fluorine chemistry predict that CF+ is the second most important fluorine
reservoir, in regions where C+ is abundant. We detected the J = 1-0 and J = 2-1
rotational lines of CF+ with high signal-to-noise ratio towards the PDR and
dense core positions in the Horsehead. Using a rotational diagram analysis, we
derive a column density of N(CF+) = (1.5 - 2.0) \times 10^12 cm^-2. Because of
the simple fluorine chemistry, the CF+ column density is proportional to the
fluorine abundance. We thus infer the fluorine gas-phase abundance to be F/H =
(0.6 - 1.5) \times 10^-8. Photochemical models indicate that CF+ is found in
the layers where C+ is abundant. The emission arises in the UV illuminated skin
of the nebula, tracing the outermost cloud layers. Indeed, CF+ and C+ are the
only species observed to date in the Horsehead with a double peaked line
profile caused by kinematics. We therefore propose that CF+, which is
detectable from the ground, can be used as a proxy of the C+ layers.
