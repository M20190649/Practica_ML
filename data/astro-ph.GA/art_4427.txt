Young Stellar Objects close to Sgr A*
We aim at modelling small groups of young stars such as IRS 13N, 0.1 pc away
from Sgr A*, which is suggested to contain a few embedded massive young stellar
objects. We perform hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of
molecular clumps orbiting about a $4\times10^6 ~ M_{\odot}$ black hole, to
constrain the formation and the physical conditions of such groups. We find
that, the strong compression due to the black hole along the orbital radius
vector of clumps evolving on highly eccentric orbits causes the clumps
densities to increase to higher than the tidal density of Sgr A*, and required
for star formation. This suggests that the tidal compression from the black
hole could support star formation. Additionally, we speculate that the infrared
excess source G2/DSO approaching Sgr A* on a highly eccentric orbit could be
associated with a dust enshrouded star that may have been formed recently
through the mechanism supported by our models.
