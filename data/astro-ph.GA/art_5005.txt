The H$Î±$ kinematics of interacting galaxies in 12 compact groups
We present new Fabry-Perot observations for a sample of 42 galaxies located
in twelve compact groups of galaxies: HCG 1, HCG 14, HCG 25, HCG 44, HCG 53,
HCG 57, HCG 61, HCG 69, HCG 93, VV 304, LGG 455 and Arp 314. From the 42
observed galaxies, a total of 26 objects are spiral galaxies, which range from
Sa to Im morphological types. The remaining 16 objects are E, S0 and S0a
galaxies. Using these observations, we have derived velocity maps,
monochromatic and velocity dispersion maps for 24 galaxies, where 18 are
spiral, three are S0a, two are S0 and one is an Im galaxy. From the 24 velocity
fields obtained, we could derive rotation curves for 15 galaxies; only two of
them exhibit rotation curves without any clear signature of interactions. Based
on kinematic information, we have evaluated the evolutionary stage of the
different groups of the current sample. We identify groups that range from
having no H$\alpha$ emission to displaying an extremely complex kinematics,
where their members display strongly perturbed velocity fields and rotation
curves. In the case of galaxies with no H$\alpha$ emission, we suggest that
past galaxy interactions removed their gaseous components, thereby quenching
their star formation. However, we can not discard that the lack of H$\alpha$
emission is linked with the detection limit for some of our observations.
