About the nature of Mercer14
We used UKIRT near infrared (NIR) broad band JHK photometry, narrow band
imaging of the 1-0S(1) molecular hydrogen emission line and mid infrared
Spitzer IRAC data to investigate the nature of the young cluster Mercer14.
Foreground star counts in decontaminated NIR photometry and a comparison with
the Besancon Galaxy Model are performed to estimate the cluster distance. This
method yields a distance of 2.5kpc with an uncertainty of about 10% and can be
applied to other young and embedded clusters. Mercer14 shows clear signs of
ongoing star formation with several detected molecular hydrogen outflows, a
high fraction of infrared excess sources and an association to a small gas and
dust cloud. Hence, the cluster is less than 4Myrs old and has a line of sight
extinction of A_K=0.8mag. Based on the most massive cluster members we find
that Mercer14 is an intermediate mass cluster with about 500Mo.
