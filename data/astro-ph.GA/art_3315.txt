The Fornax dwarf galaxy as a remnant of recent dwarf-dwarf merging in
  the Local Group
We present results from the first numerical analysis to support the
hypothesis, first proposed in Coleman et al. (2004), that the Fornax dwarf
galaxy was formed from the minor merging of two dwarfs about 2 Gyr ago. Using
orbits for the Fornax dwarf that are consistent with the latest proper motion
measurements, our dynamical evolution models show that the observed asymmetric
shell-like substructures can be formed from the remnant of a smaller dwarf
during minor merging. These models also predict the formation of diffuse
stellar streams. We discuss how these stellar substructures depend on model
parameters of dwarf-dwarf merging, and how the intermediate-age subpopulations
found in the vicinity of these substructures may be formed from gas accretion
in the past merger events. We also suggest that one of Fornax's GCs originates
from a merged dwarf companion, and demonstrate where as yet undetected tidal
streams or HI gas formed from the dwarf merging may be found in the outer halo
of the Galaxy.
