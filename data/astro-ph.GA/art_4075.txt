The stellar metallicity distribution of the Milky Way from the BATC
  survey
Using the stellar atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature and
metallicity derived from SDSS spectra for 2200 main sequence (MS) stars which
were also observed by Beijing - Arizona - Taiwan - Connecticut (BATC)
photometric system, we develop the polynomial photometric calibration method to
evaluate the stellar effective temperature and metallicity for BATC multi-color
photometric data. This calibration method has been applied to about 160 000 MS
stars from 67 BATC observed fields. Those stars have colors and magnitudes in
the ranges 0.1 < d - h < 1.4 and 14.0 < d < 21.0. We find that there is a peak
of metallicity distribution at [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 in the distance from the Galactic
plane |Z| > 5 kpc which corresponds to the halo component and a peak at [Fe/H]
~ -0.7 in the region 2 < |Z| < 5 kpc where is dominated by the thick disk
stars. The mean stellar metallicity smoothly decreases from -0.65 to -0.78 in
the interval 0.5 < |Z|< 2 kpc. Metallicity distributions in the halo and the
thick disk seem invariant with the distance from the Galactic plane.
