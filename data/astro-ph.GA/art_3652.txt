Dust Properties in the Galactic Bulge
It has been suggested that the ratio of total-to-selective extinction RV in
dust in the interstellar medium differs in the Galactic bulge from its value in
the local neighborhood. We attempt to test this suggestion. The mid-infrared
hydrogen lines in 16 Galactic bulge PNe measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope
are used to determine the extinction corrected H{\beta} flux. This is compared
to the observed H{\beta} flux to obtain the total extinction at H{\beta}. The
selective extinction is obtained from the observed Balmer decrement in these
nebulae. The value of RV can then be found. The ratio of total-to-selective
extinction in the Galactic bulge is consistent with the value RV =3.1, which is
the same as has been found in the local neighborhood. We conclude that the
suggestion that RV is different in the Galactic bulge is incorrect. The reasons
for this are discussed.
