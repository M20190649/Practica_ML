Improved determination of the 1(0)-0(0) rotational frequency of NH3D+
  from the high resolution spectrum of the v4 infrared band
The high resolution spectrum of the v4 band of NH3D+ has been measured by
difference frequency IR laser spectroscopy in a multipass hollow cathode
discharge cell. From the set of molecular constants obtained from the analysis
of the spectrum, a value of 262817(6) MHz (3sigma) has been derived for the
frequency of the 1(0)-0(0) rotational transition. This value supports the
assignment to NH3D+ of lines at 262816.7 MHz recorded in radio astronomy
observations in Orion-IRc2 and the cold prestellar core B1-bS.
