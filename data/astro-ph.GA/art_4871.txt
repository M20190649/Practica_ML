Vibrationally Excited Molecular Hydrogen Near Herschel 36
We present the first high resolution UV spectra toward Herschel 36, a
Trapezium-like system of high-mass stars contained within the Lagoon Nebula
(M8, NGC 6523). The spectra reveal extreme ro-vibrational excitation of
molecular hydrogen in material at a single velocity or very small range of
velocities, with this component presumably lying near the star system and
undergoing fluorescent excitation. The overall H$_2$ excitation is similar to,
but apparently larger than, that seen towards HD 37903 which previously showed
the largest vibrationally excited H$_2$ column densities seen in UV absorption
spectra. While the velocities of the highly excited H$_2$ lines are consistent
within each observation, it appears that they underwent a $\sim$60 km s$^{-1}$
redshift during the 3.6 years between observations. In neither case does the
velocity of the highly excited material match the velocity of the bulk of the
line-of-sight material which appears to mostly be in the foreground of M8.
Recent work shows unusually excited CH and CH$^{+}$ lines and several unusually
broad Diffuse Interstellar Bands towards Herschel 36. Along with the H$_2$
excitation, all of these findings appear to be related to the extreme
environment within $\sim$0.1 pc of the massive young stellar system.
