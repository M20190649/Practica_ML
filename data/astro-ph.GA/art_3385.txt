Halo millisecond pulsars ejected by intermediate mass black holes in
  globular clusters
Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) are among the most elusive objects in
contemporary astrophysics. Both theoretical and observational evidence of their
existence is subject of debate. Conversely, both theory and observations
confirm the presence of a large population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with
low mass companions residing in globular cluster (GC) centers. If IMBHs are
common in GC centers as well, then dynamical interactions will inevitably break
up many of these binaries, causing the ejection of several fast MSPs in the
Galactic halo. Such population of fast halo MSPs, hard to produce with
'standard' MSP generation mechanisms, would provide a strong, albeit indirect,
evidence of the presence of a substantial population of IMBHs in GCs. In this
paper we study in detail the dynamical formation and evolution of such fast
MSPs population, highlighting the relevant observational properties and
assessing detection prospects with forthcoming radio surveys.
