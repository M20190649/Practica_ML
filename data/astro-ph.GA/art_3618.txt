Resolved Depletion Zones and Spatial Differentiation of N2H+ and N2D+
We present a study on the spatial distribution of N2D+ and N2H+ in thirteen
protostellar systems. Eight of thirteen objects observed with the IRAM 30m
telescope show relative offsets between the peak N2D+ (J=2-1) and N2H+ (J=1-0)
emission. We highlight the case of L1157 using interferometric observations
from the Submillimeter Array and Plateau de Bure Interferometer of the N2D+
(J=3-2) and N2H+ (J=1-0) transitions respectively. Depletion of N2D+ in L1157
is clearly observed inside a radius of ~2000 AU (7") and the N2H+ emission is
resolved into two peaks at radii of ~1000 AU (3.5"), inside the depletion
region of N2D+. Chemical models predict a depletion zone in N2H+ and N2D+ due
to destruction of H2D+ at T ~ 20 K and the evaporation of CO off dust grains at
the same temperature. However, the abundance offsets of 1000 AU between the two
species are not reproduced by chemical models, including a model that follows
the infall of the protostellar envelope. The average abundance ratios of N2D+
to N2H+ have been shown to decrease as protostars evolve by Emprechtinger et
al., but this is the first time depletion zones of N2D+ have been spatially
resolved. We suggest that the difference in depletion zone radii for N2H+ and
N2D+ is caused by either the CO evaporation temperature being above 20 K or an
H2 ortho-to-para ratio gradient in the inner envelope.
