Binary systems: implications for outflows & periodicities relevant to
  masers
Bipolar molecular outflows have been observed and studied extensively in the
past, but some recent observations of periodic variations in maser intensity
pose new challenges. Even quasi-periodic maser flares have been observed and
reported in the literature. Motivated by these data, we have tried to study
situations in binary systems with specific attention to the two observed
features, i.e., the bipolar flows and the variabilities in the maser intensity.
We have studied the evolution of spherically symmetric wind from one of the
bodies in the binary system, in the plane of the binary. Our approach includes
the analytical study of rotating flows with numerical computation of
streamlines of fluid particles using PLUTO code. We present the results of our
findings assuming simple configurations, and discuss the implications.
