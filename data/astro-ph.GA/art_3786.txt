CN Anomalies in the Halo System and the Origin of Globular Clusters in
  the Milky Way
We explore the kinematics and orbital properties of a sample of red giants in
the halo system of the Milky Way that are thought to have formed in globular
clusters, based on their anomalously strong UV/blue CN bands. The orbital
parameters of the CN-strong halo stars are compared to those of the inner- and
outer-halo populations as described by Carollo et al., and to the orbital
parameters of globular clusters with well-studied Galactic orbits. The
CN-strong field stars and the globular clusters both exhibit kinematics and
orbital properties similar to the inner-halo population, indicating that
stripped or destroyed globular clusters could be a significant source of
inner-halo field stars, and suggesting that both the CN-strong stars and the
majority of globular clusters are primarily associated with this population.
