Abundances and ADFs in PNe with WC central stars
We present preliminary results obtained from the analysis of very deep
echelle spectra of a dozen planetary nebulae with [WC] or weak emission lines
(wels) central stars. The computed abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) are
moderate, with values lower than 4. In principle, no evidence of the H-poor
metal enriched inclusions proposed by Liu et al. (2000) have been found.
However, a detailed analysis of the data is in progress.
