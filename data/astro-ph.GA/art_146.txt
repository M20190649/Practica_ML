A High-Resolution Study of Two Galactic HI Halo Clouds in the Ophiuchus
  Superbubble
Two compact HI clouds which seem to belong to the Ophiuchus superbubble were
studied at ~30" resolution using the Very Large Array (VLA) in C and D
configurations together with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) providing the
short-spacing flux. Here we present preliminary results of the data analysis.
