CARMA Survey Toward Infrared-bright Nearby Galaxies (STING). III. The
  Dependence of Atomic and Molecular Gas Surface Densities on Galaxy Properties
We investigate the correlation between CO and HI emission in 18 nearby
galaxies from the CARMA Survey Toward IR-Bright Nearby Galaxies (STING) at
sub-kpc and kpc scales. Our sample, spanning a wide range in stellar mass and
metallicity, reveals evidence for a metallicity dependence of the HI column
density measured in regions exhibiting CO emission. Such a dependence is
predicted by the equilibrium model of McKee & Krumholz, which balances H_2
formation and dissociation. The observed HI column density is often smaller
than predicted by the model, an effect we attribute to unresolved clumping,
although values close to the model prediction are also seen. We do not observe
HI column densities much larger than predicted, as might be expected were there
a diffuse HI component that did not contribute to H_2 shielding. We also find
that the H_2 column density inferred from CO correlates strongly with the
stellar surface density, suggesting that the local supply of molecular gas is
tightly regulated by the stellar disk.
