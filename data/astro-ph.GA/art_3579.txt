Eta Carinae -- Physics of the Inner Ejecta
Eta Carinae's inner ejecta are dominated observationally by the bright
Weigelt blobs and their famously rich spectra of nebular emission and
absorption lines. They are dense (n_e ~ 10^7 to 10^8 cm^-3), warm (T_e ~ 6000
to 7000 K) and slow moving (~40 km/s) condensations of mostly neutral (H^0)
gas. Located within 1000 AU of the central star, they contain heavily
CNO-processed material that was ejected from the star about a century ago.
Outside the blobs, the inner ejecta include absorption-line clouds with similar
conditions, plus emission-line gas that has generally lower densities and a
wider range of speeds (reaching a few hundred km/s) compared to the blobs. The
blobs appear to contain a negligible amount of dust and have a nearly dust-free
view of the central source, but our view across the inner ejecta is severely
affected by uncertain amounts of dust having a patchy distribution in the
foreground. Emission lines from the inner ejecta are powered by photoionization
and fluorescent processes. The variable nature of this emission, occurring in a
5.54 yr event cycle, requires specific changes to the incident flux that hold
important clues to the nature of the central object.
