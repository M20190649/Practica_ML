Astrophysical parameters of ten poorly studied open star clusters
We present here the fundamental parameters of ten open star clusters,
nominated from Kronberger et al. (2006) who presented some new discovered
stellar groups on the basis of 2MASS photometry and DSS visual images. Star
counts and photometric parameters (radius, membership, distances, color excess,
age, luminosity function, mass function, total mass, and the dynamical
relaxation time) have been determined for these ten clusters for the first
time. In order to calibrate our procedures, the main parameters (distance, age,
and color excesses) have been re-estimated for another five clusters, which are
studied by Kronberger et al. (2006) as well.
