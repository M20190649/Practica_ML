Accuracy Diagrams for the Galactic Rotation Curve and Kinematical
  Distances
We revisit the methods to determine the Galactic rotation curve and
kinematical distances from radial velocities and proper motions. We construct
"accuracy diagrams" to show the distributions in the galactic plane of expected
uncertainties in the derived quantities such as rotation velocities and
kinematical distances. We discuss how to optimize the source selection for
measurements of kinematical quantities based on the accuracy diagrams.
