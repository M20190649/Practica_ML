The Spitzer Survey of Interstellar Clouds in the Gould Belt. VI. The
  Auriga-California Molecular Cloud observed with IRAC and MIPS
We present observations of the Auriga-California Molecular Cloud (AMC) at
3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, 70 and 160 micron observed with the IRAC and MIPS
detectors as part of the Spitzer Gould Belt Legacy Survey. The total mapped
areas are 2.5 sq-deg with IRAC and 10.47 sq-deg with MIPS. This giant molecular
cloud is one of two in the nearby Gould Belt of star-forming regions, the other
being the Orion A Molecular Cloud (OMC). We compare source counts, colors and
magnitudes in our observed region to a subset of the SWIRE data that was
processed through our pipeline. Using color-magnitude and color-color diagrams,
we find evidence for a substantial population of 166 young stellar objects
(YSOs) in the cloud, many of which were previously unknown. Most of this
population is concentrated around the LkHalpha 101 cluster and the filament
extending from it. We present a quantitative description of the degree of
clustering and discuss the fraction of YSOs in the region with disks relative
to an estimate of the diskless YSO population. Although the AMC is similar in
mass, size and distance to the OMC, it is forming about 15 - 20 times fewer
stars.
