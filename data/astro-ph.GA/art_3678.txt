Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission-Line Filter
  Images--I: Structure and Evolution
We have performed a detailed analysis of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720) using HST
WFC3 images and derived a new 3-D model. Existing high spectral resolution
spectra played an important supplementary role in our modeling. It is shown
that the Main Ring of the nebula is an ionization-bounded irregular
non-symmetric disk with a central cavity and perpendicular extended lobes
pointed almost towards the observer. The faint outer halos are determined to be
fossil radiation, i.e. radiation from gas ionized in an earlier stage of the
nebula when it was not ionization bounded.
  The narrow-band WFC3 filters that isolate some of the emission-lines are
affected by broadening on their short wavelength side and all the filters were
calibrated using ground-based spectra. The filter calibration results are
presented in an appendix.
