Stochastic stellar cluster IMFs: Models and impact on integrated cluster
  parameter determination
Stellar clusters are regularly used to study the evolution of their host
galaxy. Except for a few nearby galaxies, these studies rely on the
interpretation of integrated cluster properties, especially integrated
photometry observed using multiple filters (i.e. the Spectral Energy
Distribution SED). To allow interpretation of such observations, we present a
large set of GALEV cluster models using the realistic approach of adopting
stochastically-sampled stellar IMFs. We provide models for a wide range of
cluster masses (10^3 - 2 * 10^5$ Msun), metallicities (-2.3 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.18
dex), foreground extinction, and 184 regularly used filters. We analyze various
sets of stochastic cluster SEDs by fitting them with non-stochastic models,
which is the procedure commonly used in this field. We identify caveats and
quantify the fitting uncertainties associated with this standard procedure. We
show that this can yield highly unreliable fitting results, especially for
low-mass clusters.
