A catalog of 120 NGC open star clusters
A sample of 145 JHK--2MASS observations of NGC open star clusters is studied,
of which 132 have never been studied before. Twelve are classified as non-open
clusters and 13 are re-estimated self-consistently, after applying the same
methods in order to compare and calibrate our reduction procedures. The
fundamental and structural parameters of the 120 new open clusters studied here
are derived using color-magnitude diagrams of JHK Near-IR photometry with the
fitting of solar metallicity isochrones. We provide here, for the first time, a
catalog of the main parameters for these 120 open clusters, namely, diameter,
distance, reddening and age.
