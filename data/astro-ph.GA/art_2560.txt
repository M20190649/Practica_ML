First Results from Pan-STARRS1: Faint, High Proper Motion White Dwarfs
  in the Medium-Deep Fields
The Pan-STARRS1 survey has obtained multi-epoch imaging in five bands
(Pan-STARRS1 gps, rps, ips, zps, and yps) on twelve "Medium Deep Fields", each
of which spans a 3.3 degree circle. For the period between Apr 2009 and Apr
2011 these fields were observed 50-200 times. Using a reduced proper motion
diagram, we have extracted a list of 47 white dwarf (WD) candidates whose
Pan-STARRS1 astrometry indicates a non-zero proper motion at the 6-sigma level,
with a typical 1-sigma proper motion uncertainty of 10 mas/yr. We also used
astrometry from SDSS (when available) and USNO-B to assess our proper motion
fits. None of the WD candidates exhibits evidence of statistically significant
parallaxes, with a typical 1-sigma uncertainty of 8 mas. Twelve of these
candidates are known WDs, including the high proper motion (1.7"/yr) WD LHS
291. We confirm three more objects as WDs through optical spectroscopy. Based
on the Pan-STARRS1 colors, ten of the stars are likely to be cool WDs with 4170
K Teff 5000 K and cooling ages <9 Gyr. We classify these objects as likely
thick disk WDs based on their kinematics. Our current sample represents only a
small fraction of the Pan-STARRS1 data. With continued coverage from the Medium
Deep Field Survey and the 3pi survey, Pan-STARRS1 should find many more high
proper motion WDs that are part of the old thick disk and halo.
