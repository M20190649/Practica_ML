A study of the metal-rich, thick disk globular cluster NGC5927
We present a list of 72 radial velocity member stars in the metal-rich
globular cluster NGC5927. The radial velocities are based on multi-epoch,
multi-fibre spectra. We identify 46 RGB/HB stars and 26 turn-off stars that are
radial velocity members in the cluster. This cluster is situated quite close to
the disk and hence fore- and/or background contamination, especially in the
outskirts of the cluster, can be quite severe. Fortunately, the cluster has a
radial velocity (we determine it to v_rad=--104.03 +/- 5.03 km/s) that sets it
clearly apart from the bulk velocities of the surrounding, background, and
foreground stellar populations. Hence, our identification of members is clean
and we can quantify a 50% contamination when stars in the outer part of the
cluster are selected solely based on position in the colour-magnitude diagram
as opposed to selections based on radial velocities.
