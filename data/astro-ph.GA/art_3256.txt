Driven Multifluid MHD Molecular Cloud Turbulence
It is believed that turbulence may have a significant impact on star
formation and the dynamics and evolution of the molecular clouds in which this
occurs. It is also known that non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects influence
the nature of this turbulence. We present the results of a numerical study of
4-fluid MHD turbulence in which the dynamics of electrons, ions, charged dust
grains and neutrals and their interactions are followed. The parameters
describing the fluid being simulated are based directly on observations of
molecular clouds. We find that the velocity and magnetic field power spectra
are strongly influenced by multifluid effects on length-scales at least as
large as 0.05 pc. The PDFs of the various species in the system are all found
to be close to log-normal, with charged species having a slightly less
platykurtic (flattened) distribution than the neutrals. We find that the
introduction of multifluid effects does not significantly alter the structure
functions of the centroid velocity increment.
