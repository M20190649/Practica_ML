Finding halo streams with a pencil-beam survey: new wraps in the
  Sagittarius stream
We use data from two CFHT-MegaCam photometric pencil-beam surveys in the g'
and the r' bands to measure distances to the Sagittarius, the Palomar 5 and the
Orphan stream. We show that, using a cross-correlation algorithm to detect the
turnoff point of the main sequence, it is possible to overcome the main
limitation of a two-bands pencil-beam survey, namely the lack of adjacent
control-fields that can be used to subtract the foreground and background stars
to enhance the signal on the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We describe the
cross-correlation algorithm and its implementation. We combine the resulting
main sequence turnoff points with theoretical isochrones to derive photometric
distances to the streams. Our results (31 detections on the Sagittarius stream
and one each for the Palomar 5 and the Orphan streams) confirm the findings by
previous studies, expand the distance trend for the Sagittarius faint southern
branch and, for the first time, trace the Sagittarius faint branch of the
northern-leading arm out to 56 kpc. In addition, they show evidence for new
substructure: we argue that these detections trace the continuation of the
Sagittarius northern-leading arm into the southern hemisphere, and find a
nearby branch of the Sagittarius trailing wrap in the northern hemisphere.
