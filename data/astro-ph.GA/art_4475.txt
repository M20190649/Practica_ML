Hot Core, Outflows and Magnetic Fields in W43-MM1 (G30.79 FIR 10)
We present submillimeter spectral line and dust continuum polarization
observations of a remarkable hot core and multiple outflows in the high-mass
star-forming region W43-MM1 (G30.79 FIR 10), obtained using the Submillimeter
Array (SMA). A temperature of $\sim$ 400 K is estimated for the hot-core using
CH$_3$CN (J=19-18) lines, with detections of 11 K-ladder components. The high
temperature and the mass estimates for the outflows indicate high-mass
star-formation. The continuum polarization pattern shows an ordered
distribution, and its orientation over the main outflow appears aligned to the
outflow. The derived magnetic field indicates slightly super-critical
conditions. While the magnetic and outflow energies are comparable, the B-field
orientation appears to have changed from parsec scales to $\sim$ 0.1 pc scales
during the core/star-formation process.
