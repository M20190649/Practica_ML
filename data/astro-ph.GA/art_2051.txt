Methanol Maser Emission from Galactic Center Sources with Excess 4.5
  Î¼m Emission
We present a study of signatures of on-going star formation in a sample of
protostellar objects with enhanced 4.5 {\mu}m emission ('green' sources) near
the Galactic center. To understand how star formation in the Galactic center
region compares to that of the Galactic disk, we used the Expanded Very Large
Array to observe radiatively excited Class II 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers and
collisionally excited Class I 44 GHz CH3OH masers, both tracers of high-mass
star formation, toward a sample of 34 Galactic center and foreground 'green'
sources. We find that 33\pm15% of Galactic center sources are coincident with
6.7 GHz masers, and that 44\pm17% of foreground sources are coincident with 6.7
GHz masers. For 44 GHz masers, we find correlation rates of 27\pm13% and
25\pm13% for Galactic center green sources and foreground green sources,
espectively. Based on these CH3OH maser detection rates, as well as
correlations of green sources with other tracers of star formation, such as 24
{\mu}m emission and infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), we find no significant
difference between the green sources in the Galactic center and those
foreground to it. This suggests that once the star formation process has begun,
the environmental differences between the Galactic center region and the
Galactic disk have little effect on its observational signatures. We do find,
however, some evidence that may support a recent episode of star formation in
the Galactic center region.
