A Survey of Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer Observations of
  Cataclysmic Variables
During its lifetime, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) was
used to observe 99 cataclysmic variables in 211 separate observations. Here, we
present a survey of the moderate resolution (R\simeq10,000), far-ultraviolet
(905 - 1188 {\deg}A), time-averaged FUSE spectra of cataclysmic variables
(CVs). The FUSE spectra are morphologically diverse. They show contributions
from the accretion disk, the disk chromosphere, disk outflows, and the white
dwarf, but the relative contribution of each component varies widely as a
function of CV subtype, orbital period and evolutionary state, inclination,
mass accretion rate, and magnetic field strength of the white dwarf. The data
reveal information about the structure, temperature, density and mass flow
rates of the disk and disk winds, the temperature of the white dwarf and the
effects of ongoing accretion on its structure, and the long-term response of
the systems to disk outbursts. The complete atlas of time-averaged FUSE spectra
of CVs are available at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope Science
Institute as a High Level Science Product.
