Chemical Differentiation toward the Pipe Nebula Starless Cores
We used the new IRAM 30-m FTS backend to perform an unbiased ~15 GHz wide
survey at 3 mm toward the Pipe Nebula young diffuse starless cores. We found an
unexpectedly rich chemistry. We propose a new observational classification
based on the 3 mm molecular line emission normalized by the core visual
extinction (Av). Based on this classification, we report a clear
differentiation in terms of chemical composition and of line emission
properties, which served to define three molecular core groups. The "diffuse"
cores, Av<~15, show poor chemistry with mainly simple species (e.g. CS and
CCH). The "oxo-sulfurated" cores, Av~15--22, appear to be abundant in species
like SO and SO2, but also in HCO, which seem to disappear at higher densities.
Finally, the "deuterated" cores, Av>~22, show typical evolved chemistry prior
to the onset of the star formation process, with nitrogenated and deuterated
species, as well as carbon chain molecules. Based on these categories, one of
the "diffuse" cores (Core 47) has the spectral line properties of the
"oxo-sulfurated" ones, which suggests that it is a possible failed core.
