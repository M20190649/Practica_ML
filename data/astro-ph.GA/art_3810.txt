First identification and absolute magnitudes of the red clump stars in
  the Solar neighbourhood for WISE
We present the first determination of absolute magnitudes for the red clump
(RC) stars with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We used
recently reduced parallaxes taken from the Hipparcos catalogue and identified
3889 RC stars with the WISE photometry in the Solar neighbourhood. Mode values
estimated from the distributions of absolute magnitudes and a colour of the RC
stars in WISE photometry are M_{W1}=-1.635(0.026), M_{W3}=-1.606(0.024) and
(W1-W3)_0=-0.028(0.001) mag. These values are consistent with those obtained
from the transformation formulae using 2MASS data. Distances of the RC stars
estimated by using their M_{W1} and M_{W3} absolute magnitudes are in agreement
with the ones calculated by the spectrophotometric method, as well. These WISE
absolute magnitudes can be used in astrophysical researches where distance
plays an important role.
