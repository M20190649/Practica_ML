Local stellar kinematics from RAVE data: IV. Solar neighbourhood
  age-metallicity relation
We investigated the age-metallicity relation using a sample of 5691 F and G
type dwarfs from RAVE DR3 by applying several constraints: i) We selected stars
with surface gravities log g < 3.8 and effective temperatures in the
5310<T_{eff}(K)<7300 range and obtained a dwarf sample. ii) We plotted the
dwarfs in metallicity sub-samples in the T_{eff}-(J-K_s)_0 plane to compare
with the corresponding data of Gonzalez Hernandez & Bonifacio (2009) and
identified the ones in agreement. iii) We fitted the reduced dwarf sample
obtained from constraints (i) and (ii) to the Padova isochrones and
re-identified those which occupy the plane defined by isochrones with ages t <
13 Gyr. iv) Finally, we omitted dwarfs with total velocity errors larger than
10.63 km/s. We estimated the ages using the Bayesian procedure of Jorgensen &
Lindegren (2005). The largest age-metallicity slope was found for early F-type
dwarfs. We found steeper slopes when we plotted the data as a function of
spectral type rather than Galactic population. We noticed a substantial scatter
in metallicity distribution at all ages. The metal-rich old dwarfs turned out
to be G-type stars which can be interpreted as they migrated from the inner
disc or bulge.
