Star cluster evolution in barred disc galaxies. I. Planar periodic
  orbits
The dynamical evolution of stellar clusters is driven to a large extent by
their environment. Several studies so far have considered the effect of tidal
fields and their variations, such as, e.g., from giant molecular clouds,
galactic discs, or spiral arms. In this paper we will concentrate on a tidal
field whose effects on star clusters have not yet been studied, namely that of
bars. We present a set of direct N-body simulations of star clusters moving in
an analytic potential representing a barred galaxy. We compare the evolution of
the clusters moving both on different planar periodic orbits in the barred
potential and on circular orbits in a potential obtained by axisymmetrising its
mass distribution. We show that both the shape of the underlying orbit and its
stability have strong impact on the cluster evolution as well as the morphology
and orientation of the tidal tails and the sub-structures therein. We find that
the dissolution time-scale of the cluster in our simulations is mainly
determined by the tidal forcing along the orbit and, for a given tidal forcing,
only very little by the exact shape of the gravitational potential in which the
cluster is moving.
