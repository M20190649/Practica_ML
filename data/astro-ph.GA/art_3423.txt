Clumpy streams in a smooth dark halo: the case of Palomar 5
By means of direct N-body simulations and simplified numerical models, we
study the formation and characteristics of the tidal tails around Palomar 5,
along its orbit in the Milky Way potential. Unlike previous findings, we are
able to reproduce the substructures observed in the stellar streams of this
cluster, without including any lumpiness in the dark matter halo. We show that
overdensities similar to those observed in Palomar 5 can be reproduced by the
epicyclic motion of stars along its tails, i.e. a simple local accumulation of
orbits of stars that escaped from the cluster with very similar positions and
velocities. This process is able to form stellar clumps at distances of several
kiloparsecs from the cluster, so it is not a phenomenon confined to the inner
part of Palomar 5's tails, as previously suggested. Our models can reproduce
the density contrast between the clumps and the surrounding tails found in the
observed streams, without including any lumpiness in the dark halo, suggesting
new upper limits on its granularity.
