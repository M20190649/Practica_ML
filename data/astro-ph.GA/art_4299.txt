A photometric study of the Open Cluster II: Stellar population and
  dynamical evolution in NGC 559
We present UBVRI photometry of stars in the field of the intermediate-age
open cluster NGC 559. By determining the stellar membership probabilities
derived through a photometric and kinematic study of the cluster, we identify
the 22 most probable cluster members. These are used to obtain robust cluster
parameters. The mean proper motion of the cluster is \mu_x = -3.29+/-0.35,
\mu_y = -1.24+/-0.28 mas/yr. The radial distribution of the stellar surface
density gives a cluster radius of 4'.5+/-0'.2 (3.2+/-0.2 pc). By fitting solar
metallicity stellar isochrones to the colour-colour and colour-magnitude
diagrams, we find a uniform cluster reddening of E(B-V) = 0.82+/-0.02. The
cluster has an age of 224+/-25 Myr and is at a distance of 2.43+/-0.23 kpc.
From the optical and near-infrared two-colour diagrams, we obtain colour
excesses in the direction of the cluster E(V-K) = 2.14+/-0.02, E(J-K) =
0.37+/-0.01, and E(B-V)= 0.76+/-0.04. A total-to-selective extinction of
Rv=3.5+/-0.1 is found in the direction of the cluster which is marginally
higher than the normal value. We derive the luminosity function and the mass
function for the cluster main sequence. The mass function slope is found to be
-2.1+/-0.3. We find evidence of mass segregation in this dynamically relaxed
cluster.
