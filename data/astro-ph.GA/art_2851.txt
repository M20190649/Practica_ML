Detection of C60 in embedded young stellar objects, a Herbig Ae/Be star
  and an unusual post-AGB star
The first detection of the C60 (Buckminsterfullerene) molecule in massive
embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) is reported. Observations with Spitzer
IRS reveal the presence of C60 in YSOs ISOGAL-P J174639.6-284126 and SSTGC
372630 in the Central Molecular Zone in the Galactic centre, and in a YSO
candidate, 2MASS J06314796+0419381, in the Rosette nebula. The first detection
of C60 in a Herbig Ae/Be star, HD 97300, is also reported. These observations
extend the range of astrophysical environments in which C60 is found to YSOs
and a pre-main sequence star. C60 excitation and formation mechanisms are
discussed in the context of these results, together with its presence and
processes in post-AGB objects such as HR 4049.
