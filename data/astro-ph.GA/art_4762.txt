Photoionisation and Heating of a Supernova Driven, Turbulent,
  Interstellar Medium
The Diffuse Ionised Gas (DIG) in galaxies traces photoionisation feedback
from massive stars. Through three dimensional photoionisation simulations, we
study the propagation of ionising photons, photoionisation heating and the
resulting distribution of ionised and neutral gas within snapshots of
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova driven turbulent interstellar
medium. We also investigate the impact of non-photoionisation heating on
observed optical emission line ratios. Inclusion of a heating term which scales
less steeply with electron density than photoionisation is required to produce
diagnostic emission line ratios similar to those observed with the Wisconsin
H{\alpha} Mapper. Once such heating terms have been included, we are also able
to produce temperatures similar to those inferred from observations of the DIG,
with temperatures increasing to above 15000 K at heights |z| > 1 kpc. We find
that ionising photons travel through low density regions close to the midplane
of the simulations, while travelling through diffuse low density regions at
large heights. The majority of photons travel small distances (< 100pc);
however some travel kiloparsecs and ionise the DIG.
