Extending the Hyades
We explore the implications of models of the Hyades moving group in which it
has a resonant origin, for regions of the Galaxy beyond the Solar
neighbourhood. We show that while models associated with different resonances
can produce nearly identical substructure in the local velocity distribution,
the velocity distribution away from the Solar neighbourhood has different
properties for different models. In particular there is a variation between
different models of where in Galactocentric radius the observed Hyades signal
in velocity space is strongest, at a given Galactic azimuth. We note, however,
that the uncertainties in currently available data, primarily due to uncertain
distances to stars, hide these signatures rather effectively, meaning we are
not yet able to determine which resonance is the cause of the Hyades.
