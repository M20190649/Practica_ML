Morphological transformations of Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Group
In the Local Group there are three main types of dwarf galaxies: Dwarf
Irregulars, Dwarf Spheroidals, and Dwarf Ellipticals. Intermediate/transitional
types are present as well. This contribution reviews the idea that the present
day variety of dwarf galaxy morphologies in the Local Group might reveal the
existence of a transformation chain of events, of which any particular dwarf
galaxy represents a manifestation of a particular stage. In other words, all
dwarf galaxies that now are part of the Local Group would have formed
identically in the early universe, but then evolved differently because of
morphological transformations induced by dynamical processes like galaxy
harassment, ram pressure stripping, photo-evaporation, and so forth. We start
describing the population of dwarf galaxies and their spatial distribution in
the LG. Then, we describe those phenomena that can alter the morphology of a
dwarf galaxies, essentially by removing, partially or completely, their gas
content. Lastly, we discuss morphological signatures in the Local Group Dwarf
Galaxies that can be attributed to different dynamical phenomena. While it is
difficult to identify a unique and continuous transformation sequence, we have
now a reasonable understanding of the basic evolutionary paths that lead to the
various dwarf galaxy types.
