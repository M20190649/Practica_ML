Hydrodynamical simulations of a compact source scenario for G2
The origin of the dense gas cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic Center
(Gillessen et al. 2012) is still a debated puzzle. G2 might be a diffuse cloud
or the result of an outflow from an invisible star embedded in it. We present
here detailed simulations of the evolution of winds on G2's orbit. We find that
the hydrodynamic interaction with the hot atmosphere present in the Galactic
Center and the extreme gravitational field of the supermassive black hole must
be taken in account when modeling such a source scenario. We find that the

this scenario most of the Br\gamma\ luminosity is expected to come from the
highly filamentary densest shocked wind material. G2's observational properties
can be used to constrain the properties of the outflow and our best model has a
mass outflow rate of Mdot,w=8.8 x 10^{-8} Msun/yr and a wind velocity of vw =
50 km/s. These values are compatible with those of a young TTauri star wind, as
already suggested by Scoville & Burkert (2013).
