Characterization of Turbulence from Submillimeter Dust Emission
In this paper we use our recent technique for estimating the turbulent
component of the magnetic field to derive the structure functions of the
unpolarized emission as well as that of the Stokes Q and U parameters of the
polarized emission. The solutions for the structure functions to 350-um SHARP
polarization data of OMC-1 allow the determination of the corresponding
turbulent correlation length scales. The estimated values for these length
scales are 9.4" +/- 0.1", 7.3" +/- 0.1", 12.6" +/- 0.2" (or 20.5 +/- 0.2, 16.0
+/- 0.2, and 27.5 +/- 0.4 mpc at 450 pc, the adopted distance for OMC-1) for
the Stokes Q and U parameters, and for the unpolarized emission N,
respectively. Our current results for Q and U are consistent with previous
results obtained through other methods, and may indicate presence of anisotropy
in magnetized turbulence. We infer a weak coupling between the dust component
responsible for the unpolarized emission N and the magnetic field B from the
significant difference between their turbulent correlation length scales.
