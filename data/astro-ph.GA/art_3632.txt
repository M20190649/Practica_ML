Galactic Nuclear Cluster Formation Via Globular Cluster Mergers
We apply the idea that dense stellar systems in the central region of
galaxies are formed via globular cluster mergers to the formation of the
nuclear star cluster of the Milky Way, where a massive black hole is present.
Our high precision N-body simulations show a good fit to the observational
characteristics of the Milky Way nuclear cluster, giving further reliability to
the so called migratory model for the formation of compact systems in the inner
galaxy regions keywords galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: black holes - galaxies:
