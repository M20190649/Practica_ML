The Herschel and JCMT Gould Belt Surveys: Constraining Dust Properties
  in the Perseus B1 Clump with PACS, SPIRE, and SCUBA-2
We present Herschel observations from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey and
SCUBA-2 science verification observations from the JCMT Gould Belt Survey of
the B1 clump in the Perseus molecular cloud. We determined the dust emissivity
index using four different techniques to combine the Herschel PACS+SPIRE data
at 160 - 500 microns with the SCUBA-2 data at 450 microns and 850 microns. Of
our four techniques, we found the most robust method was to filter-out the
large-scale emission in the Herschel bands to match the spatial scales
recovered by the SCUBA-2 reduction pipeline. Using this method, we find beta ~
2 towards the filament region and moderately dense material and lower beta
values (beta > 1.6) towards the dense protostellar cores, possibly due to dust
grain growth. We find that beta and temperature are more robust with the
inclusion of the SCUBA-2 data, improving estimates from Herschel data alone by
factors of ~ 2 for beta and by ~ 40% for temperature. Furthermore, we find core
mass differences of < 30% compared to Herschel-only estimates with an adopted
beta = 2, highlighting the necessity of long wavelength submillimeter data for
deriving accurate masses of prestellar and protostellar cores.
