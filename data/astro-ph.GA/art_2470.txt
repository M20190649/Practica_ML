Supernova-driven gas accretion in the Milky Way
We use a model of the Galactic fountain to simulate the neutral-hydrogen
emission of the Milky Way Galaxy. The model was developed to account for data
on external galaxies with sensitive HI data. For appropriate parameter values,
the model reproduces well the HI emission observed at Intermediate Velocities.
The optimal parameters imply that cool gas is ionised as it is blasted out of
the disc, but becomes neutral when its vertical velocity has been reduced by
~30 per cent. The parameters also imply that cooling of coronal gas in the
wakes of fountain clouds transfers gas from the virial-temperature corona to
the disc at ~2 Mo/yr. This rate agrees, to within the uncertainties with the
accretion rate required to sustain the Galaxy's star formation without
depleting the supply of interstellar gas. We predict the radial profile of
accretion, which is an important input for models of Galactic chemical
evolution. The parameter values required for the model to fit the Galaxy's HI
data are in excellent agreement with values estimated from external galaxies
and hydrodynamical studies of cloud-corona interaction. Our model does not
reproduce the observed HI emission at High Velocities, consistent with High
Velocity Clouds being extragalactic in origin. If our model is correct, the
structure of the Galaxy's outer HI disc differs materially from that used
previously to infer the distribution of dark matter on the Galaxy's outskirts.
