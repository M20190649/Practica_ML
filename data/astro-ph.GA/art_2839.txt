Testing the initial conditions and dynamical evolution of star clusters
  using Gaia - I
We investigate how the properties of escaping stars are related to the
initial conditions of their birth clusters. We find that the number of escaping
stars, their spatial distribution, and their kinematics show a dependence on
the initial conditions of the host cluster (substructure and virial ratio).
Thus the properties of escaping stars can be used to inform us of the initial
conditions of star formation, and also provide a window into the dynamical
history of star clusters. The ESA Gaia mission will make observations of the
positions and proper motions of these escaping stars at the required accuracy
to allow us to investigate the dynamical evolution of local star clusters and
provide an important insight into the initial conditions of star formation.
