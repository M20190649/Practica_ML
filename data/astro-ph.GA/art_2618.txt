A Herschel Search For Cold Dust in Brown Dwarf Disks: First Results
We report initial results from a {\it Herschel} program to search for
far-infrared emission from cold dust around a statistically significant sample
of young brown dwarfs. The first three objects in our survey are all detected
at 70\micron, and we report the first detection of a brown dwarf at 160\micron.
The flux densities are consistent with the presence of substantial amounts of
cold dust in the outer disks around these objects. We modeled the SED's with
two different radiative transfer codes. We find that a broad range of model
parameters provides a reasonable fit to the SED's, but that the addition of our
70\micron, and especially the 160\micron\ detection enables strong lower limits
to be placed on the disk masses since most of the mass is in the outer disk. We
find likely disk masses in the range of a few $\times 10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$
\msun. Our models provide a good fit to the SED's and do not require dust
settling.
