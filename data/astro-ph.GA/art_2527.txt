Ionized Gas Kinematics and Morphology in Sgr B2 Main on 1000 AU Scales
We have imaged the Sgr B2 Main region with the Very Large Array in the BnA
configuration ($\theta_{beam}$ = 0\farcs13) in both the H52$\alpha$ (45.453
GHz) radio recombination line (RRL) and 7 mm continuum emission. At a distance
of 8500 pc, this spatial resolution corresponds to a physical scale of 0.005 pc
($\sim$1100 AU). The current observations detect H52$\alpha$ emission in 12
individual ultracompact (UC) and hypercompact (HC) HII regions. Two of the
sources with detected H52 $\alpha$ emission have broad
($\Delta$V$_{FWHM}\sim$50 \kms) recombination lines, and two of the sources
show lines with peaks at more than one velocity. We use line parameters from
the H52$\alpha$ lines and our previous H66$\alpha$ line observations to
determine the relative contribution of thermal, pressure and kinematic
broadening, and electron density. These new observations suggest that pressure
broadening can account for the broad lines in some of the sources, but that gas
motions (e.g. turbulence, accretion or outflow) contribute significantly to the
broad lines in at least one of the sources (Sgr B2 F3).
