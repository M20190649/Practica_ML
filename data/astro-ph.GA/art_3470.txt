The Disk Population of the Upper Scorpius Association
We present photometry at 3-24um for all known members of the Upper Scorpius
association (~11 Myr) based on all images of these objects obtained with the
Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We have
used these data to identify the members that exhibit excess emission from
circumstellar disks and estimate the evolutionary stages of these disks.
Through this analysis, we have found ~50 new candidates for transitional,
evolved, and debris disks. The fraction of members harboring inner primordial
disks is <10% for B--G stars (M>1.2 Msun) and increases with later types to a
value of ~25% at >=M5 (M<=0.2 Msun), in agreement with the results of previous
disk surveys of smaller samples of Upper Sco members. These data indicate that
the lifetimes of disks are longer at lower stellar masses, and that a
significant fraction of disks of low-mass stars survive for at least ~10 Myr.
Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of excess sizes in Upper Sco and
the much younger Taurus star-forming region (~1 Myr) are consistent with the
same, brief timescale for clearing of inner disks.
