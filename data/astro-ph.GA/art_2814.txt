Hypervelocity Planets and Transits Around Hypervelocity Stars
The disruption of a binary star system by the massive black hole at the
Galactic Centre, SgrA*, can lead to the capture of one star around SgrA* and
the ejection of its companion as a hypervelocity star (HVS). We consider the
possibility that these stars may have planets and study the dynamics of these
planets. Using a direct $N$-body integration code, we simulated a large number
of different binary orbits around SgrA*. For some orbital parameters, a planet
is ejected at a high speed. In other instances, a HVS is ejected with one or
more planets orbiting around it. In these cases, it may be possible to observe
the planet as it transits the face of the star. A planet may also collide with
its host star. In such cases the atmosphere of the star will be enriched with
metals. In other cases, a planet is tidally disrupted by SgrA*, leading to a
bright flare.
