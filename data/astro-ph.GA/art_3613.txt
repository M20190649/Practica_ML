An intermediate-band photometric study of the "Globular Cluster" NGC
  2419
NGC 2419 is one of the remotest star clusters in the Milky Way halo and its
exact nature is yet unclear: While it has traits reminiscent of a globular
cluster (GC), its large radius and suggestions of an abundance spread have
fueled the discussion about its origin in an extragalactic environment,
possibly the remnants of the accretion of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present
first results from deep intermediate-band photometry of NGC 2419, which enables
us to search for chemical (light element) abundance variations, metallicity
spreads, and thus multiple stellar populations through well calibrated
Stroemgren indices.
