Galaxies in box: A simulated view of the interstellar medium
We review progress in the development of physically realistic three
dimensional simulated models of the galaxy.We consider the scales from star
forming molecular clouds to the full spiral disc. Models are computed using
hydrodynamic (HD) or magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations and may include cosmic
ray or tracer particles. The range of dynamical scales between the full galaxy
structure and the turbulent scales of supernova (SN) explosions and even cloud
collapse to form stars, make it impossible with current computing tools and
resources to resolve all of these in one model. We therefore consider a
hierarchy of models and how they can be related to enhance our understanding of
the complete galaxy.
