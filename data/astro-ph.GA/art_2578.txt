Optical detection and spectroscopic confirmation of supernova remnant
  G213.0-0.6 (now re-designated as G213.3-0.4)
During a detailed search for optical counterparts of known Galactic supernova
remnants (SNRs) using the Anglo Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt
Telescope (AAO/UKST) HAlpha survey of the southern Galactic plane we have found
characteristic optical HAlpha filaments and associated emission in the area of
SNR G213.0-0.6. Although this remnant was previously detected in the radio as a
non-thermal source, we also confirm emission at 4850 MHz in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO
(PMN) survey and at 1400 MHz in the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). There is an
excellent match in morphological structure between the optical (HAlpha) and
radio emission. We subsequently obtained optical spectroscopy of selected
HAlpha filaments using the South African Astronomical Observatory 1.9-m
telescope which confirmed shock excitation typical of supernova remnants. Our
discovery of HAlpha emission and the positional match with several radio
frequency maps led us to reassign G213.0-0.6 as G213.3-0.4 as these
co-ordinates more accurately reflect the actual centre of the SNR shell and
hence the most probable place of the original supernova explosion. Support for
this new SNR ID comes from the fact that the X-ray source 1RXS J065049.7-003220
is situated in the centre of this new remnant and could be connected with the
supernova explosion.
