Analytical Studies of NGC 2571, NGC 6802, Koposov 53 and Be 89
Astrophysical parameters (age, reddening, distance, radius, luminosity
function, mass function, total mass, relaxation time and mass segregation) have
been estimated for open clusters NGC 2571, NGC 6802, Koposov 53 and Be 89 by
using the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry. We analyse the
color-magnitude diagrams and stellar radial density profiles. We have found
that NGC 2571 is the youngest one having young main sequence stars while Be 89
is the oldest cluster.
