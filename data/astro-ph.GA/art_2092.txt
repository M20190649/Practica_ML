Evolution of the Velocity Ellipsoids in the Thin Disk of the Galaxy and
  the Radial Migration of Stars
Data from the revised Geneva--Copenhagen catalog are used to study the
influence of radial migration of stars on the age dependences of parameters of
the velocity ellipsoids for nearby stars in the thin disk of the Galaxy,
assuming that the mean radii of the stellar orbits remain constant. It is
demonstrated that precisely the radial migration of stars, together with the
negative metallicity gradient in the thin disk,are responsible for the observed
negative correlation between the metallicities and angular momenta of nearby
stars, while the angular momenta of stars that were born at the same
Galactocentric distances do not depend on either age or metallicity. (abridged)
