Variables in Globular Cluster NGC 5024
We present the results of a commissioning campaign to observe Galactic
globular clusters for the search of microlensing events. The central 10' X 10'
region of the globular cluster NGC 5024 was monitored using the 2-m Himalayan
Chandra Telescope in R-band for a period of about 8 hours on 24 March 2010.
Light curves were obtained for nearly 10,000 stars, using a modified Difference
Image Analysis (DIA) technique. We identified all known variables within our
field of view and revised periods and status of some previously reported
short-period variables. We report about eighty new variable sources and present
their equatorial coordinates, periods, light curves and possible types. Out of
these, 16 are SX Phe stars, 10 are W UMa-type stars, 14 are probable RR Lyrae
stars and 2 are detached eclipsing binaries. Nine of the newly discovered SX
Phe stars and two eclipsing binaries belong to the Blue Straggler Star (BSS)
population.
