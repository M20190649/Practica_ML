Derivation of an Analytical Approximation of the Spectrum of Spinning
  Dust Emission
An analytical function for the spectrum of spinning dust emission is
presented. It is derived through the application of careful approximations,
with each step tested against numerical calculations. This approach ensures
accuracy while providing an intuitive picture of the physics. The final result
may be useful for fitting of anomalous microwave emission observations, as is
demonstrated by a comparison with the Planck observations of the Perseus
Molecular Cloud. It is hoped that this will lead to a broader consideration of
the spinning dust model when interpreting microwave continuum observations, and
that it will provide a standard framework for interpreting and comparing the
variety of anomalous microwave emission observations.
