Milky Way Demographics with the VVV Survey II. Color Transformations and
  Near-Infrared Photometry for 136 Million Stars in the Southern Galactic Disk
The new multi-epoch near-infrared VVV survey (VISTA Variables in the Via
Lactea) is sampling 562 sq. deg of the Galactic bulge and adjacent regions of
the disk. Accurate astrometry established for the region surveyed allows the
VVV data to be merged with overlapping surveys (e.g., GLIMPSE, WISE, 2MASS,
etc.), thereby enabling the construction of longer baseline spectral energy
distributions for astronomical targets. However, in order to maximize use of
the VVV data, a set of transformation equations are required to place the VVV
JHKs photometry onto the 2MASS system. The impetus for this work is to develop
those transformations via a comparison of 2MASS targets in 152 VVV fields
sampling the Galactic disk. The transformation coefficients derived exhibit a
reliance on variables such as extinction. The transformed data were
subsequently employed to establish a mean reddening law of
E_{J-H}/E_{H-Ks}=2.13 +/- 0.04, which is the most precise determination to date
and merely emphasizes the pertinence of the VVV data for determining such
important parameters.
