Subaru Spectroscopy and Spectral Modeling of Cygnus A
We present high angular resolution ($\sim$0.5$^\prime$$^\prime$) MIR spectra
of the powerful radio galaxy, Cygnus A, obtained with the Subaru telescope. The
overall shape of the spectra agree with previous high angular resolution MIR
observations, as well as previous Spitzer spectra. Our spectra, both on and off
nucleus, show a deep silicate absorption feature. The absorption feature can be
modeled with a blackbody obscured by cold dust or a clumpy torus. The deep
silicate feature is best fit by a simple model of a screened blackbody,
suggesting foreground absorption plays a significant, if not dominant role, in
shaping the spectrum of Cygnus A. This foreground absorption prevents a clear
view of the central engine and surrounding torus, making it difficult to
quantify the extent the torus attributes to the obscuration of the central
engine, but does not eliminate the need for a torus in Cygnus A.
