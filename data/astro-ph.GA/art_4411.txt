Nebular metallicities in two isolated Local Void dwarf galaxies
Isolated dwarf galaxies, especially those situated in voids, may provide
insight into primordial conditions in the Universe and the physical processes
that govern star formation in undisturbed stellar systems. The metallicity of H
ii regions in such galaxies is key to investigating this possibility. From the
SIGRID sample of isolated dwarf galaxies, we have identified two exceptionally
isolated objects, the Local Void galaxy [KK98]246 (ESO 461-G036) and another
somewhat larger dwarf irregular on the edge of the Local Void, MCG-01-41-006
(HIPASS J1609- 04). We report our measurements of the nebular metallicities in
these objects. The first object has a single low luminosity Hii region, while
the second is in a more vigorous star forming phase with several bright H ii
regions. We find that the metallicities in both galaxies are typical for
galaxies of this size, and do not indicate the presence of any primordial gas,
despite (for [KK98]246) the known surrounding large reservoir of neutral
Hydrogen.
