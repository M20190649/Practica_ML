Integral Field spectroscopy of two HI rich E+A galaxies
Approximately half of the nearby E+A galaxies followed up with 21-cm
observations have detectable HI emission. The optical spectra of these galaxies
show strong post-starburst stellar populations but no optical emission lines
implying star-formation is not ongoing despite the presence of significant gas
reservoirs. We have obtained integral field spectroscopic follow up
observations of the two brightest, and nearest, of the six E+A galaxies with HI
21-cm emission in the recent sample of Zwaan et al. (2013). In the central
regions of both galaxies the observations are consistent with a post-starburst
population with little emission. However, outside the central regions both
galaxies have strong optical emission lines, with a clumpy or knot-like
distribution, indicating ongoing star-formation. We conclude that in these two
cases the presence of optical spectra lacking evidence for star-formation while
a large gas mass is present can be explained by an aperture effect in selecting
the nearby E+A galaxies using single-fibre spectroscopy that probes only the
galaxy core.
