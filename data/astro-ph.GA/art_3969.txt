Hydrodynamical simulations of a compact source scenario for the Galactic
  Center cloud G2
The origin of the dense gas cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic Center
(Gillessen et al. 2012) is still a debated puzzle. G2 might be a diffuse cloud
or the result of an outflow from an invisible star embedded in it. We present
hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of different spherically symmetric
winds of a stellar object embedded in G2. We find that the interaction with the
ambient medium and with the extreme gravitational field of the supermassive
black hole in the Galactic Center must be taken into account for such a source
scenario. The thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines the
wind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with the
details depending on the wind parameters. Tidal forces squeeze the wind near
pericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. We also find that in
this scenario most of the Br\gamma\ luminosity is expected to come from the
densest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with low
filling factor. The observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate of
Mdot,w=8.8 x 10^{-8} Msun/yr and a wind velocity of vw = 50 km/s. These values
are compatible with those of a young T Tauri star wind, as already suggested by
(Scoville & Burkert 2013).
