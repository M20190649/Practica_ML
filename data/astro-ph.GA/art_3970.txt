Molecular cooling in the diffuse interstellar medium
We use a simple one-zone model of the thermal and chemical evolution of
interstellar gas to study whether molecular hydrogen (H2) is ever an important
coolant of the warm, diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). We demonstrate that at
solar metallicity, H2 cooling is unimportant and the thermal evolution of the
ISM is dominated by metal line cooling. At metallicities below 0.1 Z_solar,
however, metal line cooling of low density gas quickly becomes unimportant and
H2 can become the dominant coolant, even though its abundance in the gas
remains small. We investigate the conditions required in order for H2 to
dominate, and show that it provides significant cooling only when the ratio of
the interstellar radiation field strength to the gas density is small. Finally,
we demonstrate that our results are insensitive to changes in the initial
fractional ionization of the gas or to uncertainties in the nature of the dust
present in the low-metallicity ISM.
