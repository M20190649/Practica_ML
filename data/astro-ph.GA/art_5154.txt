The Herschel exploitation of local galaxy Andromeda (HELGA) V:
  Strengthening the case for substantial interstellar grain growth
In this paper we consider the implications of the distributions of dust and
metals in the disc of M31. We derive mean radial dust distributions using a
dust map created from Herschel images of M31 sampling the entire far-infrared
(FIR) peak. Modified blackbodies are fit to approximately 4000 pixels with a
varying, as well as a fixed, dust emissivity index (beta). An overall metal
distribution is also derived using data collected from the literature. We use a
simple analytical model of the evolution of the dust in a galaxy with dust
contributed by stellar sources and interstellar grain growth, and fit this
model to the radial dust-to-metals distribution across the galaxy. Our analysis
shows that the dust-to-gas gradient in M31 is steeper than the metallicity
gradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important in
M31. We argue that M31 helps build a case for cosmic dust in galaxies being the
result of substantial interstellar grain growth, while the net dust production
from stars may be limited. We note, however, that the efficiency of dust
production in stars, e.g., in supernovae (SNe) ejecta and/or stellar
atmospheres, and grain destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) may be
degenerate in our simple model. We can conclude that interstellar grain growth
by accretion is likely at least as important as stellar dust production
channels in building the cosmic dust component in M31.
