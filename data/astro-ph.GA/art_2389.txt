Analysing surveys of our Galaxy I: basic astrometric data
We consider what is the best way to extract science from large surveys of the
Milky Way galaxy. The diversity of data gathered in these surveys, together
with our position within the Galaxy, imply that science must be extracted by
fitting dynamical models to the data in the space of the observables. Models
based on orbital tori promise to be superior for this task than traditional
types of models, such as N-body models and Schwarzschild models. A formalism
that allows such models to be fitted to data is developed and tested on
pseudodata of varying richness.
