GS305+04-26:Revisiting the ISM around the CenOB1 stellar association
Massive stars deeply modify their surrounding ISM via their high throughput
of ionizing photons and their strong stellar winds. In this way they may create
large expanding structures of neutral gas. We study a new large HI shell,
labelled GS305+04-26, and its relationship with the OB association CenOB1. To
carry out this study we have used a multi-wavelenght approach. We analyze
neutral hydrogen (HI) line data retrieved from the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB)
survey, new spectroscopic optical observations obtained at CASLEO, and make use
of proper motion databases available via Internet. The analysis of the HI data
reveals a large expanding structure GS305+04-26 centered at
(l,b)=(305$^{\degr}$, +4$^{\degr}$) in the velocity range from -33 to -17 km/s.
Based on its central velocity, -26 km/s, and using standard galactic rotation
models, a distance of 2.5(+-)0.9 kpc is inferred. This structure, elliptical in
shape, has major and minor axis of 440 and 270 pc, respectively. Its expansion
velocity, total gaseous mass, and kinetic energy are ~8 km/s, (2.4(+-)0.5)x10^5
Mo, and (1.6(+-)0.4)x10^{50} erg, respectively. Several stars of the
OB-association CenOB1 are seen projected onto, and within, the boundaries of
GS305+04-26. Based on an analysis of proper motions, new members of CenOB1 are
identified. The mechanical energy injected by these stars could have been the
origin of this HI structure.
