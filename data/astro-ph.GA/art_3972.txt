Young Stellar Clusters with a Schuster Mass Distribution - I: Stationary
  Winds
Hydrodynamic models for spherically-symmetric winds driven by young stellar
clusters with a generalized Schuster stellar density profile are explored. For
this we use both semi-analytic models and 1D numerical simulations. We
determine the properties of quasi-adiabatic and radiative stationary winds and
define the radius at which the flow turns from subsonic into supersonic for all
stellar density distributions. Strongly radiative winds diminish significantly
their terminal speed and thus their mechanical luminosity is strongly reduced.
This also reduces their potential negative feedback into their host galaxy ISM.
The critical luminosity above which radiative cooling becomes dominant within
the clusters, leading to thermal instabilities which make the winds
non-stationary, is determined, and its dependence on the star cluster density
profile, core radius and half mass radius is discussed.
