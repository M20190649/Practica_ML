Infrared Variability of Evolved Protoplanetary Disks: Evidence for Scale
  Height Variations in the Inner Disk
We present the results of a multi-wavelength multi-epoch survey of five
evolved protoplanetary disks in the IC 348 cluster that show significant
infrared variability. Using 3-8micron and 24micron photometry along with
5-40micron spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as
ground-based 0.8-5micron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy and near-infrared
photometry, covering timescales of days to years, we examine the variability in
the disk, stellar and accretion flux. We find substantial variations (10-60%)
at all infrared wavelengths on timescales of weeks to months for all of these
young stellar objects. This behavior is not unique when compared to other
cluster members and is consistent with changes in the structure of the inner
disk, most likely scale height fluctuations on a dynamical timescale. Previous
observations, along with our near-infrared photometry, indicate that the
stellar fluxes are relatively constant; stellar variability does not appear to
drive the large changes in the infrared fluxes. Based on our near-infrared
spectroscopy of the Pa-beta and Br-gamma lines we find that the accretion rates
are variable in most of the evolved disks but the overall rates are probably
too small to cause the infrared variability. We discuss other possible physical
causes for the variability, including the influence of a companion, magnetic
fields threading the disk, and X-ray flares.
