Orbits of LMC/SMC with recent ground-based proper motions
In recent years, with new ground-based and HST measurements of proper motions
of the Magellanic Clouds being published, a need of a reanalysis of possible
orbital history has arisen. As complementary to other studies, we present a
partial examination of the parameter space -- aimed at exploring the
uncertainties in the proper motions of both Clouds, taking into account the
updated values of Galactic constants and Solar motion, which kinematically and
dynamically influence the orbits of the satellites. In the chosen setup of the
study, none of the binding scenarios of this pair could be neglected.
