Optical supernova remnants in nearby galaxies and their influence on
  star formation rates derived from H$Î±$ emission
In this paper we present the most up-to-date list of nearby galaxies with
optically detected supernova remnants (SNRs). We discuss the contribution of
the H{\alpha} flux from the SNRs to the total H{\alpha} flux and its influence
on derived star formation rate (SFR) for 18 galaxies in our sample. We found
that the contribution of SNRs' flux to the total H{\alpha} flux is 5 $\pm$ 5
per cent. Due to the observational selection effects, the SNRs contamination of
SFRs derived herein represents only a lower limit.
