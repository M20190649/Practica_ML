CCD BVRI and 2MASS Photometry of the Poorly Studied Open Cluster NGC
  6631
Here we have obtained the {\it BVRI CCD} photometry down to a limiting
magnitude of $V \sim$ 20 for the southern poorly studied open cluster NGC 6631.
It is observed from the {\it 1.88 m} Telescope of Kottamia Observatory in
Egypt. About 3300 stars have been observed in an area of $\sim 10^{\prime}
\times 10^{\prime}$ around the cluster center. The main photometric parameters
have been estimated and compared with the results that determined for the
cluster using {\it JHKs 2MASS} photometric database. The cluster's diameter is
estimated to be 10 arcmin; the reddening E(B-V)= 0.68 $\pm$ 0.10 mag, E(J-H)=
0.21 $\pm$ 0.10 mag, the true modulus (m-M)$_{o}$= 12.16 $\pm$ 0.10 mag, which
corresponds to a distance of 2700 $\pm$125 pc and age of 500 $\pm$ 50 Myr.
