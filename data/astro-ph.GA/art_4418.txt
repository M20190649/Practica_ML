Optically-Selected BLR-less Active Galactic Nuclei from the SDSS
  Stripe82 Database I: The Sample
This is the first paper in a dedicated series to study the properties of the
optically selected BLR-less AGNs (Active Galactic Nuclei with no-hidden central
broad emission line regions). We carried out a systematic search for the
BLR-less AGNs through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy Survey (SDSS Stripe82
Database). Based on the spectral decomposition results for all the 136676
spectroscopic objects (galaxies and QSOs) with redshift less than 0.35 covered
by the SDSS Stripe82 region, our spectroscopic sample for the BLR-less AGNs
includes 22693 pure narrow line objects without broad emission lines but with
apparent AGN continuum emission $R_{AGN}>0.3$ and apparent stellar lights
$R_{ssp}>0.3$. Then, using the properties of the photometry magnitude RMS
($RMS$) and the Pearson's coefficients ($R_{1, 2}$) between two different SDSS
band light curves: $RMS_k>3\times RMS_{M_k}$ and $R_{1, 2}>\sim0.8$, the final
281 pure narrow objects with true photometry variabilities are our selected
reliable candidates for the BLR-less AGNs. The selected candidates with higher
confidence levels not only have the expected spectral features of the BLR-less
AGNs, but also show significant true photometry variabilities. The reported
sample at least four-times enlarges the current sample of the BLR-less AGNs,
and will provide more reliable information to explain the lack of the BLRs of
AGNs in our following studies.
