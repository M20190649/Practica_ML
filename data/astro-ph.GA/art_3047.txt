Chaos in elliptical galaxies
Here I present a review of the work done on the presence and effects of chaos
in elliptical galaxies plus some recent results we obtained on this subject.
The fact that important fractions of the orbits that arise in potentials
adequate to represent elliptical galaxies are chaotic is nowadays undeniable.
Alternatively, it has been difficult to build selfconsistent models of
elliptical galaxies that include significant fractions of chaotic orbits and,
at the same time, are stable. That is specially true for cuspy models of
elliptical galaxies which seem to best represent real galaxies. I argue here
that there is no physical impediment to build such models and that the
difficulty lies in the method of Schwarzschild, widely used to obtain such
models. Actually, I show that there is no problem in obtaining selfconsistent
models of elliptical galaxies, even cuspy ones, that contain very high
fractions of chaotic orbits and are, nevertheless, highly stable over time
intervals of the order of a Hubble time.
