Dust effects on the derived Sersic indexes of disks and bulges in spiral
  galaxies
We present a theoretical study that quantifies the effect of dust on the
derived Sersic indexes of disks and bulges. The changes in the derived
parameters from their intrinsic values (as seen in the absence of dust) were
obtained by fitting Sersic distributions on simulated images of disks and
bulges produced using radiative transfer calculations and the model of Popescu
et al. 2011. We found that dust has the effect of lowering the measured Sersic
index in most cases, with stronger effects for disks and bulges seen through
more optically thick lines of sight.
