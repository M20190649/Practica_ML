Mid-J CO emission from the Orion BN/KL explosive outflow
High spatial resolution low-J 12CO observations have shown that the
wide-angle outflow seen in the Orion BN/KL region correlates with the famous H2
fingers. Recently, high-resolution large-scale mappings of mid- and higher-J CO
emissions have been reported toward the Orion molecular cloud 1 core region
using the APEX telescope. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate this
outflow in the higher-J 12CO emission, which is likely excited by shocks. The
observations were carried out using the dual-color heterodyne array CHAMP+ on
the APEX telescope. The images of the Orion BN/KL region were obtained in the
12CO J=6-5 and J=7-6 transitions with angular resolutions of 8.6 and 7.4
arcsec, respectively. The results show a good agreement between our higher-J
12CO emission and SMA low-J 12CO data, which indicates that this wide-angle
outflow in Orion BN/KL is likely the result of an explosive event that is
related to the runaway objects from a dynamically decayed multiple system. From
our observations, we estimate that the kinetic energy of this explosive outflow
is about 1-2x10^47 erg. In addition, a scenario has been proposed where part of
the outflow is decelerated and absorbed in the cloud to explain the lack of CO
bullets in the southern part of BN/KL, which in turn induces the methanol
masers seen in this region.
