New class I methanol masers
We review properties of all known collisionally pumped (class I) methanol
maser series based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) and the Mopra radio telescope. Masers at 36, 84, 44 and 95 GHz are most
widespread, while 9.9, 25, 23.4 and 104 GHz masers are much rarer, tracing the
most energetic shocks. A survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44 GHz
suggests that these two transitions are highly complementary. The 23.4 GHz
maser is a new type of rare class I methanol maser, detected only in two
high-mass star-forming regions, G357.97-0.16 and G343.12-0.06, and showing a
behaviour similar to 9.9, 25 and 104 GHz masers. Interferometric positions
suggest that shocks responsible for class I masers could arise from a range of
phenomena, not merely an outflow scenario. For example, some masers might be
caused by interaction of an expanding HII region with its surrounding molecular
cloud. This has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class I
methanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the
star-forming region. We also make predictions for candidate maser transitions
at the ALMA frequency range.
