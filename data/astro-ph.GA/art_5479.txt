A kinematically distinct core and minor-axis rotation: the MUSE
  perspective on M87
We present evidence for the presence of a low-amplitude kinematically
distinct component in the giant early-type galaxy M87, via datasets obtained
with the SAURON and MUSE integral-field spectroscopic units. The MUSE velocity
field reveals a strong twist of ~140 deg within the central 30 arcsec
connecting outwards such a kinematically distinct core to a prolate-like
rotation around the large-scale photometric major-axis of the galaxy. The
existence of these kinematic features within the apparently round central
regions of M87 implies a non-axisymmetric and complex shape for this galaxy,
which could be further constrained using the presented kinematics. The
associated orbital structure should be interpreted together with other tracers
of the gravitational potential probed at larger scales (e.g., Globular
Clusters, Ultra Compact Dwarfs, Planetary Nebulae): it would offer an insight
in the assembly history of one of the brightest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster.
These data also demonstrate the potential of the MUSE spectrograph to uncover
low-amplitude spectral signatures.
