Andromeda XXVIII: A Dwarf Galaxy More Than 350 kpc from Andromeda
We report the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, Andromeda XXVIII, using data
from the recently-released SDSS DR8. The galaxy is a likely satellite of
Andromeda, and, at a separation of $365^{+17}_{-1}$ kpc, would be one of the
most distant of Andromeda's satellites. Its heliocentric distance is
$650^{+150}_{-80}$ kpc, and analysis of its structure and luminosity show that
it has an absolute magnitude of $M_V = -8.5^{+0.4}_{-1.0}$ and half-light
radius of $r_h = 210^{+60}_{-50}$ pc, similar to many other faint Local Group
dwarfs. With presently-available imaging we are unable to determine if there is
ongoing or recent star formation, which prevents us from classifying it as a
dwarf spheroidal or dwarf irregular.
