Galactic kinematics of planetary nebulae with [WC] central star
High resolution spectra are used to analyze the galactic kinematics and
distribution of a sample of planetary nebulae with [WR] and 'wel' central star
([WR]PN and WLPN). The circular and peculiar velocities (Vpec) of the objects
were derived. The results are: a) [WR]PNe are distributed mainly in the
galactic disk and they are more concentrated in a thinner disk than WLPNe and
normal PNe, which corresponds to a younger population; b) the sample was
separated in Peimbert's types, and it is found that Type I PNe have Vpec <50 km
s-1, indicating young objects. Most of the [WR]PNe are of Type II showing Vpec
<60 km s-1, although a small percentage is of Type III, with larger Vpec
showing that the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon in central stars can occur at any
stellar mass and in old objects. None of our WLPNe is Type I. Thus, [WR]PNe and
WLPNe are unrelated objects.
