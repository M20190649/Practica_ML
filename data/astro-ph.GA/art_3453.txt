The Spitzer Space Telescope Survey of the Orion A & B Molecular Clouds -
  Part I: A Census of Dusty Young Stellar Objects and a Study of their Mid-IR
  Variability
We present a survey of the Orion A and B molecular clouds undertaken with the
IRAC and MIPS instruments onboard Spitzer. In total, five distinct fields were
mapped covering 9 sq. degrees in five mid-IR bands spanning 3-24 microns. The
survey includes the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Lynds 1641, 1630 and 1622 dark
clouds, and the NGC 2023, 2024, 2068 and 2071 nebulae. These data are merged
with the 2MASS point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight band
photometry. We identify 3479 dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion
molecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-IR colors indicative
of reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are
subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR colors and their spatial
distributions are presented. We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main sequence
stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most of the sources were
observed with IRAC in 2-3 epochs over 6 months; we search for variability
between the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5
micron bands. We find that 50% of the dusty YSOs show variability. The
variations are typically small (0.2 mag.) with the protostars showing a higher
incidence of variability and larger variations. The observed correlations
between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron variability suggests that we are
observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the
accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.
