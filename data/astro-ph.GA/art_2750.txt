The first outburst of the black hole candidate MAXI J1836-194 observed
  by INTEGRAL, Swift, and RXTE
MAXI J1836-194 is a transient black-hole candidate discovered in outburst by
MAXI on 30 August 2011. We report on the available INTEGRAL, Swift, and RXTE
observations performed in the direction of the source during this event before
55 864 MJD. Combining the broad band (0.6-200 keV) spectral and timing
information obtained from these data with the results of radio observations, we
show that the event displayed by MAXI J1836-194 is another example of "failed"
outburst. During the first ~20 days after the onset of the event, the source
underwent a transition from the canonical low/hard to the hard intermediate
state, while reaching the highest X-ray flux. In the ~40 days following the
peak of the outburst, the source displayed a progressive spectral hardening and
a decrease of the X-ray flux, thus it entered again the low/hard state and
began its return to quiescence.
