Stellar Mass Black Holes in Young Galaxies
We explore the potential cumulative energy production of stellar mass black
holes in early galaxies. Stellar mass black holes may accrete substantially
from the higher density interstellar media of primordial galaxies, and their
energy release would be distributed more uniformly over the galaxy, perhaps
providing a different mode of energy feedback into young galaxies than central
supermassive black holes. We construct a model for the production and growth of
stellar mass black holes over the first few gigayears of a young galaxy. With
the simplifying assumption of a constant density of the ISM, n ~ 10^4 - 10^5
per cubic centimeter, we estimate the number of accreting stellar mass black
holes to be ~ 10^6 and the potential energy production to be as high as 10^61
ergs over several billion years. For densities less than 10^5 per cubic
centimeter, stellar mass black holes are unlikely to reach their Eddington
limit luminosities. The framework we present could be incorporated in numerical
simulations to compute the feedback from stellar-mass black holes with
inhomogeneous, evolving interstellar media.
