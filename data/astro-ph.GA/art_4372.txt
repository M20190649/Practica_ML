Major Substructure in the M31 Outer Halo: the South-West Cloud
We undertake the first detailed analysis of the stellar population and
spatial properties of a diffuse substructure in the outer halo of M31. The
South-West Cloud lies at a projected distance of ~100 kpc from the centre of
M31, and extends for at least ~50 kpc in projection. We use Pan-Andromeda
Archaeological Survey photometry of red giant branch stars to determine a
distance to the South-West Cloud of 793 +/- 45 kpc. The metallicity of the
cloud is found to be [Fe/H] = -1.3 +/- 0.1. This is consistent with the
coincident globular clusters PAndAS-7 and PAndAS-8, which have metallicities
determined using an independent technique of [Fe/H] = -1.35 +/- 0.15. We
measure a brightness for the Cloud of M_V = -12.1 mag; this is ~75 per cent of
the luminosity implied by the luminosity-metallicity relation. Under the
assumption that the South-West Cloud is the visible remnant of an accreted
dwarf satellite, this suggests that the progenitor object was amongst M31's
brightest dwarf galaxies prior to disruption.
