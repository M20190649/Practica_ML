Modeling the dust emission from PN IC418
We construct a detailed model for the IR dust emission from the PN IC 418. We
succeed to reproduce the emission from 2 to 200$\mu$m. We can determine the
amount of emitting dust as well as its composition, and compare to the
depletion of elements determined for the photoionized region.
