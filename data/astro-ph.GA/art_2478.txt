The puzzling assembly of the Milky Way halo - contributions from dwarf
  Spheroidals and globular clusters
While recent sky surveys have uncovered large numbers of ever fainter Milky
Way satellites, their classification as star clusters, low-luminosity galaxies,
or tidal overdensities remains often unclear. Likewise, their contributions to
the build-up of the halo is yet debated. In this contribution we will discuss
the current knowledge of the stellar populations and chemo-dynamics in these
puzzling satellites, with a particular focus on dwarf spheroidal galaxies and
the globular clusters in the outer Galactic halo. Also the question of whether
some of the outermost halo objects are dynamically associated with the (Milky
Way) halo at all is addressed in terms of proper measurements in the remote Leo
I and II dwarf galaxies.
