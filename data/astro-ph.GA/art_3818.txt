Large-area [Fe II] Line Mapping of the Supernova Remnant IC443 with the
  IRSF/SIRIUS
We present the result of near-infrared (near-IR) [Fe II] line mapping of the
supernova remnant IC443 with the IRSF/SIRIUS, using the two narrow-band filters
tuned for the [Fe II] 1.257 micron and [Fe II] 1.644 micron lines. Covering a
large area of 30' x 35', our observations reveal that [Fe II] filamentary
structures exist all over the remnant, not only in an ionic shock shell, but
also in a molecular shock shell and a central region inside the shells. With
the two [Fe II] lines, we performed corrections for dust extinction to derive
the intrinsic line intensities. We also obtained the intensities of thermal
emission from the warm dust associated with IC443, using the far- and mid-IR
images taken with AKARI and Spitzer, respectively. As a result, we find that
the [Fe II] line emission relative to the dust emission notably enhances in the
inner central region. We discuss causes of the enhanced [Fe II] line emission,
estimating the Fe+ and dust masses.
