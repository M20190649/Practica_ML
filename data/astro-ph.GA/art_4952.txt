Constraining the vertical structure of the Milky Way rotation by
  microlensing in a finite-width global disk model
In this paper we model the vertical structure of mass distribution of the
Milky Way galaxy in the framework of a finite-width global disk model. Assuming
the Galactic rotation curve only, we test inside the solar orbit the
predictions of the model for two measurable and unrelated to each other
processes: the gravitational microlensing that allows to fix the disk
width-scale by the best fit to measurements, and the vertical gradient of
rotation modelled in the quasi-circular orbits approximation. The former is
sensitive to the gravitating mass in compact objects and the latter is
sensitive to all kinds of gravitating matter. The analysis points to a small
width-scale of the considered disks and, at most, insignificant contribution of
non-baryonic dark mater in the solar circle. The predicted high vertical
gradient values in the rotation are consistent with the gradient measurements.
