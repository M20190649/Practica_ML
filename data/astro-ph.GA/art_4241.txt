UB CCD photometry of the old, metal rich, open clusters NGC 6791, NGC
  6819 and NGC 7142
We report on a UV-oriented imaging survey in the fields of the old,
metal-rich open clusters, NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 7142. These three clusters
represent both very near and ideal stellar aggregates to match the distinctive
properties of the evolved stellar populations, as in elliptical galaxies and
bulges of spirals. The CMD of the three clusters is analyzed in detail, with
special emphasis to the hot stellar component. We report, in this regard, one
new extreme horizontal-branch star candidate in NGC 6791. For NGC 6819 and
7142, the stellar luminosity function points to a looser radial distribution of
faint lower Main Sequence stars, either as a consequence of cluster dynamical
interaction with the Galaxy or as an effect of an increasing fraction of binary
stars toward the cluster core, as actually observed in NGC 6791 too.
