On the Galactic aberration constant
In this work, we analyzed all available determinations of the Galactic
rotation parameters $R_0$ and $\Omega_0$ made during last 10 years to derive
the most probable value of the Galactic aberration constant $A = R_0
\Omega_0^2/c$. We used several statistical methods to obtain reliable estimates
of $R_0$ and $\Omega_0$ and their realistic errors. In result, we have obtained
the value of $A = 5.0 \pm 0.3$ $\mu$as/yr as the current best estimate of the
GA constant. We suggest that the proposed value of the GA constant can be
safely used in practice during coming years.
