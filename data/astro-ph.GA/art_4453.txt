Influence of the cosmic repulsion on the MOND model of the Magellanic
  Cloud motion in the field of Milky Way
It has been recently shown that the cosmic repulsion can have a highly
significant influence on the motion of Magellanic Clouds (MC) in the
gravitational field of Milky Way, treated in the framework of the Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) halo model. However, there is an alternative to the CDM halo
explanation of the rotation curves in the periphery of spiral galaxies, based
on MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Therefore, we study the role of the
cosmic repulsion in the framework of the MOND theory applied to determine the
MC motion. Our results demonstrate that in the MOND framework the influence of
the cosmic repulsion on the motion of both Small and Large MC is also highly
significant, but it is of a different character than in the framework of the
CDM halo model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the MC motion in the framework of
the CDM halo and MOND models is subtantially different and can serve as a test
of these fundamentally different approaches to the explanation of the phenomena
related to galaxies and the motion of satellite galaxies.
