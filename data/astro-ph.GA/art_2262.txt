A Fossil Bulge Globular Cluster revealed by VLT Multi-Conjugate Adaptive
  Optics
The globular cluster HP1 is projected on the bulge, very close to the
Galactic center. The Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) Demonstrator (MAD)
at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed to acquire high resolution deep
images that, combined with first epoch New Technology Telescope (NTT) data,
enabled to derive accurate proper motions. The cluster and bulge field stellar
contents were disentangled by means of this process, and produced unprecedented
definition in the color-magnitude diagrams for this cluster. The metallicity of
[Fe/H] ~ -1.0 from previous spectroscopic analysis is confirmed, which together
with an extended blue horizontal branch, imply an age older than the halo
average. Orbit reconstruction results suggest that HP1 is spatially confined
within the bulge.
