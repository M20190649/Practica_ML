A comparison between the stellar and dynamical masses of six globular
  clusters
We present the results of a comprehensive analysis of the structure and
kinematics of six Galactic globular clusters. By comparing the results of the
most extensive photometric and kinematical surveys available to date with
suited dynamical models, we determine the stellar and dynamical masses of these
stellar systems taking into account for the effect of mass segregation,
anisotropy and unresolved binaries. We show that the stellar masses of these
clusters are on average smaller than those predicted by canonical integrated
stellar evolution models because of the shallower slope of their mass
functions. The derived stellar masses are found to be also systematically
smaller than the dynamical masses by ~40%, although the presence of systematics
affecting our estimates cannot be excluded. If confirmed, this evidence can be
linked to an increased fraction of retained dark remnants or to the presence of
a modest amount of dark matter.
