Special Shapes for Optimal Phenomenological Approximations of
  Astronomical Signals
We discuss different methods for phenomenological approximations of signals
with (generally) irregularly spaced arguments. Such signals may be classified
as periodic, multi-periodic, quasi-periodic (cyclic), burst-type and
flicker-type (see e.g. a review by Andronov (2003)). In this talk, we
concentrate on (nearly) periodic light curves of the Algol-type eclipsing
variables. Having no possibility to determine all physical parameters for all
stars and to make physical modeling, the phenomenological fits are used. This
is especially important for discovery papers, when there are often available
only mono-chromatic photometric data, without estimates of temperature and
orbital velocities of the components.
