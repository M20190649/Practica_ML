How Starless Are Starless Cores?
In this paper, we present the results of CARMA continuum and spectral line
observations of the dense core Per-Bolo 45. Although this core has previously
been classified as starless, we find evidence for an outflow and conclude that
Per-Bolo 45 is actually an embedded, low-luminosity protostar. We discuss the
impact of newly discovered, low-luminosity, embedded objects in the Perseus
molecular cloud on starless core and protostar lifetimes. We estimate that the
starless core lifetime has been overestimated by 4-18% and the Class 0/I
protostellar lifetime has been underestimated by 5-20%. Given the relatively
large systematic uncertainties involved in these calculations, variations on
the order of 10% do not significantly change either core lifetimes or the
expected protostellar luminosity function. Finally, we suggest that high
resolution (sub)millimeter surveys of known cores lacking near-infrared and
mid-infrared emission are necessary to make an accurate census of starless
cores.
