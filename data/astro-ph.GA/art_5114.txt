ATLASGAL --- Complete compact source catalogue: 280\degr\ $ <\ell <$
  60\degr
The APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL) is the largest
and most sensitive systematic survey of the inner Galactic plane in the
submillimetre wavelength regime. The observations were carried out with the
Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA), an array of 295 bolometers observing at
870\,$\mu$m (345 GHz). Aim: In this research note we present the compact source
catalogue for the 280\degr\ $ <\ell <$ 330\degr\ and 21\degr\ $ <\ell <$
60\degr\ regions of this survey. Method: The construction of this catalogue was
made with the source extraction routine \sex\ using the same input parameters
and procedures used to analyse the inner Galaxy region presented in an earlier
publication (i.e., 330\degr\ $ <\ell <$ 21\degr). Results: We have identified
3523 compact sources and present a catalogue of their properties. When combined
with the regions already published this provides a comprehensive and unbiased
database of ~10163 massive, dense clumps located across the inner Galaxy.
