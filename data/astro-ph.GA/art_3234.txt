ALMA observations of the outflow from the Source I in the Orion-KL
  region
In this {\it Letter}, we present sensitive millimeter SiO (J=5-4; $\nu$=0)
line observations of the outflow arising from the enigmatic object Orion Source
I made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The
observations reveal that at scales of a few thousand AU, the outflow has a
marked "butterfly" morphology along a northeast-southwest axis. However,
contrary to what is found in the SiO and H$_2$O maser observations at scales of
tens of AU, the blueshifted radial velocities of the moving gas are found to
the northwest, while the redshifted velocities are in the southeast. The ALMA
observations are complemented with SiO (J=8-7; $\nu$=0) maps (with a similar
spatial resolution) obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). These
observations also show a similar morphology and velocity structure in this
outflow. We discuss some possibilities to explain these differences at small
and large scales across the flow.
