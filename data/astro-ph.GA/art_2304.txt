On the pulse-width statistics in radio pulsars. II. Importance of the
  core profile components
We performed a statistical analysis of half-power pulse-widths of the core
components in average pulsar profiles. We confirmed an existence of the lower
bound of the distribution of half-power pulse-width versus the pulsar period
W50~2.45deg P^(-0.5) found by Rankin (1990). Using our much larger database we
found W50= (2.51 +/- 0.08)deg P^(-0.50 +/-0.02) for 21 pulsars with double-pole
interpulses for which measurement of the core component width was possible. On
the other hand, all single-pole interpulse cases lie in the swarm of pulsars
above the boundary line. Using the Monte Carlo simulations based on exact
geometrical calculations we found that the Rankin's method of estimation of the
inclination angle alpha ~ asin(2.45deg P^(-0.5)/W50) in pulsars with core
components is quite good an approximation, except for very small angles alpha
in almost aligned rotators.
