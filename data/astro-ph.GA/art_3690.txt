Study of ram pressure effects on NGC 2805 in Holmberg 124
In this paper we present new H{\sc i} 21cm spectral line images of the poor
group of late type galaxies, Holmberg 124 made using archival data from the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Holmberg 124 is a group of four late
type galaxies: NGC 2805, NGC 2814, NGC 2820 and Mrk 108. We detect spectral
line emission from all the four galaxies and note several signatures of tidal
interactions among the member galaxies. Our results for the triplet (namely NGC
2820, NGC 2814 and Mrk 108) confirm the earlier results of Kantharia et al.
(2005) notably the detection of a possible tidal dwarf galaxy to the north-east
of NGC 2820. Further, in these images where the pointing center of the
observations was changed, we have recovered most of the H{\sc i} emission in
NGC 2805 as compared to Kantharia et al. (2005). We also report possible
detection of small discrete clouds between NGC 2820 and NGC 2805 which might be
stripped H{\sc i} in the intragroup medium (IGrM). However, these need
confirmation.
