New HI scaling relations to probe the HI content of galaxies via global
  HI-deficiency maps
We present new multi-wavelength scaling relations between the neutral
hydrogen content (HI) and the stellar properties of nearby galaxies selected
from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS). We use these new scaling relations
to investigate the environmental dependency of the HI content of galaxies. We
find that galaxies in high density environments tend to have on average less HI
than galaxies with the same stellar mass in the low density environment. Our
new HI scaling relations allow us to identify individual galaxies, as well as
group/cluster environments, that have an `anomalous' HI content. We map the
global distribution of HI-deficient and HI-excess galaxies on the sky and
compare it to the large scale structure of galaxies. We find galaxy clusters to
be HI-deficient, and we identify that the regions surrounding clusters tend to
be HI-excess. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of using HI scaling
relations to predict future HI surveys based on an optical redshift survey. We
apply our scaling relations to 16709 galaxies in the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS)
that lie in the HIPASS volume and compare our predictions to the measurements.
We find that scaling relations are good method to estimate the outcome of HI
surveys.
