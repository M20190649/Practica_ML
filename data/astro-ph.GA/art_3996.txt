Detection of the Ammonium Ion in Space
We report on the detection of a narrow feature at 262816.73 MHz towards Orion
and the cold prestellar core B1-bS, that we attribute to the 1(0)-0(0) line of
the deuterated Ammonium ion, NH3D+. The observations were performed with the
IRAM 30m radio telescope. The carrier has to be a light molecular species as it
is the only feature detected over 3.6 GHz of bandwidth. The hyperfine structure
is not resolved indicating a very low value for the electric quadrupolar
coupling constant of Nitrogen which is expected for NH3D+ as the electric field
over the N nucleus is practically zero. Moreover, the feature is right at the
predicted frequency for the 1(0)-0(0) transition of the Ammonium ion, 262817(6)
MHz (3sigma), using rotational constants derived from new infrared data
obtained in our laboratory in Madrid. The estimated column density is
1.1(0.2)e12 cm-2. Assuming a deuterium enhancement similar to that of NH2D, we
derive N(NH4+) sim 2.6e13 cm-2, i.e., an abundance for Ammonium of a few
1e(-11).
