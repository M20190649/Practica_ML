No evidence of dark matter in the solar neighborhood
We measured the surface mass density of the Galactic disk at the solar
position, up to 4 kpc from the plane,by means of the kinematics of ~400 thick
disk stars. The results match the expectations for the visible mass only, and
no dark matter is detected in the volume under analysis. The current models of
dark matter halo are excluded with a significance higher than 5sigma, unless a
highly prolate halo is assumed, very atypical in cold dark matter simulations.
The resulting lack of dark matter at the solar position challenges the current
models.
