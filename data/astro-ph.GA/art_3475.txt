Star Formation and Dust Extinction Properties of Local Galaxies as seen
  from AKARI and GALEX
An accurate estimation of the star formation-related properties of galaxies
is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. In galaxies,
ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by recently formed massive stars is attenuated
by dust, which is also produced by star formation (SF) activity, and is
reemitted at mid- and far- infrared (IR) wavelengths. In this study, we
investigate the star formation rate (SFR) and dust extinction using UV and IR
data. We selected local galaxies which are detected at AKARI FIS 90 um and
matched the IRAS IIFSCz 60 um select catalog. We measured FUV and NUV flux
densities from GALEX images. We examined the SF and extinction of Local
galaxies using four bands of AKARI. Then, we calculated FUV and total IR
luminosities, and obtained the SF luminosity, L_{SF}, the total luminosity
related to star formation activity, and the SFR. We find that in most galaxies,
L_{SF} is dominated by L_{dust}. We also find that galaxies with higher SF
activity have a higher fraction of their SF hidden by dust. In fact, the SF of
galaxies with SFRs >20 M_{sun}/yr is almost completely hidden by dust. Our
results boast a significantly higher precision with respect to previously
published works, due to the use of much larger object samples from the AKARI
and GALEX all sky surveys.
