Interacting Galactic Neutral Hydrogen Filaments and Associated
  High-Frequency Continuum Emission
Galactic HI emission profiles in an area where several large-scale filaments
at velocities ranging from -46 km/s to 0 km/s overlap were decomposed into
Gaussian components. Eighteen families of components defined by similarities of
center velocity and line width were identified and related to small-scale
structure in the high-frequency continuum emission observed by the WMAP
spacecraft, as evidenced in the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map of
Hinshaw et al. (2007). When the center velocities of the Gaussian families,
which summarize the properties of all the HI along the lines-of-sight in a
given area, are used to focus on HI channel maps the phenomenon of close
associations between HI and ILC peaks reported in previous papers is
dramatically highlighted. Of particular interest, each of two pairs of HI peaks
straddles a continuum peak. The previously hypothesized model for producing the
continuum radiation (Verschuur, 2010) involving free-free emission from
electrons is re-examined in the light of the new data. By choosing reasonable
values for the parameters required to evaluate the model, the distance for
associated HI-ILC features is of order 30 to 100 pc. No associated H-alpha
radiation is expected because the electrons involved exist throughout the Milky
Way. The mechanism for clumping and separation of neutrals and electrons needs
to be explored.
