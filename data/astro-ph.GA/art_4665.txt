Equipartition magnetic fields and star formation rates in normal
  galaxies at sub-kpc scales
We studied the total magnetic field strength in normal star-forming galaxies
estimated using energy equipartition assumption. Using the well known
radio--far infrared correlation we demonstrate that the equipartition
assumption is valid in galaxies at sub-kpc scales. We find that the magnetic
field strength is strongly correlated with the surface star formation rate in
the galaxies NGC 6946 and NGC 5236. Further, we compare the magnetic field
energy density to the total (thermal + turbulent) energy densities of gas
(neutral + ionized) to identify regions of efficient field amplification in the
galaxy NGC 6946. We find that in regions of efficient star formation, the
magnetic field energy density is comparable to that of the total energy density
of various interstellar medium components and systematically dominates in
regions of low star formation efficiency.
