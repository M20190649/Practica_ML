A Complete Atlas of HI Absorption toward HII Regions in the Southern
  Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS1)
We present a complete catalog of H I emission and absorption spectrum pairs,
toward H II regions, detectable within the boundaries of the Southern Galactic
Plane Survey (SGPS I), a total of 252 regions. The catalog is presented in
graphical, numerical and summary formats. We demonstrate an application of this
new dataset through an investigation of the locus of the Near 3kpc Arm.
