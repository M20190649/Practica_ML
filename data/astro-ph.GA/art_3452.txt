The central density of R136 in 30 Doradus
The central density rho_0 of a stellar cluster is an important physical
parameter for determining its evolutionary and dynamical state. How much mass
segregation there is, or whether the cluster has undergone core collapse both
depends on rho_0. We reanalyze the results of a previous paper that gives the
mass density profile of R136 and combine them with both a conservative upper
limit for the core parameter and a more uncertain recent measurement. We thus
place a lower limit on rho_0 under reasonable and defensible assumptions about
the IMF, finding rho_0 >~ 1.5x10^4 Msun/pc^3 for the conservative assumption a
< 0.4 pc for the cluster core parameter. If we use the lower, but more
uncertain value a = 0.025 pc, the central density estimate becomes greater than
10^7 Msun/pc^3. A mechanism based on the destruction of a large number of
circumstellar disks is posited to explain the hitherto unexplained increase in
reddening presented in that same work.
