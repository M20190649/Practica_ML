Physical properties of outflows: Comparing CO and H2O based parameters
  in Class 0 sources
Context. The observed physical properties of outflows from low-mass sources
put constraints on possible ejection mechanisms. Historically, these quantities
have been derived from CO using ground-based observations. It is thus important
to investigate whether parameters such as momentum rate (thrust) and mechanical
luminosity (power) are the same when different molecular tracers are used.
Aims. We aim at determining the outflow momentum, dynamical time-scale, thrust,
energy and power using CO and H2O as tracers of outflow activity. Methods.
Within the framework of the WISH key program, three molecular outflows from
Class 0 sources have been mapped using the HIFI instrument aboard Herschel. We
use these observations together with previously published H2 data to infer the
physical properties of the outflows. We compare the physical properties derived
here with previous estimates based on CO observations. Results. Inspection of
the spatial distribution of H2O and H2 confirms that these molecules are
co-spatial. The most prominent emission peaks in H2 coincide with strong H2O
emission peaks and the estimated widths of the flows when using the two tracers
are comparable. Conclusions. For the momentum rate and the mechanical
luminosity, inferred values are independent of which tracer that is used, i.e.,
the values agree to within a factor of 4 and 3 respectively.
