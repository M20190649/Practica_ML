Photodissociation of interstellar N2
Molecular nitrogen is one of the key species in the chemistry of interstellar
clouds and protoplanetary disks and the partitioning of nitrogen between N and
N2 controls the formation of more complex prebiotic nitrogen-containing
species. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of the
interstellar N2 photodissociation processes based on recent detailed
theoretical and experimental work and to provide accurate rates for use in
chemical models.
  We simulated the full high-resolution line-by-line absorption + dissociation
spectrum of N2 over the relevant 912-1000 \AA\ wavelength range, by using a
quantum-mechanical model which solves the coupled-channels Schr\"odinger
equation. The simulated N2 spectra were compared with the absorption spectra of
H2, H, CO, and dust to compute photodissociation rates in various radiation
fields and shielding functions. The effects of the new rates in interstellar
cloud models were illustrated for diffuse and translucent clouds, a dense
photon dominated region and a protoplanetary disk.
