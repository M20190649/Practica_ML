Stochasticity effects on derivation of physical parameters of unresolved
  star clusters
We developed a method for a fast modeling of broad-band UBVRI integrated
magnitudes of unresolved star clusters and used it to derive their physical
parameters (age, mass, and extinction). The method was applied on M33 galaxy
cluster sample and consistency of ages and masses derived from unresolved
observations with the values derived from resolved stellar photometry was
demonstrated. We found that interstellar extinction causes minor age-extinction
degeneracy for the studied sample due to a narrow extinction range in M33.
