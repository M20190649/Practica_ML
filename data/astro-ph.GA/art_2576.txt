AMI observations of unmatched Planck ERCSC LFI sources at 15.75 GHz
The Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue includes 26 sources with no
obvious matches in other radio catalogues (of primarily extragalactic sources).
Here we present observations made with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Small
Array (AMI SA) at 15.75 GHz of the eight of the unmatched sources at
declination > +10 degrees. Of the eight, four are detected and are associated
with known objects. The other four are not detected with the AMI SA, and are
thought to be spurious.
