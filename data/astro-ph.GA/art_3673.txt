Origin of the dense core mass function in contracting filaments
Mass functions of starless dense cores (CMFs) may arise from contraction and
dispersal of core-forming filaments. In an illustrative model, a filament
contracts radially by self-gravity, increasing the mass of its cores. During
this contraction, FUV photoevaporation and ablation by shocks and winds
disperse filament gas and limit core growth. The stopping times of core growth
are described by a waiting-time distribution. The initial filament column
density profile and the resulting CMF each match recent Herschel observations
in detail. Then low-mass cores have short growth ages and arise from the
innermost filament gas, while massive cores have long growth ages and draw from
more extended filament gas. The model fits the initial density profile and CMF
best for mean core density 2 10^4 cm^-3 and filament dispersal time scale 0.5
Myr. Then the typical core mass, radius, mean column density, and contraction
speed are respectively 0.8 solar masses, 0.06 pc, 6 10^21 cm^-2, and 0.07 km
s^-1, also in accord with observed values.
