Progress in Understanding the Diffuse UV Cosmic Background
I report on progress in my ongoing work with Professor Jayant Murthy
concerning the origin and nature of the diffuse ultraviolet background
radiation over the sky. We have obtained and are reducing a vast trove of
Voyager ultraviolet spectrometer observations of the diffuse background
shortward of Lyman alpha, including for the first time measurements made from
the outermost regions of the solar system, where noise from solar-system
scattered (and then grating-scattered) solar Lyman alpha is lowest. Also, we
have obtained and are investigating the complete set of GALEX observations of
the diffuse ultraviolet background longward of Lyman alpha. Preliminary
investigation appears to confirm that longward of Lyman alpha there exists a
component of the diffuse ultraviolet background that is not dust-scattered
starlight.
