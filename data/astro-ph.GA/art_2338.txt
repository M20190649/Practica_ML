The field of Loden 112
Based on the available uvbybeta photometry of OB stars in the longitude range
281 - 285 deg in the Galactic disk, we identify a feature of young stars at
1630+/-82 pc, that is probably connected to the compact cluster candidate Loden
112 and the open cluster IC 2581. This feature seems to be spatially correlated
to RCW 48 and RCW 49 and several other smaller HII regions.
