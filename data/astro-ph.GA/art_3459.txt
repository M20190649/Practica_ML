CO J=2-1 Observations toward the Supernova Remnant G54.1+0.3
We present 12CO J = 2-1 line observations of G54.1+0.3, a composite supernova
remnant with a mid-infrared (MIR) loop surrounding the central pulsar wind
nebula (PWN). We mapped an area of 12' x 9' around the PWN and its associated
MIR loop. We confirm two velocity components that had been proposed to be
possibly interacting with the PWN/MIR-loop; the +53 km/s cloud that appears in
contact with the eastern boundary of the PWN and the +23 km/s cloud that has CO
emission coincident with the MIR loop. We have not found a direct evidence for
the interaction in either of these clouds. Instead, we detected an 5'-long
arc-like cloud at +15-+23 km/s with a systematic velocity gradient of ~3
km/s/arcmin and broad-line emitting CO gas having widths (FWHM) of <7 km/s in
the western interior of the supernova remnant. We discuss their association
with the supernova remnant.
