On the fate of the matter reinserted within young nuclear stellar
  clusters
This paper presents a hydrodynamical model describing the evolution of the
gas reinserted by stars within a rotating young nuclear star cluster (NSC). We
explicitly consider the impact of the stellar component to the flow by means of
a uniform insertion of mass and energy within the stellar cluster. The model
includes the gravity force of the stellar component and a central supermassive
black hole (SMBH), and accounts for the heating from the central source of
radiation and the radiative cooling of the thermalized gas. By using a set of
parameters typical for NSCs and SMBHs in Seyfert galaxies our simulations show
that a filamentary/clumpy structure is formed in the inner part of the cluster.
This "torus" is Compton thick and covers a large fraction of the sky (as seen
from the SMBH). In the outer parts of the cluster a powerful wind is produced,
that inhibits the infall of matter from larger scales and thus the NSC-SMBH
interplay occurs in isolation.
