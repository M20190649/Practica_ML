Constraining the Flaring Region of Sagittarius A* By 1.3mm VLBI
  Measurements
We use a model of an accretion flow coupled with an emergent flare to
interpret the latest 1.3mm VLBI measurements for Sagittarius A*. The visibility
data constrained the distances from the flare center to the black hole center
as $d_{\rm EW}\lesssim20{\rm R_g}$ and $d_{\rm NS}\lesssim80{\rm R_g}$ in the
East-West and North-South directions, respectively. If interpreted by the
hot-spot model, the flare was preferred to pass in front of the black hole at a
radius much larger than $d_{\rm EW}$. If interpreted by the episodic jet
launched from a nearly edge-on hot accretion flow, the flare was preferred to
be ejected with $\theta_{\rm j}\gtrsim40^\circ$ off the black hole rotating
axis. This method can be generalized to help us understand future
sub-millimeter VLBI observations, and study the millimeter/sub-millimeter
variabilities in the vicinity of the Galactic Center supermassive black hole.
