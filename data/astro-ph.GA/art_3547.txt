Rapid Mass Segregation in Massive Star Clusters
Several dynamical scenarios have been proposed that can lead to prompt mass
segregation on the crossing time scale of a young cluster. They generally rely
on cool and/or clumpy initial conditions, and are most relevant to small
systems. As a counterpoint, we present a novel dynamical mechanism that can
operate in relatively large, homogeneous, cool or cold systems. This mechanism
may be important in understanding the assembly of large mass-segregated
clusters from smaller clumps.
