Magnetic fields and star formation as seen in edge-on galaxies
Radio continuum and polarization observations of several nearby galaxies
allowed to determine their vertical scaleheights, magnetic field strengths and
large-scale magnetic field patterns. They all show a similar large-scale
magnetic field pattern, which is parallel to the galactic disk along the
midplane and X-shaped further away from the disk plane, indepenent of their
Hubble type or star formation in the disk or nuclear region. We conclude that -
though a high star formation rate (SFR) in the disk increases the total
magnetic field strength in the disk and the halo - the SFR does not
significantly change the global field configuration nor influence the global
scale heights of the radio emission. The observed similar scale heights
indicate that star formation regulates the galactic wind velocities. The
galactic wind itself may be essential for an effective dynamo action.
