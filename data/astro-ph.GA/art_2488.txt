Selecting High-Precision Photometry on Uniform Zero Points for Five
  Benchmark Galactic Clusters
This paper reviews results from two projects designed to yield photometry on
uniform zero points for five clusters--Coma, the Hyades, M67, NGC 752, and
Praesepe. Contributing papers for a project on Cousins VRI photometry and a
project on Stromgren-beta photometry are listed. Results of zero point tests of
the photometry are reviewed, and their character is found to be satisfactory at
the level of a few mmag. Responses to extant criticisms of the photometry are
offered, and a section on B-V photometry for the five clusters is included.
Because the results of the projects suggest that certain changes should be made
in current perspectives on photometry, those changes are reviewed. Finally,
suggestions are made about future uses of data from the projects.
