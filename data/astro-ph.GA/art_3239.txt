Small-scale hero: massive-star enrichment in the Hercules dwarf
  spheroidal
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are often conjectured to be the sites of the first
stars. The best current contenders for finding the chemical imprints from the
enrichment by those massive objects are the "ultrafaint dwarfs" (UFDs). Here we
present evidence for remarkably low heavy element abundances in the metal poor
Hercules UFD. Combined with other peculiar abundance patterns this indicates
that Hercules was likely only influenced by very few, massive explosive events
- thus bearing the traces of an early, localized chemical enrichment with only
very little other contributions from other sources at later times.
