Small-scale structure of the interstellar medium towards rho Oph stars:
  diffuse band observations
We present an investigation of small-scale-structure in the distribution of
large molecules/dust in the interstellar medium through observations of diffuse
interstellar bands (DIBs). High signal-to-noise optical spectra were recorded
towards the stars rho Oph A, B, C and DE using the University College London
Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The strengths
of some of the DIBs are found to differ by about 5-9 % between the close binary
stars rho Oph A and B, which are separated by a projected distance on the sky
of only ~344 AU. This is the first star-system in which such small-scale DIB
strength variations have been reported. The observed variations are attributed
to differences between a combination of carrier abundance and the physical
conditions present along each sightline. The sightline towards rho Oph C
contains relatively dense, molecule-rich material and has the strongest
\lambda\lambda 5850 and 4726 DIBs. The gas towards DE is more diffuse and is
found to exhibit weak C_2 (blue) DIBs and strong yellow/red DIBs. The
differences in diffuse band strengths between lines of sight are, in some
cases, significantly greater in magnitude than the corresponding variations
among atomic and diatomic species, indicating that the DIBs can be sensitive
tracers of interstellar cloud conditions.
