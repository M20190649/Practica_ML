Discovery of 6.035GHz Hydroxyl Maser Flares in IRAS18566+0408
We report the discovery of 6.035GHz hydroxyl (OH) maser flares toward the
massive star forming region IRAS18566+0408 (G37.55+0.20), which is the only
region known to show periodic formaldehyde (4.8 GHz H2CO) and methanol (6.7 GHz
CH3OH) maser flares. The observations were conducted between October 2008 and
January 2010 with the 305m Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico. We detected two
flare events, one in March 2009, and one in September to November 2009. The OH
maser flares are not simultaneous with the H2CO flares, but may be correlated
with CH3OH flares from a component at corresponding velocities. A possible
correlated variability of OH and CH3OH masers in IRAS18566+0408 is consistent
with a common excitation mechanism (IR pumping) as predicted by theory.
