The AKARI FIS YSO Catalogue
We demonstrate the use of the AKARI survey photometric data in the study of
galactic star formation. Our aim was to select young stellar objects (YSOs) in
the AKARI FIS catalogue. We used AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor and Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer data to derive mid- and far-infrared colours of YSOs.
Classification schemes based on Quadratic Discriminant Analysis have been given
for YSOs. The training catalogue for QDA was the whole sky selection of
previously known YSOs (i.e. listed in SIMBAD). A new catalogue of AKARI FIS YSO
candidates including 44001 sources has been prepared. Reliability of the
classification is over 90% as tested in comparison to known YSOs. As much as
76% of our YSO candidates are from previously uncatalogued type. The vast
majority of these sources are Class I and II types according to the Lada
classification. The distribution of AKARI FIS YSOs' is well correlated with
that of the galactic ISM. Local over densities were found on infrared loops and
towards the cold clumps detected by Planck.
