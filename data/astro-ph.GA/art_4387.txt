The local standard of rest and the well in the velocity distribution
It is now recognised that the traditional method of calculating the LSR
fails. We find an improved estimate of the LSR by making use of the larger and
more accurate database provided by XHIP and repeating our preferred analysis
from Francis & Anderson (2009a). We confirm an unexpected high value of $U_0$
by calculating the mean for stars with orbits sufficiently inclined to the
Galactic plane that they do not participate in bulk streaming motions. Our best
estimate of the solar motion with respect to the LSR $(U_0, V_0, W_0) = (14.1
\pm 1.1, 14.6 \pm 0.4, 6.9 \pm 0.1)$ km\ s$^{-1}$.
