The Top Ten Spitzer YSOs in 30 Doradus
The most luminous Spitzer point sources in the 30 Doradus triggered second
generation are investigated coherently in the 3-8 micron region. Remarkable
diversity and complexity in their natures are revealed. Some are also among the
brightest JHK sources, while others are not. Several of them are multiple when
examined at higher angular resolutions with HST NICMOS and WFPC2/WFC3 as
available, or with VISTA/VMC otherwise. One is a dusty compact H II region near
the far northwestern edge of the complex, containing a half dozen bright I-band
sources. Three others appear closely associated with luminous WN stars and
causal connections are suggested. Some are in the heads of dust pillars
oriented toward R136, as previously discussed from the NICMOS data. One resides
in a compact cluster of much fainter sources, while another appears monolithic
at the highest resolutions. Surprisingly, one is the brighter of the two
extended "mystery spots" associated with Knot 2 of Walborn et al. Masses are
derived from YSO models for unresolved sources and lie in the 10-30 M_{sun}
range. Further analysis of the IR sources in this unique region will advance
understanding of triggered massive star formation, perhaps in some unexpected
and unprecedented ways.
