Little Things
We present LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes,
The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey) that is aimed at determining what drives star
formation in dwarf galaxies. This is a multi-wavelength survey of 37 Dwarf
Irregular and 4 Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies that is centered around HI-line
data obtained with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large
Array (VLA). The HI-line data are characterized by high sensitivity (less than
1.1 mJy/beam per channel), high spectral resolution (less than or equal to 2.6
km/s), and high angular resolution (~6 arcseconds. The LITTLE THINGS sample
contains dwarf galaxies that are relatively nearby (less than or equal to 10.3
Mpc; 6 arcseconds is less than or equal to 300 pc), that were known to contain
atomic hydrogen, the fuel for star formation, and that cover a large range in
dwarf galactic properties. We describe our VLA data acquisition, calibration,
and mapping procedures, as well as HI map characteristics, and show channel
maps, moment maps, velocity-flux profiles, and surface gas density profiles. In
addition to the HI data we have GALEX UV and ground-based UBV and Halpha images
for most of the galaxies, and JHK images for some. Spitzer mid-IR images are
available for many of the galaxies as well. These data sets are available
on-line.
