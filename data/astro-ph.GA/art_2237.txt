Binary Star Disruption in Globular Clusters with Multiple Stellar
  Populations
The discovery of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters raises
fundamental questions concerning the formation and dynamical history of these
systems. In a previous study aimed at exploring the formation of
second-generation (SG) stars from the ejecta of first-generation (FG) AGB
stars, and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the cluster, we showed that SG
stars are expected to form in a dense subsystem concentrated in the inner
regions of the FG cluster. In this paper we explore the implications of the
structural properties of multiple-population clusters, and in particular the
presence of the inner SG subsystem, for the disruption of binary stars. We
quantify the enhancement of the binary disruption rate due to the presence of
the central SG subsystem for a number of different initial conditions. Our
calculations show that SG binaries, which are assumed to be more concentrated
in the cluster inner regions, are disrupted at a substantially larger rate than
FG binaries. Assuming a similar initial fraction of FG and SG binaries, our
dynamical study indicates that the SG population is now expected to contain a
significantly smaller binary fraction than the FG population.
