The structure of hot gas in Cepheus B
By observing radiation-affected gas in the Cepheus B molecular cloud we probe
whether the sequential star formation in this source is triggered by the
radiation from newly formed stars. We used the dual band receiver GREAT onboard
SOFIA to map [C II] and CO 13--12 and 11--10 in Cep B and compared the spatial
distribution and the spectral profiles with complementary ground-based data of
low-$J$ transitions of CO isotopes, atomic carbon, and the radio continuum. The
interaction of the radiation from the neighboring OB association creates a
large photon-dominated region (PDR) at the surface of the molecular cloud
traced through the photoevaporation of C^+. Bright internal PDRs of hot gas are
created around the embedded young stars, where we detect evidence of the
compression of material and local velocity changes; however, on the global
scale we find no indications that the dense molecular material is dynamically
affected.
