First Results for the Solar Neighborhood of the Asiago Red Clump Survey
The Asiago Red Clump Spectroscopic Survey (ARCS) is an ongoing survey that
provides atmospheric parameters, distances and space velocities of a well
selected sample of Red Clump stars distributed along the celestial equator. We
used the ARCS catalog for a preliminary investigation of the Galactic disk in
the Solar Neighborhood, in particular we focused on detection and
characterization of moving groups.
