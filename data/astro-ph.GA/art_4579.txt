Results on Panoramic Spectroscopy of MRK 171
Observations of Mrk 171, aimed at conduction of panoramic spectroscopy, were
undertaken with the Byurakan 2.6-m telescope using spectrograph VAGR. Within
the two components of the galaxy, there were differentiated eight condensations
of starforming activity, i.e. HII regions, and no sign of AGN activity was
revealed inspite of existing suggestions.
