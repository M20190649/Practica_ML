Scalar Field Dark Matter mass model and evolution of rotation curves for
  Lsb galaxies
We study the evolution of gas rotation curves within the scalar field dark
matter (SFDM) model. In this model the galactic haloes are astronomical
Bose-Einstein Condensate drops of scalar field. These haloes are characterized
by a constant-density core and are consistent with observed rotation curves of
dark matter dominated galaxies, a missing feature in CDM haloes resulting from
DM-only simulations. We add the baryonic component to the SFDM haloes and
simulate the evolution of the dark matter tracer in a set of grid-based
hydrodynamic simulations aimed to analyse the evolution of the rotation curves
and the gas density distribution in the case of dark matter dominated galaxies.
Previous works had found that when considering an exact analytic solution for a
static SF configuration, the free parameters of the model allows for good fits
to the rotation curves, we confirm that in our simulations but now taking into
account the evolution of the baryonic component in a static dark matter and
stellar disk potential. Including live gas is a step forward from the previous
work using SFDM, as for example, the rotation velocity of the gas is not always
exactly equal to the circular velocity of a test particle on a circular orbit.
Contrasting with the data the cored mass model presented here is preferred
instead of a cuspy one.
