Polarization sounding of pulsar magnetosphere
The possibility of a polarization sounding of the pulsar magnetosphere is
examined, using intrinsic pulsar emission as a probe signal, for modern radio
telescopes operating in the meter and decameter wavelength range. Different
models of the pulsar magnetosphere at altitudes higher than a radius of
critical polarization are used. The propagation medium besides magnetosphere is
described by the stratified model, in which each layer has its own density of
free electrons and vector of magnetic induction, as well as the spatial and
temporal fluctuation scales of these parameters.
  The frequency dependence of the polarization parameters of the pulsar radio
emission, obtained in the broad band for a selected pulse phase, will enable a
sounding deep into the pulsar magnetosphere.
