A Variable Star Census in a Perseus Field
The Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope is a small-aperture, wide-field
telescope dedicated to time-series photometric observations. During an initial
commissioning phase at the Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, Germany, and
subsequent operations at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France, a 3.1
{\deg} x 3.1 {\deg} circumpolar field close to the galactic plane centered at
({\alpha}, {\delta}) = (02h 39m 23s, +52{\deg} 01' 46") (J 2000.0) was observed
between 2001 August and 2006 December during 52 nights. From the 32129 stars
observed, a subsample of 145 stars with clear stellar variability was detected
out of which 125 are newly identified variable objects. For five bright
objects, the system parameters were derived by modeling the light curve.
