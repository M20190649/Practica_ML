Triggering, suppressing and redistributing star formation
We discuss three different ways in which stellar feedback may alter the
outcome of star cluster formation: triggering or suppressing star formation,
and redistributing the stellar population in space. We use detailed Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of HII regions in turbulent molecular
clouds to show that all three of these may happen in the same system, making
inferences about the effects of feedback problematic.
