Sampling methods for stellar masses and the mmax-Mecl relation in the
  starburst dwarf galaxy NGC 4214
It has been claimed in the recent literature that a non-trivial relation
between the mass of the most-massive star, mmax, in a star cluster and its
embedded star cluster mass (the mmax-Mecl relation) is falsified by
observations of the most-massive stars and the Halpha luminosity of young star
clusters in the starburst dwarf galaxy NGC 4214. Here it is shown by comparing
the NGC 4214 results with observations from the Milky Way that NGC 4214 agrees
very well with the predictions of the the mmax-Mecl relation and the integrated
galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) theory and that this difference
in conclusions is based on a high degree of degeneracy between expectations
from random sampling and those from the mmax-Mecl relation, but are also due to
interpreting mmax as a truncation mass in a randomly sampled IMF. Additional
analysis of galaxies with lower SFRs than those currently presented in the
literature will be required to break this degeneracy.
