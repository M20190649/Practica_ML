Detection of chloronium and measurement of the 35Cl/37Cl isotopic ratio
  at z=0.89 toward PKS1830-211
We report the first extragalactic detection of chloronium (H2Cl+), in the
z=0.89 absorber in front of the lensed blazar PKS1830-211. The ion is detected
through its 1_11-0_00 line along two independent lines of sight toward the
North-East and South-West images of the blazar. The relative abundance of H2Cl+
is significantly higher (by a factor ~7) in the NE line of sight, which has a
lower H2/H fraction, indicating that H2Cl+ preferably traces the diffuse gas
component. From the ratio of the H2^35Cl+ and H2^37Cl+ absorptions toward the
SW image, we measure a 35Cl/37Cl isotopic ratio of 3.1 (-0.2; +0.3) at z=0.89,
similar to that observed in the Galaxy and the solar system.
