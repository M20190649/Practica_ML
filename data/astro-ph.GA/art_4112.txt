The Red MSX Source Survey: the Massive Young Stellar Population of our
  Galaxy
We present the Red MSX Source (RMS) Survey, the largest statistically
selected catalog of young massive protostars and HII regions to date. We
outline the construction of the catalog using mid and near infrared color
selection, as well as the detailed follow up work at other wavelengths, and at
higher spatial resolution in the infrared. We show that within the adopted
selection bounds we are more than 90% complete for the massive protostellar
population, with a positional accuracy of the exciting source of better than 2
arcseconds. We briefly summarize some of the results that can be obtained from
studying the properties of the objects in the catalog as a whole, and find
evidence that the most massive stars form: (i) preferentially nearer the
Galactic centre than the anti-centre; (ii) in the most heavily reddened
environments, suggestive of high accretion rates; and (iii) from the most
massive cloud cores.
