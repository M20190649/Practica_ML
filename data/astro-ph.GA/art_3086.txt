HII Regions, Embedded Protostars, and Starless Cores in Sharpless 2-157
We present arcsecond resolution 1.4mm observations of the high mass star
forming region, Sharpless 2-157, that reveal the cool dust associated with the
first stages of star formation. These data are compared with archival images at
optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths, and complemented with new arcsecond
resolution mid-infrared data. We identify a dusty young HII region, numerous
infrared sources within the cluster envelope, and four starless condensations.
Three of the cores lie in a line to the south of the cluster peak, but the most
massive one is right at the center and associated with a jumble of bright radio
and infrared sources. This presents an interesting juxtaposition of high and
low mass star formation within the same cluster which we compare with similar
observations of other high mass star forming regions and discuss in the context
of cluster formation theory.
