Made-to-measure galaxy models - II Elliptical and Lenticular Galaxies
We take a sample of 24 elliptical and lenticular galaxies previously analysed
by the SAURON project using three-integral dynamical models created with
Schwarzschild's method, and re-analyse them using the made-to-measure (M2M)
method of dynamical modelling. We obtain good agreement between the two methods
in determining the dynamical mass-to-light (M/L) ratios for the galaxies with
over 80% of ratios differing by < 10% and over 95% differing by < 20%. We show
that (M/L)_M2M is approximately equal to (M/L)_Sch. For the global velocity
dispersion anisotropy parameter delta, we find similar values but with fewer of
the made-to-measure models tangentially anisotropic by comparison with their
SAURON Schwarzschild counterparts. Our investigation is the largest comparative
application of the made-to-measure method to date.
