The Invisible Monster Has Two Faces: Observations of Epsilon Aurigae
  with the Herschel Space Observatory
We present Herschel Space Observatory photometric observations of the unique,
long-period eclipsing binary star Epsilon Aurigae. Its extended spectral energy
distribution is consistent with our previously published cool (550 K) dust disk
model. We also present an archival infrared spectral energy distribution of the
side of the disk facing the bright F-type star in the binary, which is
consistent with a warmer (1150 K) disk model. The lack of strong molecular
emission features in the Herschel bands suggests that the disk has a low
gas-to-dust ratio. The spectral energy distribution and Herschel images imply
that the 250 GHz radio detection reported by Altenhoff et al. is likely
contaminated by infrared-bright, extended background emission associated with a
nearby nebular region and should be considered an upper limit to the true flux
density of Epsilon Aur.
