Galaxies behind the Galactic plane: First results and perspectives from
  the VVV Survey
Vista Variables in The Via Lactea (VVV) is an ESO variability survey that is
performing observations in near infrared bands (ZYJHKs) towards the Galactic
bulge and part of the disk with the completeness limits at least 3 mag deeper
than 2MASS. In the present work, we searched in the VVV survey data for
background galaxies near the Galactic plane using ZYJHKs photometry that covers
1.636 square degrees. We identified 204 new galaxy candidates by analyzing
colors, sizes, and visual inspection of multi-band (ZYJHKs) images. The galaxy
candidates colors were also compared with the predicted ones by star counts
models considering a more realistic extinction model at the same completeness
limits observed by VVV. A comparison of the galaxy candidates with the expected
one by Milennium simulations is also presented. Our results increase the number
density of known galaxies behind the Milky Way by more than one order of
magnitude. A catalog with galaxy properties including ellipticity, Petrosian
radii and ZYJHKs magnitudes is provided, as well as comparisons of the results
with other surveys of galaxies towards Galactic plane.
