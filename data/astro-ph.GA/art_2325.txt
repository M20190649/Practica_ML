Constraining Galactic Magnetic Field Models with Starlight Polarimetry
This paper provides testable predictions about starlight polarizations to
constrain the geometry of the Galactic magnetic field, in particular the nature
of the poloidal component. Galactic dynamo simulations and Galactic dust
distributions from the literature are combined with a Stokes radiative transfer
model to predict the observed polarizations and position angles of
near-infrared starlight, assuming the light is polarized by aligned anisotropic
dust grains. S0 and A0 magnetic field models and the role of magnetic pitch
angle are all examined. All-sky predictions are made, and particular directions
are identified as providing diagnostic power for discriminating among the
models. Cumulative distribution functions of the normalized degree of
polarization and plots of polarization position angle vs. Galactic latitude are
proposed as tools for testing models against observations.
