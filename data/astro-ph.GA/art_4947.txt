Hierarchical Star Formation in Nearby LEGUS Galaxies
Hierarchical structure in ultraviolet images of 12 late-type LEGUS galaxies
is studied by determining the numbers and fluxes of nested regions as a
function of size from ~1 to ~200 pc, and the number as a function of flux. Two
starburst dwarfs, NGC 1705 and NGC 5253, have steeper number-size and flux-size
distributions than the others, indicating high fractions of the projected areas
filled with star formation. Nine subregions in 7 galaxies have similarly steep
number-size slopes, even when the whole galaxies have shallower slopes. The
results suggest that hierarchically structured star-forming regions several
hundred parsecs or larger represent common unit structures. Small galaxies
dominated by only a few of these units tend to be starbursts. The
self-similarity of young stellar structures down to parsec scales suggests that
star clusters form in the densest parts of a turbulent medium that also forms
loose stellar groupings on larger scales. The presence of super star clusters
in two of our starburst dwarfs would follow from the observed structure if
cloud and stellar subregions more readily coalesce when self-gravity in the
unit cell contributes more to the total gravitational potential.
