Large-scale Interstellar Structure and the Heliosphere
The properties of interstellar clouds near the Sun are ordered by the Loop I
superbubble and by the interstellar radiation field. Comparisons of the
kinematics and magnetic field of the interstellar gas flowing past the Sun,
including the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), indicate a geometric relation
between Loop I as defined by radio synchrotron emission, and the interstellar
magnetic field that polarizes nearby starlight. Depletion of Fe and Mg onto
dust grains in the LIC shows a surprising relation to the far ultraviolet
interstellar radiation field that is best explained by a scenario for the LIC
to be extended, possibly filamentary, porous material drifting through space
with the Loop I superbubble. The interstellar velocity and magnetic field
measured by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) help anchor our
understanding of the physical properties of the nearby interstellar medium.
