Gravitational microlensing as a test of a finite-width disk model of the
  Galaxy
The aim of this work is to show, in the framework of a simple finite-width
disk model, that the amount of mass seen through gravitational microlensing
measurements in the region $0<R<R0$ is consistent with the dynamical mass
ascertained from Galaxy rotation after subtracting gas contribution. Since
microlensing only detects compact objects, this result suggests that a
non-baryonic mass component may be negligible in this region.
