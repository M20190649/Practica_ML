On the (in)variance of the dust-to-metals ratio in galaxies
Recent works have demonstrated a surprisingly small variation of the
dust-to-metals ratio in different environments and a correlation between dust
extinction and the density of stars. Naively, one would interpret these
findings as strong evidence of cosmic dust being produced mainly by stars. But
other observational evidence suggest there is a significant variation of the
dust-to-metals ratio with metallicity. As we demonstrate in this paper, a
simple star-dust scenario is problematic also in the sense that it requires
that destruction of dust in the interstellar medium (e.g., due to passage of
supernova shocks) must be highly inefficient. We suggest a model where stellar
dust production is indeed efficient, but where interstellar dust growth is
equally important and acts as a replenishment mechanism which can counteract
the effects of dust destruction. This model appears to resolve the seemingly
contradictive observations, given that the ratio of the effective (stellar)
dust and metal yields is not universal and thus may change from one environment
to another, depending on metallicity.
