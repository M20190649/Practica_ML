Structure and Evolution of the Milky Way
This review discusses the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, in the
context of opportunities provided by asteroseismology of red giants. The review
is structured according to the main Galactic components: the thin disk, thick
disk, stellar halo, and the Galactic bar/bulge. The review concludes with an
overview of Galactic archaeology and chemical tagging, and a brief account of
the upcoming HERMES survey with the AAT.
