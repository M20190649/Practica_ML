Two-Stream Instability as a Mechanism for Toroidal Magnetic Field
  Generation in the Magnetosphere of Crab Pulsar
New plasma mechanism for the generation of toroidal magnetic field in the
magnetosphere of Crab pulsar is presented. It is based on the development of
two-stream instability in the relativistic electron-positron plasma of the
pulsar magnetosphere. In particular, pulsar magnetosphere relativistic plasma
is penetrated by ultrarelativistic electron beam and two-stream instability
develops, as a result of which toroidal magnetic field is generated.
