The strange case of NGC2419: stellar populations, chemical composition,
  dynamics
A few years ago we started an observational campaign aimed at the thorough
study of the massive and remote globular cluster NGC2419. We have used the
collected data, e.g., to test alternative theories of gravitation, to constrain
the stellar M/L ratio by direct analysis of the observed luminosity function,
and to search for Dark Matter within the cluster. Here we present some recent
results about (a) the peculiar abundance pattern that we observed in a sample
of cluster giants, and (b) newly found photometric evidence for the presence of
multiple populations in the cluster. In particular, from new deep and accurate
uVI LBT photometry, we find that the color spread on the Red Giant Branch is
significantly larger than the observational errors both in V-I and u-V, and
that the stars lying to the blue of the RGB ridge line are more concentrated
toward the center of the cluster than those lying to the red of the ridge line.
