How Local is the Local Interstellar Magnetic Field?
Similar directions are obtained for the local interstellar magnetic field
(ISMF) by comparing diverse data and models that sample five orders of magnetic
in spatial scales. These data include the ribbon of energetic neutral atoms
discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer, heliosphere models, the
linear polarization of light from nearby stars, the Loop I ISMF, and pulsars
that are within 100--300 pc. Together these data suggest that the local ISMF
direction is correlated over scales of about 100 pc, such as would be expected
for the interarm region of the galaxy. The heliosphere tail-in excess of GeV
cosmic rays is consistent with the direction of the local ISMF direction found
from polarization data.
