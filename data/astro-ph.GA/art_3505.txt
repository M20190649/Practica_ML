Blind decomposition of Herschel-HIFI spectral maps of the NGC 7023
  nebula
Large spatial-spectral surveys are more and more common in astronomy. This
calls for the need of new methods to analyze such mega- to giga-pixel
data-cubes. In this paper we present a method to decompose such observations
into a limited and comprehensive set of components. The original data can then
be interpreted in terms of linear combinations of these components. The method
uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract latent spectral
end-members in the data. The number of needed end-members is estimated based on
the level of noise in the data. A Monte-Carlo scheme is adopted to estimate the
optimal end-members, and their standard deviations. Finally, the maps of linear
coefficients are reconstructed using non-negative least squares. We apply this
method to a set of hyperspectral data of the NGC 7023 nebula, obtained recently
with the HIFI instrument onboard the Herschel space observatory, and provide a
first interpretation of the results in terms of 3-dimensional dynamical
structure of the region.
