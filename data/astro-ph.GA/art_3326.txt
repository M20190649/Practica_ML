On the Excitation and Formation of Circumstellar Fullerenes
We compare and analyze the Spitzer mid-infrared spectrum of three
fullerene-rich planetary nebulae in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds;
Tc1, SMP SMC16, and SMP LMC56. The three planetary nebulae share many
spectroscopic similarities. The strongest circumstellar emission bands
correspond to the infrared active vibrational modes of the fullerene species
C60 and little or no emission is present from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
(PAHs). The strength of the fullerene bands in the three planetary nebulae is
very similar, while the ratio of the [NeIII]15.5um/[NeII]12.8um fine structure
lines, an indicator of the strength of the radiation field, is markedly
different. This raises questions about their excitation mechanism and we
compare the fullerene emission to fluorescent and thermal models. In addition,
the spectra show other interesting and common features, most notably in the
6-9um region, where a broad plateau with substructure dominates the emission.
These features have previously been associated with mixtures of
aromatic/aliphatic hydrocarbon solids. We hypothesize on the origin of this
band, which is likely related to the fullerene formation mechanism, and compare
it with modeled Hydrogenated Amorphous Carbon that present emission in this
region.
