Creation of Peanut-Shaped Bulges via the Slow Mode of Bar Growth
Recent theoretical work has implicated fast bar formation modes and
subsequent evolution as the creation mechanism for the observed peanut-shaped
bulges in some edge-on disk galaxies. We demonstrate an N-body simulation of a
disk undergoing a contrasting slow mode of bar growth, unsubjected to a
buckling instability, which nonetheless grows the 4:1 orbit family responsible
for a peanut-shaped bulge. We also present a simulation with fast mode bar
growth, which exhibits thickening similar to other work. A novel orbit
classification method that finds dynamically distinct families is presented,
allowing for a detailed analysis of angular momentum transfer channels within
the disk.
