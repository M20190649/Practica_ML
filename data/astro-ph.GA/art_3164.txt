Interstellar Dust Close to the Sun
The low density interstellar medium (ISM) close to the Sun and inside of the
heliosphere provides a unique laboratory for studying interstellar dust grains.
Grain characteristics in the nearby ISM are obtained from observations of
interstellar gas and dust inside of the heliosphere and the interstellar gas
towards nearby stars. Comparison between the gas composition and solar
abundances suggests that grains are dominated by olivines and possibly some
form of iron oxide. Measurements of the interstellar Ne/O ratio by the
Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft indicate that a high fraction of
interstellar oxygen in the ISM must be depleted onto dust grains. Local
interstellar abundances are consistent with grain destruction in ~150 km/s
interstellar shocks, provided that the carbonaceous component is hydrogenated
amorphous carbon and carbon abundances are correct. Variations in relative
abundances of refractories in gas suggest variations in the history of grain
destruction in nearby ISM. The large observed grains, > 1 micron, may indicate
a nearby reservoir of denser ISM. Theoretical three-dimensional models of the
interaction between interstellar dust grains and the solar wind predict that
plumes of about 0.18 micron dust grains form around the heliosphere.
