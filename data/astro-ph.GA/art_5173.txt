Two New Halo Debris Streams in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Using photometry from Data Release 10 of the northern footprint of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, we detect two new stellar streams with lengths of between
$25\arcdeg$ and $50\arcdeg$. The streams, which we designate Hermus and Hyllus,
are at distances of between 15 and 23 kpc from the Sun and pass primarily
through Hercules and Corona Borealis. Stars in the streams appear to be metal
poor, with [Fe/H] $\sim -2.3$, though we cannot rule out metallicities as high
as [Fe/H] = -1.2. While Hermus passes within $1\arcdeg$ (in projection) of the
globular cluster NGC 6229, a roughly one magnitude difference in distance
modulus, combined with no signs of connecting with NGC 6229's Roche lobe, argue
against any physical association between the two. Though the two streams almost
certainly had different progenitors, similarities in preliminary orbit
estimates suggest that those progenitors may themselves have been a product of
a single accretion event.
