Connection between dynamically derived IMF normalisation and stellar
  population parameters
We report on empirical trends between the dynamically determined stellar
initial mass function (IMF) and stellar population properties for a complete,
volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies from the Atlas3D project. We
study trends between our dynamically-derived IMF normalisation and absorption
line strengths, and interpret these via single stellar population- (SSP-)
equivalent ages, abundance ratios (measured as [alpha/Fe]), and total
metallicity, [Z/H]. We find that old and alpha-enhanced galaxies tend to have
on average heavier (Salpeter-like) mass normalisation of the IMF, but stellar
population does not appear to be a good predictor of the IMF, with a large
range of normalisation at a given population parameter. As a result, we find
weak IMF-[alpha/Fe] and IMF-age correlations, and no significant IMF-[Z/H]
correlation. The observed trends appear significantly weaker than those
reported in studies that measure the IMF normalisation via low-mass star
demographics inferred through stellar spectral analysis.
