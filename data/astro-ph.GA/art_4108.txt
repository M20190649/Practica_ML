Rotation Curve and Mass Distribution in the Galactic Center --- From
  Black Hole to Entire Galaxy ---
Analyzing high-resolution longitude-velocity (LV) diagrams of the Galactic
Center observed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope in the CO and CS line
emissions, we obtain a central rotation curve of the Milky Way. We combine it
with the data for the outer disk, and construct a logarithmic rotation curve of
the entire Galaxy. The new rotation curve covers a wide range of radius from r
~ 1 pc to several hundred kpc without a gap of data points. It links, for the
first time, the kinematical characteristics of the Galaxy from the central
black hole to the bulge, disk and dark halo. Using this grand rotation curve,
we calculate the radial distribution of surface mass density in the entire
Galaxy, where the radius and derived mass densities vary over a dynamical range
with several orders of magnitudes. We show that the galactic bulge is
deconvolved into two components: the inner (core) and main bulges. Both the two
bulge components are represented by exponential density profiles, but the de
Vaucouleurs law was found to fail in representing the mass profile of the
galactic bulge.
