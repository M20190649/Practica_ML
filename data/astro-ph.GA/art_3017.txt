The Milky Way Project: A statistical study of massive star formation
  associated with infrared bubbles
The Milky Way Project citizen science initiative recently increased the
number of known infrared bubbles in the inner Galactic plane by an order of
magnitude compared to previous studies. We present a detailed statistical
analysis of this dataset with the Red MSX Source catalog of massive young
stellar sources to investigate the association of these bubbles with massive
star formation. We particularly address the question of massive triggered star
formation near infrared bubbles. We find a strong positional correlation of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions with Milky Way Project
bubbles at separations of < 2 bubble radii. As bubble sizes increase, a
statistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the
region of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star
formation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources we find that
67+/-3% of MYSOs and (ultra)compact H II regions appear associated with a
bubble. We estimate that approximately 22+/-2% of massive young stars may have
formed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions. Using MYSO-bubble
correlations, we serendipitously recovered the location of the recently
discovered massive cluster Mercer 81, suggesting the potential of such analyses
for discovery of heavily extincted distant clusters.
