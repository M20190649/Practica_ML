The JCMT dense gas survey of the Perseus Molecular Cloud
We present the results of a large-scale survey of the very dense gas in the
Perseus molecular cloud using HCO+ and HCN (J = 4 - 3) transitions. We have
used this emission to trace the structure and kinematics of gas found in pre-
and protostellar cores, as well as in outflows. We compare the HCO+/HCN data,
highlighting regions where there is a marked discrepancy in the spectra of the
two emission lines. We use the HCO+ to identify positively protostellar
outflows and their driving sources, and present a statistical analysis of the
outflow properties that we derive from this tracer. We find that the relations
we calculate between the HCO+ outflow driving force and the Menv and Lbol of
the driving source are comparable to those obtained from similar outflow
analyses using 12CO, indicating that the two molecules give reliable estimates
of outflow properties. We also compare the HCO+ and the HCN in the outflows,
and find that the HCN traces only the most energetic outflows, the majority of
which are driven by young Class 0 sources. We analyse the abundances of HCN and
HCO+ in the particular case of the IRAS 2A outflows, and find that the HCN is
much more enhanced than the HCO+ in the outflow lobes. We suggest that this is
indicative of shock-enhancement of HCN along the length of the outflow; this
process is not so evident for HCO+, which is largely confined to the outflow
base.
