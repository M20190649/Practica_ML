The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. The Catalog of Stellar
  Proper Motions toward the Magellanic Clouds
We present a catalog of over 6.2 million stars with measured proper motions.
All these stars are observed in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds within
the brightness range 12 < I < 19 mag. Based on these proper motions about 440
000 Galactic foreground stars can be selected. Because the proper motions are
based on a few hundred epochs collected during eight years, their statistical
uncertainties are below 0.5 mas/yr for stars brighter than I = 18.5 mag. The
parallaxes are derived with uncertainties down to 1.6 mas. For above 13 000
objects parallaxes are derived with significance above 3\sigma, which allows
selecting around 270 white dwarfs (WDs). The search for common proper motion
binaries among stars presented was performed resulting in over 500 candidate
systems. The most interesting ones are candidate halo main sequence star-WD and
WD-WD systems. The application of the catalog to empirically bound the Cepheid
instability strip is also discussed.
