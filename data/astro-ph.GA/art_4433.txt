The Nuclear Cluster of the Milky Way: Total Mass and Luminosity
Here we present the fundamental properties of the nuclear cluster of the
Milky Way. First, we derive its structural properties by constructing a density
map of the central 1000'' using extinction-corrected star counts. We can
describe the data with a two-component model built from Sersic profiles. The
inner nearly spherical component is the nuclear cluster. The outer, strongly
flattened component can be identified with the stellar component of the
circumnuclear zone. Second, we enlarge the radius inside which detailed
dynamics are available from $1\,$pc to $4\,$pc. We use more than 10000
individual proper motions and more than 2700 radial velocities. We determine
the cluster mass by means of isotropic spherical Jeans modeling. We get a
nuclear cluster mass within 100'' of $M_{100''}=(6.11 \pm 0.52|_{\mathrm{fix}
R_0}\pm 0.97|_{R_0}) \times 10^6 $ M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a total
cluster mass of M$_{\mathrm{NC}}=(13.08 \pm 2.51|_{\mathrm{fix} R_0}\pm
2.08|_{R_0}) \times 10^6 $ M$_{\odot}$. By combination of our mass with the
flux we calculate $M/L=0.50 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot,\mathrm{Ks}}$ for the
central 100''. That is broadly consistent with a Chabrier IMF. With its mass
and a luminosity of M$_{\mathrm{Ks}}=-15.30\pm0.26$ the nuclear cluster is a
bright and massive specimen with a typical size.
