What's in a Fermi Bubble: a quasar episode in the Galactic centre
Fermi bubbles, the recently observed giant (~10 kpc high) gamma-ray emitting
lobes on either side of our Galaxy (Su et al. 2010), appear morphologically
connected to the Galactic center, and thus offer a chance to test several
models of supermassive black hole (SMBH) evolution, feedback and relation with
their host galaxies. We use a physical feedback model (King 2003, 2010) and
novel numerical techniques (Nayakshin et al. 2009) to simulate a short burst of
activity in Sgr A*, the central SMBH of the Milky Way, ~6 Myr ago, temporally
coincident with a star formation event in the central parsec. We are able to
reproduce the bubble morphology and energetics both analytically (Zubovas et
al. 2011) and numerically (Zubovas & Nayakshin, in prep). These results provide
strong support to the model, which was also used to simulate more extreme
environments (Nayakshin & Power 2010).
