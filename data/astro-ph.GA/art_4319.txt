Review of important reactions for the nitrogen chemistry in the
  interstellar medium
Predictions of astrochemical models depend strongly on the reaction rate
coefficients used in the simulations. We reviewed a number of key reactions for
the chemistry of nitrogen-bearing species in the dense interstellar medium and
proposed new reaction rate coefficients for those reactions. The details of the
reviews are given in the form of a datasheet associated with each reaction. The
new recommended rate coefficients are given with an uncertainty and a
temperature range of validity and will be included in KIDA
(http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr).
