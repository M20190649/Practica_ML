The Galactic thin and thick disk
The ongoing large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way such as SEGUE and
RAVE have enabled us to take a fresh look at the structure of the Galactic thin
and thick disks, and how their structure fits within the framework of structure
formation via hierarchical clustering. In this article I will summarize some
recent results mainly based in the RAVE survey with respect to the structure of
the Galactic disks, their possible origin as well as indications of
substructure and asymmetries.
