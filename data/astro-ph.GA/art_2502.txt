Polarisation of Class II Methanol Masers
We have used the University of Tasmania Mt Pleasant 26m radio telescope to
investigate the polarisation characteristics of a sample of strong 6.7 GHz
methanol masers, the first spectral line polarisation observations to be
undertaken with this instrument. As part of this process we have developed a
new technique for calibrating linear polarisation spectral line observations.
This calibration method gives results consistent with more traditional
techniques, but requires much less observing time on the telescope. We have
made the first polarisation measurements of a number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers
and find linear polarisation at levels of a few - 10% in most of the sources we
observed, consistent with previous results. We also investigated the circular
polarisation produced by Zeeman splitting in the 6.7 GHz methanol maser
G9.62+0.20 to get an estimate of the line of sight magnetic field strength of
35+/-7 mG.
