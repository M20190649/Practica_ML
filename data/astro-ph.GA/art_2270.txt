The Color-Magnitude Relation of Cluster Galaxies: Observations and Model
  Predictions
We investigate the origin of the color-magnitude relation (CMR) observed in
cluster galaxies by using a combination of cosmological N-body/SPH simulations
of galaxy clusters, and a semi-analaytic model of galaxy formation (Lagos, Cora
& Padilla 2008). Simulated results are compared with the photometric properties
of early-type galaxies in the Antlia cluster (Smith Castelli et al. 2008). The
good agreement obtained between observations and simulations allows us to use
the information provided by the model for unveiling the physical processes that
yield the tigh observed CMR.
