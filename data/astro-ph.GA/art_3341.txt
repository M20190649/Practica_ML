Helium line detections from ELDWIM at 1.4 GHz
Helium line observations towards 11 Galactic positions using Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope(WSRT) have been reported. These observations were
made towards nearby positions where already hydrogen lines were detected at
sufficiently high intensity($\geq$50mK) at 1.4 GHz. This approach gave a fair
chance for the detection of helium line as well, keeping in mind the relative
abundance(10%) of helium with respect to hydrogen. Care was also taken to avoid
the presence of HII regions along the line of sight so that the line emission
originates from the extended diffuse low density ionized component, ELDWIM of
the Galaxy. The observations have resulted in the detection of helium line
towards 5 positions out of 11 with signal to noise ratio(snr) $>$ 4$\sigma$. An
attempt has been made to associate detection/non-detection of helium line to
the presence of surrounding HII regions. A weighting scheme that accounts for
nearby($<$ 500pc) HII regions, their distances and other factors produces
favourable results. It is seen from this weighting scheme that a higher weight
favours the detection of helium line while lower weight is associated with
non-detection. The idea is to correlate ionization of ELDWIM with the
surrounding HII regions.
