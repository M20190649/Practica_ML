New detections of HC$_{5}$N toward hot cores associated with 6.7 GHz
  methanol masers
We present new detections of cyanodiacetylene (HC$_{5}$N) toward hot
molecular cores, observed with the Tidbinbilla 34 m radio telescope (DSS-34).
In a sample of 79 hot molecular cores, HC$_{5}$N was detected towards 35. These
results are counter to the expectation that long chain cyanopolyynes, such as
HC$_{5}$N, are not typically found in hot molecular cores, unlike their shorter
chain counterpart HC$_{3}$N. However it is consistent with recent models which
suggest HC$_{5}$N may exist for a limited period during the evolution of hot
molecular cores.
