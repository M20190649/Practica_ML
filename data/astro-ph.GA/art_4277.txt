Massive stars in massive clusters IV: Disruption of clouds by
  momentum-driven winds
We examine the effect of momentum-driven OB-star stellar winds on a parameter
space of simulated turbulent Giant Molecular Clouds using SPH hydrodynamical
simulations. By comparison with identical simulations in which ionizing
radiation was included instead of winds, we show that momentum-driven winds are
considerably less effective in disrupting their host clouds than are HII
regions. The wind bubbles produced are smaller and generally smoother than the
corresponding ionization-driven bubbles. Winds are roughly as effective in
destroying the very dense gas in which the O-stars are embedded, and thus
shutting down the main regions of star-forming activity in the model clouds.
However, their influence falls off rapidly with distance from the sources, so
they are not as good at sweeping up dense gas and triggering star formation
further out in the clouds. As a result, their effect on the star formation rate
and efficiency is generally more negative than that of ionization, if they
exert any effect at all.
