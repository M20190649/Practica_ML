SRAO CO Observation of 11 Supernova Remnants in l = 70 to 190 deg
We present the results of 12CO J = 1-0 line observations of eleven Galactic
supernova remnants (SNRs) obtained using the Seoul Radio Astronomy Observatory
(SRAO) 6-m radio telescope. The observation was made as a part of the SRAO CO
survey of SNRs between l = 70 and 190 deg, which is intended to identify SNRs
interacting with molecular clouds. The mapping areas for the individual SNRs
are determined to cover their full extent in the radio continuum. We used
halfbeam grid spacing (60") for 9 SNRs and full-beam grid spacing (120") for
the rest. We detected CO emission towards most of the remnants. In six SNRs,
molecular clouds showed a good spatial relation with their radio morphology,
although no direct evidence for the interaction was detected. Two SNRs are
particularly interesting: G85.4+0.7, where there is a filamentary molecular
cloud along the radio shell, and 3C434.1, where a large molecular cloud appears
to block the western half of the remnant. We briefly summarize the results
obtained for individual SNRs.
