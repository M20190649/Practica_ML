HH 114 MMS: a new chemically active outflow
Context. A small group of bipolar protostellar outflows display strong
emission from shock-tracer molecules such as SiO and CH3OH, and are generally
referred to as "chemically active." The best-studied outflow from this group is
the one in L 1157. Aims. We study the molecular emission from the bipolar
outflow powered by the very young stellar object HH 114 MMS and compare its
chemical composition with that of the L1157 outflow. Methods. We have used the
IRAM 30m radio telescope to observe a number of transitions from CO, SiO,
CH3OH, SO, CS, HCN, and HCO+ toward the HH 114 MMS outflow. The observations
consist of maps and a two-position molecular survey. Results. The HH 114 MMS
outflow presents strong emission from a number of shock-tracer molecules that
dominate the appearance of the maps around the central source. The abundance of
these molecules is comparable to the abundance in L 1157. Conclusions. The
outflow from HH 114 MMS is a spectacular new case of a chemically active
outflow.
