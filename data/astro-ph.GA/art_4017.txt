On column density thresholds and the star formation rate
We present the results of a numerical study designed to address the question
of whether there is a column density threshold for star formation within
molecular clouds. We have simulated a large number of different clouds, with
volume and column densities spanning a wide range of different values, using a
state-of-the-art model for the coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical
evolution of the gas. We show that star formation is only possible in regions
where the mean (area-averaged) column density exceeds $10^{21} \: {\rm
cm^{-2}}$. Within the clouds, we also show that there is a good correlation
between the mass of gas above a K-band extinction $A_{\rm K} = 0.8$ and the
star formation rate (SFR), in agreement with recent observational work.
Previously, this relationship has been explained in terms of a correlation
between the SFR and the mass in dense gas. However, we find that this
correlation is weaker and more time-dependent than that between the SFR and the
column density. In support of previous studies, we argue that dust shielding is
the key process: the true correlation is one between the SFR and the mass in
cold, well-shielded gas, and the latter correlates better with the column
density than the volume density.
