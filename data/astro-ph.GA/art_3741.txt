ATCA survey of water masers in the Large Magellanic Cloud
We have analysed archival data taken with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) during 2001--2003 and detected nine new interstellar and
circumstellar water masers in the LMC. This takes the total number of star
formation water masers in the LMC to 23, spread over 14 different star forming
regions and three evolved stars. Three water maser sources (N105a/MC23,
N113/MC24, N157a/MC74) have been detected in all the previous observations that
targeted these sites, although all show significant variability on timescales
of decades. The total number of independent water maser sources now known in
the LMC means that through very long baseline interferometry astrometric
measurements it will be possible to construct a more precise model of the
galactic rotation of the LMC and its orbital motion around the Milky Way
Galaxy.
