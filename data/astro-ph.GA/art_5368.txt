NGC 6522: A typical globular cluster in the Galactic bulge without
  signatures of rapidly rotating Population III stars
We present an abundance analysis of eight potential member stars of the old
Galactic bulge globular cluster NGC6522. The same stars have previously been
studied by Chiappini et al. (2011), who found very high abundances of the slow
neutron capture elements compared with other clusters and field stars of
similar metallicity, which they interpreted as reflecting nucleosynthesis in
rapidly rotating, massive Population III stars. In contrast to their analysis,
we do not find any unusual enhancements of the neutron capture elements Sr, Y,
Ba and Eu and conclude that previous claims result mainly from not properly
accounting for blending lines. Instead we find NGC6522 to be an unremarkable
globular cluster with comparable abundance trends to other Galactic globular
clusters at the same metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.15 +/- 0.16). The stars are also
chemically similar to halo and bulge field stars at the same metallicity,
spanning a small range in [Y/Ba] and with normal {\alpha}-element abundances.
We thus find no observational evidence for any chemical signatures of rapidly
rotating Population III stars in NGC 6522.
