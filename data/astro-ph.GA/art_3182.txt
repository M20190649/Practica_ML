Southern near-infrared photometric monitoring of Galactic young star
  clusters (NIP of Stars)
We have performed a near-infrared photometric monitoring of 39 galactic young
star clusters and star-forming regions, known as {\em NIP of Stars}, between
the years 2009--2011, using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory
(Chile) and the RetroCam camera. The primary objective of the campaign is to
perform a census of photometric variability of such clusters and to discover
massive eclipsing binary stars. In this work, we describe the general idea, the
implementation of the survey, and the first preliminary results of some of the
observed clusters. This monitoring program is complementary to the Vista
Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV), as the brightest sources observed in NIP
of Stars are saturated in VVV.
