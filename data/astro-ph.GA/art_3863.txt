Investigating Bar Structure of Disc Galaxies via PRIMAL: A
  PaRtIcle-by-particle M2M ALgorithm
We have modified our particle-by-particle adaptation of the made-to-measure
(M2M) method, with the aim of modelling the Galactic disc from upcoming
Galactic stellar survey data. In our new particle-by-particle M2M algorithm,
PRIMAL, the observables of the target system are compared with those of the
model galaxy at the position of the target stars, i.e. particles. The mass of
the model particles are adjusted to reproduce the observables of the target
system, and the gravitational potential is automatically adjusted by the
changing mass of the particles. This paper builds upon our previous work,
introducing likelihood-based velocity constraints in PRIMAL. In this paper we
apply PRIMAL to barred disc galaxies created by a N-body simulation in a known
dark matter potential, with no error in the observables. This paper
demonstrates that PRIMAL can recover the radial profiles of the surface
density, velocity dispersion in the radial and perpendicular directions, and
the rotational velocity of the target discs, along with the apparent bar
structure and pattern speed of the bar, especially when the reference frame is
adjusted so that the bar angle of the target galaxy is aligned to that of the
model galaxy at every timestep.
