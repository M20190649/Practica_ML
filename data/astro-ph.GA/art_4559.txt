High-resolution [C II] imaging of HDF850.1 reveals a merging galaxy at
  z=5.185
New high-resolution maps with the IRAM Interferometer of the redshifted [C
II] 158 micron line and the 0.98mm dust continuum of HDF850.1 at z = 5.185 show
the source to have a blueshifted northern component and a redshifted southern
component, with a projected separation of 0.3 arcsec, or 2 kpc. We interpret
these components as primordial galaxies that are merging to form a larger
galaxy. We think it is the resulting merger-driven starburst that makes
HDF850.1 an ultraluminous infrared galaxy, with an L(IR) of 1E13 Lsun. The
observed line and continuum brightness temperatures and the constant
line-to-continuum ratio across the source imply (1) high [C II] line optical
depth, (2) a [C II] excitation temperature of the same order as the dust
temperature, and (3) dust continuum emission that is nearly optically thick at
158 microns. These conclusions for HDF850.1 probably also apply to other
high-redshift submillimeter galaxies and quasar hosts in which the [C II] 158
micron line has been detected, as indicated by their roughly constant [C
II]-to-158 micron continuum ratios, in sharp contrast to the large dispersion
in their [C II]-to-FIR luminosity ratios. In brightness temperature units, the
[C II] line luminosity is about the same as the predicted CO(1-0) luminosity,
implying that the [C II] line can also be used to estimate the molecular gas
mass, with the same assumptions as for CO.
