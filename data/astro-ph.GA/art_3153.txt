Slicing The Monoceros Overdensity with Suprime-Cam
We derive distance, density and metallicity distribution of the stellar
Monoceros Overdensity (MO) in the outer Milky Way, based on deep imaging with
the Subaru Telescope. We applied CMD fitting techniques in three stripes at
galactic longitudes: l=130 deg, 150 deg, 170 deg; and galactic latitudes: +15 <
b [deg] < +25 . The MO appears as a wall of stars at a heliocentric distance of
~ 10.1\pm0.5 kpc across the observed longitude range with no distance change.
The MO stars are more metal rich ([Fe/H] ~ -1.0) than the nearby stars at the
same latitude. These data are used to test three different models for the
origin of the MO: a perturbed disc model, which predicts a significant drop in
density adjacent to the MO that is not seen; a basic flared disc model, which
can give a good match to the density profile but the MO metallicity implies the
disc is too metal rich to source the MO stars; and a tidal stream model, which
bracket the distances and densities we derive for the MO, suggesting that a
model can be found that would fully fit the MO data. Further data and modeling
will be required to confirm or rule out the MO feature as a stream or as a
flaring of the disc.
