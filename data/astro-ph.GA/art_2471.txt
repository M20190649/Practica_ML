Spectrum evolution in binary pulsar B1259-63/LS 2883 Be star and
  gigahertz-peaked spectra
We study the radio spectrum of PSR B1259-63 orbiting around the Be star LS
2883 and show that the shape of the spectrum depends on the orbital phase. At
frequencies below 3 GHz PSR B1259-63 flux densities are lower when measured
near the periastron passage than those measured far from periastron. We suggest
that an interaction of the radio waves with the Be star environment accounts
for this effect. While it is quite natural to explain the pulsar eclipse by the
presence of an equatorial disk around LS 2883, this disk alone cannot be
responsible for the observed spectral evolution of PSR B1259-63 and we,
therefore, propose a qualitative model which explains this evolution. We
consider two mechanisms that might influence the observed radio emission:
free-free absorption and cyclotron resonance. We believe that this binary
system can hold the clue to the understanding of gigahertz-peaked spectra of
pulsars.
