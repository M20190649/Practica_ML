A Detailed Spatiokinematic Model of the Conical Outflow of the
  Multipolar Planetary Nebula, NGC 7026
We present an extensive, long-slit, high-resolution coverage of the complex
planetary nebula (PN), NGC 7026. We acquired ten spectra using the Manchester
Echelle Spectrometer at San Pedro Martir Observatory in Baja California,
Mexico, and each shows exquisite detail, revealing the intricate structure of
this object. Incorporating these spectra into the 3-dimensional visualization
and kinematic program, SHAPE, and using HST images of NGC 7026, we have
produced a detailed structural and kinematic model of this PN. NGC 7026
exhibits remarkable symmetry consisting of three lobe-pairs and four sets of
knots, all symmetrical about the nucleus and displaying a conical outflow.
Comparing the 3-D structure of this nebula to recent, XMM-Newton X-ray
observations, we investigate the extended X-ray emission in relation to the
nebular structure. We find that the X-ray emission, while confined to the
closed, northern lobes of this PN, shows an abrupt termination in the middle of
the SE lobe, which our long slit data shows to be open. This is where the
shocked, fast wind seems to be escaping the interior of the nebula and the
X-ray emission rapidly cools in this region.
