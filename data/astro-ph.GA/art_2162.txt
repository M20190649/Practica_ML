The Star Clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud: Structural Parameters
We present and analyze the radial luminosity profiles of a sample of 1066
stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. By design, this study closely
follows the compilation by Hill & Zaritsky of the structural parameters of
stellar clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Both King and
Elson-Fall-Freeman (EFF) model profiles are fit to V-band surface brightness
profiles measured from the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey images. We
tabulate the concentration, central surface brightness, tidal radii, 90%
enclosed luminosity radii (r_{90}), and local background luminosity density.
Over two thirds of the clusters in the sample are adequately fit by one or both
of these models. One notable and systematic exception, as in the SMC, are those
clusters that lack a central brightness concentration, the "ring" clusters.
While the bulk properties of the clusters are similar between the LMC and SMC
populations, we find that the LMC lacks clusters that are as large, either in
terms of core radii or r_{90}, as the largest in the SMC, perhaps a signature
of larger tidal stresses in the LMC.
