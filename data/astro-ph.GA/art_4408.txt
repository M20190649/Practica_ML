Shock Excited Molecules in NGC 1266: ULIRG conditions at the center of a
  Bulge Dominated Galaxy
We investigate the far infrared spectrum of NGC 1266, a S0 galaxy that
contains a massive reservoir of highly excited molecular gas. Using the
SPIRE-FTS, we detect the $^{12}$CO ladder up to J=(13-12), [C I] and [N II]
lines, and also strong water lines more characteristic of UltraLuminous IR
Galaxies (ULIRGs). The 12CO line emission is modeled with a combination of a
low-velocity C-shock and a PDR. Shocks are required to produce the H2O and most
of the high-J 12CO emission. Despite having an infrared luminosity thirty times
less than a typical ULIRG, the spectral characteristics and physical conditions
of the ISM of NGC 1266 closely resemble those of ULIRGs, which often harbor
strong shocks and large-scale outflows.
