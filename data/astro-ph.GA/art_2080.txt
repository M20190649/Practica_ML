Astrometry of Galactic Star-Forming Region G48.61+0.02 with VERA
We performed the astrometry of H2O masers in the Galactic star-forming region
G48.61+0.02 with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA). We derived a
trigonometric parallax of 199+/-7 micro as, which corresponds to a distance of
5.03+/-0.19 kpc. The distance to G48.61+0.02 is about a half of its far
kinematic distance, which was often assumed previously. This distance places
G48.61+0.02 in the Sagittarius-Carina arm and near the active star forming
region and the supernova remnant W51. We also obtained the three dimensional
motion of G48.61+0.02, and found that it has a large peculiar motion of 40+/-5
km/s. This peculiar motion would be originated with the multiple supernovae
explosions in W51, or the streaming motion across the Sagittarius-Carina arm.
