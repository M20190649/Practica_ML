A Cold Milky Way Stellar Stream in the Direction of Triangulum
We present evidence for a new Milky Way stellar tidal stream in the direction
of the Andromeda and Triangulum (M31 and M33) galaxies. Using a matched-filter
technique, we search the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 by creating
stellar density maps which probe the Milky Way halo at distances between 8 and
40 kpc. A visual search of these maps recovers all of the major known stellar
streams, as well as a new stream in the direction of M31/M33 which we name the
Triangulum stream. The stream spans 0.2 deg by 12 deg on the sky, or 75 pc by
5.5 kpc in physical units with a best fitting distance of 26+/-4 kpc. The width
of the stream is consistent with being the tidal remnant of a globular cluster.
A color magnitude diagram of the stream region shows an overdensity which, if
identified as a main sequence turn-off, corresponds to an old (~12 Gyr) and
metal-poor ([Fe/H] \sim -1.0 dex) stellar population. Future kinematic studies
of this and similar cold streams will provide tight constraints on the shape of
the Galactic gravitational potential.
