The Influence of Orbital Eccentricity on Tidal Radii of Star Clusters
We have performed N-body simulations of star clusters orbiting in a
spherically symmetric smooth galactic potential. The model clusters cover a
range of initial half-mass radii and orbital eccentricities in order to test
the historical assumption that the tidal radius of a cluster is imposed at
perigalacticon. The traditional assumption for globular clusters is that since
the internal relaxation time is larger than its orbital period, the cluster is
tidally stripped at perigalacticon. Instead, our simulations show that a
cluster with an eccentric orbit does not need to fully relax in order to
expand. After a perigalactic pass, a cluster re-captures previously unbound
stars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing inner
region stars to larger orbits. Therefore, instead of the limiting radius being
imposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radius
of the cluster at any point in the orbit. We present a numerical correction
factor to theoretical tidal radii calculated at perigalacticon which takes into
consideration both the orbital eccentricity and current orbital phase of the
cluster.
