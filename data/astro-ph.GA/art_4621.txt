Gravitational anomalies signaling the breakdown of classical gravity
Recent observations for three types of astrophysical systems severely
challenge the GR plus dark matter scenario, showing a phenomenology which is
what modified gravity theories predict. Stellar kinematics in the outskirts of
globular clusters show the appearance of MOND type dynamics on crossing the
$a_{0}$ threshold. Analysis shows a ``Tully-Fisher'' relation in these systems,
a scaling of dispersion velocities with the fourth root of their masses.
Secondly, an anomaly has been found at the unexpected scales of wide binaries
in the solar neighbourhood. Binary orbital velocities cease to fall along
Keplerian expectations, and settle at a constant value, exactly on crossing the
$a_{0}$ threshold. Finally, the inferred infall velocity of the bullet cluster
is inconsistent with the standard cosmological scenario, where much smaller
limit encounter velocities appear. This stems from the escape velocity limit
present in standard gravity; the ``bullet'' should not hit the ``target'' at
more than the escape velocity of the joint system, as it very clearly did.
These results are consistent with extended gravity, but would require rather
contrived explanations under GR, each. Thus, observations now put us in a
situation where modifications to gravity at low acceleration scales cease to be
a matter of choice, to now become inevitable.
