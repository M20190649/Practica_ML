Tracing a relativistic Milky Way within the RAMOD measurement protocol
Advancement in astronomical observations and technical instrumentation
implies taking into account the general relativistic effects due the
gravitational fields encountered by the light while propagating from the star
to the observer. Therefore, data exploitation for Gaia-like space astrometric
mission (ESA, launch 2013) requires a fully relativistic interpretation of the
inverse ray-tracing problem, namely the development of a highly accurate
astrometric models in accordance with the geometrical environment affecting
light propagation itself and the precepts of the theory of measurement. This
could open a new rendition of the stellar distances and proper motions, or even
an alternative detection perspective of many subtle relativistic effects
suffered by light while it is propagating and subsequently recorded in the
physical measurements.
