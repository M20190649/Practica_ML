Sagittarius stream 3-d kinematics from SDSS Stripe 82
Using multi-epoch observations of the Stripe 82 region done by Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, we measure precise statistical proper motions of the stars in the
Sagittarius stellar stream. The multi-band photometry and SDSS radial
velocities allow us to efficiently select Sgr members and thus enhance the
proper motion precision to ~0.1 mas/yr. We measure separately the proper motion
of a photometrically selected sample of the main sequence turn-off stars, as
well as of a spectroscopically selected Sgr giants. The data allow us to
determine the proper motion separately for the two Sgr streams in the South
found in Koposov et al.(2012). Together with the precise velocities from SDSS,
our proper motion provide exquisite constraints of the 3-D motions of the stars
in the Sgr streams.
