SOAR Adaptive Optics Observations of the Globular Cluster NGC6496
We present high-quality BVRI photometric data in the field of globular
cluster NGC 6496 obtained with the SOAR Telescope Adaptive Module (SAM). Our
observations were collected as part of the ongoing SAM commissioning. The
distance modulus and cluster color excess as found from the red clump is $\mMv
= 15.71 \pm 0.02$\,mag and $\EVI = 0.28 \pm 0.02$\,mag. An age of $10.5 \pm
0.5$\,Gyr is determined from the difference in magnitude between the red clump
and the subgiant branch. These parameters are in excellent agreement with the
values derived from isochrone fitting. From the color-magnitude diagram we find
a metallicity of $\feh = -0.65$\,dex and hence support a disk classification
for NGC 6496. The complete $BVRI$ data set for NGC 6469 is made available in
the electronic edition of the Journal.
