Star formation history, double degenerates and type Ia supernovae in the
  thin disc
We investigate the relation between the star formation history and the
evolution of the double-degenerate (DD) population in the thin disc of the
Galaxy, which we assume to have formed 10 Gyr before the present. We introduce
the use of star-formation contribution functions as a device for evaluating the
birth rates, total number and merger rates of DDs. These contribution functions
help to demonstrate the relation between star-formation history and the current
DD population and, in particular, show how the numbers of different types of DD
are sensitive to different epochs of star formation.
  We have compared the impact of different star-formation models on the rates
and numbers of DDs and on the rates of type Ia (SNIa) and core-collapse
supernovae (ccSN). In addition to a quasi-exponential decline model, we
considered an instantaneous (or initial starburst) model, a constant-rate
model, and an enhanced-rate model. All were normalised to produce the present
observed star density in the local thin disc. The evolution of the rates and
numbers of both DDs and SNIa are different in all four models, but are most
markedly different in the instantaneous star-formation model, which produces a
much higher rate than the other three models in the past, primarily as a
consequence of the normalisation.
  Predictions of the current SNIa rate range from ~2 to 5\times10^{-4} yr^{-1}
in the four models, and are slightly below the observed rate because we only
consider the DD merger channel. The predicted ccSN rate ranges from 1.5 to 3
century^{-1}, and is consistent with observations.
