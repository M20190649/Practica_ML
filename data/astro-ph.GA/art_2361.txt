Determining the Age of Young Embedded Clusters
A new Monte Carlo method has been developed in order to derive ages of young
embedded clusters within massive star forming regions where there is strong
differential reddening. After foreground and infrared excess source candidates
are removed, each cluster candidate star is individually dereddened. Simulated
clusters are constructed using isochrones, an IMF, realistic photometric
errors, simulated background field populations and extinction distributions.
These synthetic clusters are then dereddened in the same way as the real data,
obtained from a deep near infrared survey, and used to derive the ages of 3
embedded clusters. Results were found to be consistent with those determined
using spectrophotometric methods. This new method provides way to determine the
ages of embedded clusters when only photometric data are available and there is
strong differential reddening.
