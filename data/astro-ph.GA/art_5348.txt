Multi-epoch VLBA observations of radio galaxy 0932+075: is this a
  compact symmetric object?
A part of the radio structure of the galaxy 0932+075 emerged as a possible
compact symmetric object (CSO) after the observation with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz in 1997. More than a decade later, we carried
out observations at 5, 15.4, and 22.2 GHz using the VLBA to test this
possibility. We report here that we have found a component whose spectrum is
inverted in the whole range from 5 GHz to 22 GHz and we label it a
high-frequency peaker (HFP). Using a set of 5 GHz images from two epochs
separated by 11.8 years and a set of 15.4 GHz images separated by 8.2 years, we
were able to examine the proper motions of the three components of the CSO
candidate with respect to the HFP. We found that their displacements cannot be
reconciled with the CSO paradigm. This has led to the rejection of the
hypothesis that the western part of the arcsecond-scale radio structure of
0932+075 is a CSO anchored at the HFP. Consequently, the HFP cannot be labelled
a core and its role in this system is unclear.
