Calibrated Estimates of the Energy in Major Flares of GRS 1915+105
We analyze the energetics of the major radio flare of October 8 2005 in GRS
1915+105. The flare is of particular interest because it is one of the most
luminous and energetic radio flares from a Galactic black hole that has ever
been observed. The motivation is two-fold. One, to learn more about the
energetics of this most extreme phenomenon and its relationship to the
accretion state. The second is to verify if the calibrated estimates of the
energy of major radio flares (based on the peak low frequency optically thin
flux) derived from flares in the period 1996-2001 in Punsly & Rodriguez (2013),
PR13 hereafter, can be used to estimate plasmoid energy beyond this time
period. We find evidence that the calibrated curves are still accurate for this
strong flare. Furthermore, the physically important findings of PR13 are
supported by the inclusion of this flare: the flare energy is correlated with
both the intrinsic bolometric X-ray luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$, $\sim 1$
hour before ejection and $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ averaged over the duration of the
ejection of the plasmoid and $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is highly elevated relative to
historic levels just before and during the ejection episode. A search of the
data archives reveal that only the October 8 2005 flare and those in PR13 have
adequate data sampling to allow estimates of both the energy of the flare and
the X-ray luminosity before and during flare launch.
