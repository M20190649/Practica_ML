Verifying the mass-metallicity relation in damped Lyman-alpha selected
  galaxies at 0.1<z<3.2
A scaling relation has recently been suggested to combine the galaxy
mass-metallicity (MZ) relation with metallicities of damped Lyman-alpha systems
(DLAs) in quasar spectra. Based on this relation the stellar masses of the
absorbing galaxies can be predicted. We test this prediction by measuring the
stellar masses of 12 galaxies in confirmed DLA absorber - galaxy pairs in the
redshift range 0.1<z<3.2. We find an excellent agreement between the predicted
and measured stellar masses over three orders of magnitude, and we determine
the average offset $\langle C_{[M/H]} \rangle$ = 0.44+/-0.10 between absorption
and emission metallicities. We further test if $C_{[M/H]}$ could depend on the
impact parameter and find a correlation at the 5.5sigma level. The impact
parameter dependence of the metallicity corresponds to an average metallicity
difference of -0.022+/-0.004 dex/kpc. By including this metallicity vs. impact
parameter correlation in the prescription instead of $C_{[M/H]}$, the scatter
reduces to 0.39 dex in log M*. We provide a prescription how to calculate the
stellar mass (M*,DLA) of the galaxy when both the DLA metallicity and DLA
galaxy impact parameter is known. We demonstrate that DLA galaxies follow the
MZ relation for luminosity-selected galaxies at z=0.7 and z=2.2 when we include
a correction for the correlation between impact parameter and metallicity.
