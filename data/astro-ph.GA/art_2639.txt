Kinematic groups across the MW disc: insights from models and from the
  RAVE catalogue
With the advent of the Gaia data, the unprecedented kinematic census of great
part of the Milky Way disc will allow us to characterise the local kinematic
groups and new groups in different disc neighbourhoods. First, we show here
that the models predict a stellar kinematic response to the spiral arms and bar
strongly dependent on disc position. For example, we find that the kinematic
groups induced by the spiral arm models change significantly if one moves only
~ 0.6 kpc in galactocentric radius, but ~ 2 kpc in azimuth. There are more and
stronger groups as one approaches the spiral arms. Depending on the spiral
pattern speed, the kinematic imprints are more intense in nearby vicinities or
far from the Sun. Secondly, we present a preliminary study of the kinematic
groups observed by RAVE. This sample will allow us, for the first time, to
study the dependence on Galactic position of the (thin and thick) disc moving
groups. In the solar neighbourhood, we find the same kinematics groups as
detected in previous surveys, but now with better statistics and over a larger
spatial volume around the Sun. This indicates that these structures are indeed
large scale kinematic features.
