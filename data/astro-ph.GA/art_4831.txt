The distribution of interstellar dust in CALIFA edge-on galaxies via
  oligochromatic radiative transfer fitting
We investigate the amount and spatial distribution of interstellar dust in
edge-on spiral galaxies, using detailed radiative transfer modeling of a
homogeneous sample of 12 galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey. Our
automated fitting routine, FitSKIRT, was first validated against artificial
data. This is done by simultaneously reproducing the SDSS $g$-, $r$-, $i$- and
$z$-band observations of a toy model in order to combine the information
present in the different bands. We show that this combined, oligochromatic
fitting, has clear advantages over standard monochromatic fitting especially
regarding constraints on the dust properties. We model all galaxies in our
sample using a three-component model, consisting of a double exponential disc
to describe the stellar and dust discs and using a S\'ersic profile to describe
the central bulge. The full model contains 19 free parameters, and we are able
to constrain all these parameters to a satisfactory level of accuracy without
human intervention or strong boundary conditions. Apart from two galaxies, the
entire sample can be accurately reproduced by our model. We find that the dust
disc is about 75% more extended but only half as high as the stellar disc. The
average face-on optical depth in the V-band is $0.76$ and the spread of $0.60$
within our sample is quite substantial, which indicates that some spiral
galaxies are relatively opaque even when seen face-on.
