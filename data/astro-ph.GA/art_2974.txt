Dynamics and PDR properties in IC1396A
We investigate the gas dynamics and the physical properties of
photodissociation regions (PDRs) in IC1396A, which is an illuminated
bright-rimmed globule with internal structures created by young stellar
objects. Our mapping observations of the [CII] emission in IC1396A with GREAT
onboard SOFIA revealed the detailed velocity structure of this region. We
combined them with observations of the [CI] 3P_1 - 3P_0 and CO(4-3) emissions
to study the dynamics of the different tracers and physical properties of the
PDRs. The [CII] emission generally matches the IRAC 8 micron, which traces the
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions. The CO(4-3) emission peaks
inside the globule, and the [CI] emission is strong in outer regions, following
the 8 micron emission to some degree, but its peak is different from that of
[CII]. The [CII] emitting gas shows a clear velocity gradient within the
globule, which is not significant in the [CI] and CO(4-3) emission. Some clumps
that are prominent in [CII] emission appear to be blown away from the rim of
the globule. The observed ratios of [CII]/[CI] and [CII]/CO(4-3) are compared
to the KOSMA-tau PDR model, which indicates a density of 10^4-10^5 cm-3.
