SMBH in Galactic Nuclei with Tidal Disruption of Stars
Tidal Disruption of stars by super massive central black holes from dense
star clusters is modeled by high-accuracy direct $N$-body simulation. The time
evolution of the stellar tidal disruption rate, the effect of tidal disruption
on the stellar density profile and for the first time the detailed origin of
tidally disrupted stars are carefully examined and compared with classic papers
in the field. Up to 128k particles are used in simulation to model the star
cluster around the super massive black hole, we use the particle number and the
tidal radius of black hole as free parameters for a scaling analysis. The
transition from full to empty loss-cone is analyzed in our data, the tidal
disruption rate scales with the particle number $N$ in the expected way for
both cases. For the first time in numerical simulations (under certain
conditions) we can support the concept of a critical radius of Frank & Rees
(1976), which claims that most stars are tidally accreted on highly eccentric
orbits originating from regions far outside the tidal radius. Due to the
consumption of stars moving on radial orbits, a velocity anisotropy is founded
inside the cluster. Finally we make an estimation for the real galactic center
based on our simulation results and the scaling analysis.
