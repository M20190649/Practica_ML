Kinematics of nearby OB3 stars with interstellar CaII line distances
We tested the distances derived from the equivalent widths of interstellar
CaII spectral lines by Megier et al. 2009. To this end, we used a sample of
nearby 126 young OB3 stars ($r<1$ kpc) with known proper motions and
line-of-site velocities. It is shown that these stars are tightly bounded with
the Gould Belt structure. Most part of this sample (about 100 stars) show the
same kinematics as the sample of distant OB3 stars. Their galactocentric radial
velocities are in good agreement with the following spiral density wave
parameters: amplitude of radial perturbations $f_R\approx$12 km/s, wavelength
$\lambda\approx2.3$ kpc and phase of the Sun in spiral wave
$\chi_\odot\approx-90^\circ$. But we revealed 20 stars with absolutely unusual
kinematical features. Their galactocentric radial velocities show a wave,
biased on $\approx180^\circ$ with respect to the wave, found from the whole
sample. The idea of superposition of two spiral patterns seems to be probable.
