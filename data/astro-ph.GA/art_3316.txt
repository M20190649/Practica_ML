12.2-GHz methanol maser MMB follow-up catalogue - II. Longitude range
  186 to 330 degrees
We present the second portion of a catalogue of 12.2-GHz methanol masers
detected towards 6.7-GHz methanol masers observed in the unbiased Methanol
Multibeam (MMB) Survey. Using the Parkes radio telescope we have targeted all
207 6.7-GHz methanol masers in the longitude range 186 to 330 degrees for
12.2-GHz counterparts. We report the detection of 83 12.2-GHz methanol masers,
and one additional source which we suspect is thermal emission, equating to a
detection rate of 40 per cent. Of the 83 maser detections, 39 are reported here
for the first time. We discuss source properties, including variability and
highlight a number of unusual sources. We present a list of 45 candidates that
are likely to harbor methanol masers in the 107.0-GHz transition.
