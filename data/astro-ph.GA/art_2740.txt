Identification of Spitzer-IRS staring mode targets in the Magellanic
  Clouds
The SAGE-LMC, SAGE-SMC and HERITAGE surveys have mapped the Magellanic Clouds
in the infrared using the Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes. Over 8.5
million point sources were detected and catalogued in the LMC alone. Staring
mode observations using the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) on board Spitzer have
been obtained for 1,000 positions in the LMC and ~250 in the SMC. From the
infrared spectroscopy we have identified the nature of the sources for which
spectroscopy is available. These IRS staring mode targets represent an
important contribution to the SED of these dwarf galaxies. Here we report on
our latest results.
