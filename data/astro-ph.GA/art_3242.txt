Revealing The Millimeter Environment of the New FU Orionis Candidate
  HBC722 with the Submillimeter Array
We present 230 GHz Submillimeter Array continuum and molecular line
observations of the newly discovered FUor candidate HBC722. We report the
detection of seven 1.3 mm continuum sources in the vicinity of HBC722, none of
which correspond to HBC722 itself. We compile infrared and submillimeter
continuum photometry of each source from previous studies and conclude that
three are Class 0 embedded protostars, one is a Class I embedded protostar, one
is a Class I/II transition object, and two are either starless cores or very
young, very low luminosity protostars or first hydrostatic cores. We detect a
northwest-southeast outflow, consistent with the previous detection of such an
outflow in low-resolution, single-dish observations, and note that its axis may
be precessing. We show that this outflow is centered on and driven by one of
the nearby Class 0 sources rather than HBC722, and find no conclusive evidence
that HBC722 itself is driving an outflow. The non-detection of HBC722 in the
1.3 mm continuum observations suggests an upper limit of 0.02 solar masses for
the mass of the circumstellar disk. This limit is consistent with typical T
Tauri disks and with a disk that provides sufficient mass to power the burst.
