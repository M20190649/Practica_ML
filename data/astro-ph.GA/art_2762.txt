Light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool Eta Carinae during its
  19th-century Great Eruption
Eta Carinae (Eta Car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the Milky
Way. It became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century
"Great Eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates of
brightness). Its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in that
it exceeded the Eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. Because it is only 2.3
kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejected
mass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, Eta Car
ejected more than 10 M_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of a
typical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. Here we report the
discovery of light echoes of Eta Carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858
Great Eruption. Spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, which
are blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansion
speeds. The light-echo spectra correlate best with those of G2-G5 supergiant
spectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 K. In contrast to the class
of extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of Eta Car's Great Eruption,
the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowed
by standard opaque wind models. This indicates that other physical mechanisms
like an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.
