Dynamical models and Galaxy surveys
Equilibrium dynamical models are essential tools for extracting science from
surveys of our Galaxy. We show how models can be tested with data from a survey
before the survey's selection function has been determined. We illustrate the
application of this method by presenting some results for the RAVE survey. We
extend our published analytic distribution functions to include chemistry and
fit the chosen functional form to a combination of the Geneva--Copenhagen
survey (GCS) and a sample of G-dwarfs observed at z~1.75 kpc by the SEGUE
survey. By including solid dynamics we are able to predict the contribution
that the thick disc/halo stars surveyed by SEGUE should make to the GCS survey.
We show that the measured [Fe/H] distribution from the GCS includes many fewer
stars at [Fe/H]<-0.6 than are predicted. The problem is more likely to lie in
discordant abundance scales than with incorrect dynamics.
