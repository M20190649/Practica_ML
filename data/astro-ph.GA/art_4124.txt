A STIS Atlas of CaII Triplet Absorption Line Kinematics in Galactic
  Nuclei
The relations observed between supermassive black holes and their host
galaxies suggest a fundamental link in the processes that cause these two
objects to evolve. A more comprehensive understanding of these relations could
be gained by increasing the number of supermassive black hole mass (M)
measurements. This can be achieved, in part, by continuing to model the stellar
dynamics at the centers of galactic bulges using data of the highest possible
spatial resolution. Consequently, we present here an atlas of galaxies in the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data archive that may have spectra
suitable for new M estimates. Archived STIS G750M data for all non-barred
galactic bulges are co-aligned and combined, where appropriate, and the radial
signal-to-noise ratios calculated. The line-of-sight velocity distributions
from the CaII triplet are then determined using a maximum penalized likelihood
method. We find 19 out of 42 galaxies may provide useful new M estimates since
they are found to have data that is comparable in quality with data that has
been used in the past to estimate M. However, we find no relation between the
signal-to-noise ratio in the previously analyzed spectra and the uncertainties
of the black hole masses derived from the spectra. We also find that there is a
very limited number of appropriately observed stellar templates in the archive
from which to estimate the effects of template mismatching.
