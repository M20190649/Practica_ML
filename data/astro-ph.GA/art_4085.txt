The Neutron Star Born in the Antlia Supernova Remnant
Among all known young nearby neutron stars, we search for the neutron star
that was born in the same supernova event that formed the Antlia supernova
remnant (SNR). We also look for a runaway star that could have been the former
companion to the neutron star (if it exists) and then got ejected due to the
same supernova. We find the pulsar PSR J0630-2834 to be the best candidate for
a common origin with the Antlia SNR. In that scenario the SNR is ~1.2 Myr old
and is presently located at a distance of ~138 pc. We consider the runaway star
HIP 47155 a former companion candidate to PSR J0630-2834. The encounter time
and place is consistent with both stars being ejected from the Antlia SNR. We
measured the radial velocity of HIP 47155 as 32.42 +/- 0.70km/s.
