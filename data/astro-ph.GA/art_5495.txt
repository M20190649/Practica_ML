20 cm VLA Radio-Continuum Study of M31 - Images and Point Source
  Catalogues DR2: Extraction of a supernova remnant sample
We present Data Release 2 of the Point Source Catalogue created from a series
of previously constructed radio-continuum images of M31 at lambda=20 cm (nu=1.4
GHz) from archived VLA observations. In total, we identify a collection of 916
unique discrete radio sources across the field of M31. Comparing these detected
sources to those listed by Gelfand et al. (2004) at lambda=92 cm, the spectral
index of 98 sources has been derived. The majority (73%) of these sources
exhibit a spectral index of alpha <-0.6, indicating that their emission is
predominantly non-thermal in nature, which is typical for background objects
and Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Additionally, we investigate the presence of
radio counterparts for some 156 SNRs and SNR candidates, finding a total of
only 13 of these object in our images within a 5 arcsec search area. Auxiliary
optical, radio and X-ray catalogs were cross referenced highlighting a small
population of SNR and SNR candidates common to multi-frequency domains.
