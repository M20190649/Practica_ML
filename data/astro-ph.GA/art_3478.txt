Obscured clusters.IV. The most massive stars in [DBS2003]179
Aims. We report new results for the massive evolved and main sequence members
of the young galactic cluster DBS2003 179. We determine the physical parameters
and investigate the high-mass stellar content of the cluster, as well as of its
close vicinity. Methods. Our analysis is based on ISAAC/VLT moderate-resolution
(R\approx4000) infrared spectroscopy of the brightest cluster members. We
derive stellar parameters for sixteen of the stellar members, using full
non-LTE modeling of the obtained spectra. Results. The cluster contains three
late WN or WR/LBV stars (Obj 4, Obj 15, and Obj 20:MDM32) and at least 5 OIf
and 5 OV stars. According to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for DBS2003 179,
the WR stars show masses above 85Msun, the OIf stars are between 40 and 80Msun,
and the main sequence O stars are >20Msun. There are indications of binarity
for Obj 4 and Obj 11, and Obj 3 shows a variable spectrum. The cluster is
surrounded by a continuous protostar formation region most probably triggered
by DBS2003 179. Conclusions. We confirm that DBS2003 179 is young massive
cluster (2.5 10^4Msun) very close to the Galactic center at the distance of
7.9+-0.8 kpc.
