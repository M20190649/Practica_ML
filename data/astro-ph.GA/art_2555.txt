The Wendelstein Calar Alto Pixellensing Project (WeCAPP): the M31 Nova
  catalogue
We present light curves from the novae detected in the long-term, M31
monitoring WeCAPP project. The goal of WeCAPP is to constrain the compact dark
matter fraction of the M31 halo with microlensing observations. As a by product
we have detected 91 novae benefiting from the high cadence and highly sensitive
difference imaging technique required for pixellensing. We thus can now present
the largest CCD and optical filters based nova light curve sample up-to-date
towards M31. We also obtained thorough coverage of the light curve before and
after the eruption thanks to the long-term monitoring. We apply the nova
taxonomy proposed by Strope et al. (2010) to our nova candidates and found 29
S-class novae, 10 C-class novae, 2 O-class novae and 1 J-class nova. We have
investigated the universal decline law advocated by Hachichu and Kato (2006) on
the S-class novae. In addition, we correlated our catalogue with the literature
and found 4 potential recurrent novae. Part of our catalogue has been used to
search for optical counter-parts of the super soft X-ray sources detected in
M31 (Pietsch et al. 2005). Optical surveys like WeCAPP, and coordinated with
multi-wavelength observation, will continue to shed light on the underlying
physical mechanism of novae in the future.
