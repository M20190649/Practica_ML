Class I methanol masers in low-mass star formation regions
Four Class I maser sources were detected at 44, 84, and 95 GHz toward
chemically rich outflows in the regions of low-mass star formation NGC 1333I4A,
NGC 1333I2A, HH25, and L1157. One more maser was found at 36 GHz toward a
similar outflow, NGC 2023. Flux densities of the newly detected masers are no
more than 18 Jy, being much lower than those of strong masers in regions of
high-mass star formation. The brightness temperatures of the strongest peaks in
NGC 1333I4A, HH25, and L1157 at 44 GHz are higher than 2000 K, whereas that of
the peak in NGC 1333I2A is only 176 K. However, rotational diagram analysis
showed that the latter source is also a maser. The main properties of the newly
detected masers are similar to those of Class I methanol masers in regions of
massive star formation. The former masers are likely to be an extension of the
latter maser population toward low luminosities of both the masers and the
corresponding YSOs.
