Dynamical evolution of a bulge in an N-body model of the Milky Way
The detailed dynamical structure of the bulge in the Milky Way is currently
under debate. Although kinematics of the bulge stars can be well reproduced by
a boxy-bulge, the possible existence of a small embedded classical bulge can
not be ruled out. We study the dynamical evolution of a small classical bulge
in a model of the Milky Way using a self-consistent high resolution N-body
simulation. Detailed kinematics and dynamical properties of such a bulge are
presented.
