Low-Resolution Spectrum of the Diffuse Galactic Light and 3.3 um PAH
  emission with AKARI InfraRed Camera
We first obtained the spectrum of the diffuse Galactic light (DGL) at general
interstellar space in 1.8-5.3 um wavelength region with the low-resolution
prism spectroscopy mode of the AKARI Infra-Red Camera (IRC) NIR channel. The
3.3 um PAH band is detected in the DGL spectrum at Galactic latitude |b| < 15
deg, and its correlations with the Galactic dust and gas are confirmed. The
correlation between the 3.3 um PAH band and the thermal emission from the
Galactic dust is expressed not by a simple linear correlation but by a relation
with extinction. Using this correlation, the spectral shape of DGL at optically
thin region (5 deg < |b| < 15 deg) was derived as a template spectrum. Assuming
that the spectral shape of this template spectrum is uniform at any position,
DGL spectrum can be estimated by scaling this template spectrum using the
correlation between the 3.3 um PAH band and the thermal emission from the
Galactic dust.
