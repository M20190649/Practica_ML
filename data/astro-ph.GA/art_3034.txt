GREAT confirms transient nature of the circumnuclear disk
We report SOFIA/GREAT, Herschel/HIFI, and ground-based velocity-resolved
spectroscopy of carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions from J=2-1 to
J=16-15 toward two positions in the circum-nuclear disk (CND) in our Galactic
center. Radiative transfer models were used to derive information on the
physical state of the gas traced by CO. The excitation of the CO gas cannot be
explained by a single physical component, but is clearly the superposition of
various warm gas phases. In a two-component approach, our large velocity
gradient (LVG) analysis suggests high temperatures of ~200 K with moderate gas
densities of only ~10^4.5 cm^-3 for the bulk of the material. A higher excited
phase, carrying ~20-30% of the column densities, is warmer (~300-500 K) but
only slightly denser ~10^5.3 cm^-3. These densities are too low to
self-stabilize the clumps against their high internal turbulence and fall below
the Roche density (>10^7 cm^-3) at 1.5 pc galactocentric distance. We conclude
that the bulk of the material in the CND is not organized by self-gravity nor
stable against tidal disruption, and must be transient.
