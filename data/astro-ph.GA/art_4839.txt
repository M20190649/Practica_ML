Probing obscured, high redshift galaxies using deep P-band continuum
  imaging with GMRT
We have carried out a deep (150 micro Jy rms) P-band, continuum imaging
survey of about 40 square degrees of sky in the XMM-LSS, Lockman Hole and
ELAIS-N1 fields with the GMRT. Our deep radio data, combined with deep archival
observations in the X-ray (XMM/Chandra), optical (SDSS, CFHTLS), near-infrared
(UKIDSS, VISTA/VIDEO), mid-infrared (Spitzer/SWIRE, Spitzer/SERVS) and
far-infrared (Spitzer/SWIRE, Herschel/HerMES) will enable us to obtain an
accurate census of star-forming and active galaxies out to z~2. This
panchromatic coverage enables accurate determination of photometric redshifts
and accurate modeling of the spectral energy distribution. We are using our
large, merged photometric catalog of over 10000 galaxies to pursue a number of
science goals.
