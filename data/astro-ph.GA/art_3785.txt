Gravitationally lensed extended sources: the case of QSO RXJ0911
After a brief reminder of the mechanism of gravitational lensing of extended
sources, the particular case of the host galaxy of QSO RXJ0911, a high redshift
(z~2.8) quadruply imaged quasar, is explored. The non linearity of the problem,
together with the proximity of the source to a cusp of the lens inner caustic,
have important consequences on the dependence of the image appearance on the
size and shape of the source. Their expected main features and their
interpretation in terms of source extension and shape are investigated in a
spirit of simplicity and in preparation for the analysis of high sensitivity
and spatial resolution images that will soon be within reach with the
completion of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In
particular, the information on source size carried by relative image brightness
is discussed. Extension of the results to other types of quadruply imaged
quasars is briefly considered.
