The Curious Conundrum Regarding Sulfur Abundances In Planetary Nebulae
Sulfur abundances derived from optical emission line measurements and
ionization correction factors in planetary nebulae are systematically lower
than expected for the objects' metallicities. We have carefully considered a
large range of explanations for this "sulfur anomaly", including: (1)
correlations between the size of the sulfur deficit and numerous nebular and
central star properties; (2) ionization correction factors which under-correct
for unobserved ions; (3) effects of dielectronic recombination on the sulfur
ionization balance; (4) sequestering of S into dust and/or molecules; and (5)
excessive destruction of S or production of O by AGB stars. It appears that all
but the second scenario can be ruled out. However, we find evidence that the
sulfur deficit is generally reduced but not eliminated when S^+3 abundances
determined directly from IR measurements are used in place of the customary
sulfur ionization correction factor. We tentatively conclude that the sulfur
anomaly is caused by the inability of commonly used ICFs to properly correct
for populations of ionization stages higher than S^+2.
