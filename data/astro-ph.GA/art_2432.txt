Kinematics of Red Variables in the Solar Neighborhood I. Basic Data
  Obtained by an SiO Maser Survey
In order to study the streaming motions of miras in the Solar neighborhood,
we newly surveyed 379 red variables in the SiO maser lines at 42.821 and 43.122
GHz with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. Accurate radial velocities were
obtained for 229 (220 new) detected stars. The sample is selected from optical
variables found by new automated surveys: the Northern Sky Variability Survey
and the All Sky Automated Survey. The new sample consists of the "bluer"
objects compared with those observed in the previous SiO surveys. The distances
to the objects are estimated using the period-luminosity relation, and they are
mostly less than 3 kpc from the Sun. The longitude-velocity diagram reveals
three prominent groups of stars deviant from the circular Galactic rotation
with a flat rotation curve. In addition to the Hercules group of stars which
was studied before, we found two new deviant groups: one toward the Perseus arm
and the other toward the Sagittarius arm. These two groups both exhibit
anomalous motions toward the Galactic center, which seem to be consistent with
the noncircular motions of these spiral arms found in the recent VLBI
proper-motion measurements for maser gas clumps.
