The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment: First
  Detection of High Velocity Milky Way Bar Stars
Commissioning observations with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III, have
produced radial velocities (RVs) for ~4700 K/M-giant stars in the Milky Way
bulge. These high-resolution (R \sim 22,500), high-S/N (>100 per resolution
element), near-infrared (1.51-1.70 um; NIR) spectra provide accurate RVs
(epsilon_v~0.2 km/s) for the sample of stars in 18 Galactic bulge fields
spanning -1<l<20 deg, |b|<20 deg, and dec>-32 deg. This represents the largest
NIR high-resolution spectroscopic sample of giant stars ever assembled in this
region of the Galaxy. A cold (sigma_v~30 km/s), high-velocity peak (V_GSR \sim
+200 km/s) is found to comprise a significant fraction (~10%) of stars in many
of these fields. These high RVs have not been detected in previous MW surveys
and are not expected for a simple, circularly rotating disk. Preliminary
distance estimates rule out an origin from the background Sagittarius tidal
stream or a new stream in the MW disk. Comparison to various Galactic models
suggests that these high RVs are best explained by stars in orbits of the
Galactic bar potential, although some observational features remain
unexplained.
