Dark Matter Massive Fermions and Einasto Profiles in Galactic Haloes
On the basis of a fermionic dark matter model we fit rotation curves of The
HI Nearby Galaxy Survey THINGS sample and compare our 3-parametric model to
other models widely used in the literature: 2-parametric Navarro--Frenk--White,
pseudoisothermal sphere, Burkhert models, and 3-parametric Einasto model,
suggested as the new "standard dark matter profile" model in the paper by
Chemin et. al., AJ 142 (2011) 109. The results from the fitting procedure
provides evidence for an underlying fermionic nature of the dark matter
candidate, with rest mass above the keV regime.
