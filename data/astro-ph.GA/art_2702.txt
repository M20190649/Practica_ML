The Carina Flare: What can fragments in the wall tell us?
$^{13}$CO(J=2--1) and C$^{18}$O(J=2--1) observations of the molecular cloud
G285.90+4.53 (Cloud~16) in the Carina Flare supershell (GSH287+04-17) with the
APEX telescope are presented. With an algorithm DENDROFIND we identify 51
fragments and compute their sizes and masses. We discuss their mass spectrum
and interpret it as being the result of the shell fragmentation process
described by the pressure assisted gravitational instability - PAGI. We
conclude that the explanation of the clump mass function needs a combination of
gravity with pressure external to the shell.
