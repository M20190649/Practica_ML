12.2-GHz methanol maser MMB follow-up catalogue - I. Longitude range 330
  to 10 degrees
We present a catalogue of 12.2-GHz methanol masers detected towards 6.7-GHz
methanol masers observed in the unbiased Methanol Multibeam (MMB) survey in the
longitude range 330\circ (through 360\circ) to 10\circ. This is the first
portion of the catalogue which, when complete, will encompass all of the MMB
detections. We report the detection of 184 12.2-GHz sources towards 400 6.7-GHz
methanol maser targets, equating to a detection rate of 46 per cent. Of the 184
12.2-GHz detections, 117 are reported here for the first time. We draw
attention to a number of 'special' sources, particularly those with emission at
12.2-GHz stronger than their 6.7-GHz counterpart and conclude that these
unusual sources are not associated with a specific evolutionary stage.
