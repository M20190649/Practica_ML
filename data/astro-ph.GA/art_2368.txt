Two generations in stellar complexes and associations in M 33 galaxy and
  their spatial correlation
Massive stellar content of stellar complexes and associations in M 33 is
studied combining deep UBV photometry from the Local Group Survey (Massey et
al. 2006) and JHK photometry from the 2MASS. Two basic populations (incl. OB
stars and red supergiants) are distinguished and their application for
reconstruction of the star formation process in this galaxy are discussed.
