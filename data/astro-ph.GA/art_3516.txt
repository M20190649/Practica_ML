Origin of pulsar pulse fine structure
We give a new numerical model of pulsar pulse radiation through the
interstellar medium (ISM) considering the propagation effects. It explains the
deficit of a scattering measure at the decameter range of frequencies that
leads to the possibility of detecting the pulsar pulse fine structure. The
results of numerical simulation confirm that the fine structure may be detected
at low frequencies and this is qualitatively agreed with the observational
data.
