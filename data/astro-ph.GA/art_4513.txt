A Radio Survey of Galactic Center Clouds
We present a survey of molecules in a sample of Galactic center molecular
clouds using the Karl G. Jansky Very large Array, which includes M0.25+0.01,
the clouds near Sgr A, and Sgr B2. The molecules detected are primarily NH3 and
HC3N; in Sgr B2-N we also detect nonmetastable NH3, vibrationally-excited HC3N,
torsionally-excited CH3OH, and numerous isotopologues of these species. 36 GHz
Class I CH3OH masers are ubiquitous in these fields, and in several cases are
associated with new NH3 (3,3) maser candidates. We also find that NH3 and HC3N
are depleted or absent toward several of the highest dust column density peaks
identified in submillimeter observations, which are associated with water
masers and are thus likely in the early stages of star formation.
