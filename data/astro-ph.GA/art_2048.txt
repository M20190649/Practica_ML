Observations and radiative transfer modelling of a massive dense cold
  core in G333
Cold massive cores are one of the earliest manifestations of high mass star
formation. Following the detection of SiO emission from G333.125-0.562, a cold
massive core, further investigations of the physics, chemistry and dynamics of
this object has been carried out. Mopra and NANTEN2 molecular line profile
observations, Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) line and continuum
emission maps, and Spitzer 24 and 70 \mum images were obtained. These new data
further constrain the properties of this prime example of the very early stages
of high mass star formation. A model for the source was constructed and
compared directly with the molecular line data using a 3D molecular line
transfer code - MOLLIE. The ATCA data reveal that G333.125-0.562 is composed of
two sources. One of the sources is responsible for the previously detected
molecular outflow and is detected in the Spitzer 24 and 70 \mum band data.
Turbulent velocity widths are lower than other more active regions of G333
which reflects the younger evolutionary stage and/or lower mass of this core.
The molecular line modelling requires abundances of the CO isotopes that
strongly imply heavy depletion due to freeze-out of this species onto dust
grains. The principal cloud is cold, moderately turbulent and possesses an
outflow which indicates the presence of a central driving source. The secondary
source could be an even less evolved object as no apparent associations with
continuum emissions at (far-)infrared wavelengths.
