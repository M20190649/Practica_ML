Efficiency tests for estimating the gas and stellar population
  parameters in Type 2 objects
We investigated the efficiency of estimating characteristics of stellar
populations (SP) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission using ULySS code. To
analyse simultaneously AGN and SP components in the integrated spectrum of Type
2 active galaxies, we modelled the featureless continuum (FC) and emission
lines, and we used PEGASE.HR stellar population models provided by ULySS. In
order to validate the method, we simulated over 7000 integrated spectra of
Seyfert 2 galaxies. Spectra were generated using different characteristics of
the featureless AGN continuum, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral ranges,
properties of emission lines and single stellar population (SSP) model whose
initial mass function (IMF) and abundance pattern is similar to the solar
neighbourhood. Simulated spectra were fitted with ULySS to evaluate the ability
of the method to extract SP and AGN properties. We found that the analysis with
ULySS can efficiently restore the characteristics of SP in spectra of Seyfert 2
AGNs, where signal-to-noise ratio is higher than 20, and where SP contributes
with more than 10% to the total flux. Degeneracies between AGN and SP
parameters increase with increasing the AGN continuum fraction, which points
out the importance of simultaneous fitting of the FC and SP contributions.
