Accretion History of the Milky Way Dark Matter Halo and the Origin of
  its Angular Momentum
The flow of dark matter into the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud in a
model for the gravitational field of the neighboring galaxies yields a growth
history for the dark matter halo of the Milky Way that ends up with angular
momentum roughly in the observed direction, and it produces a dark matter
stream around the Large Magellanic Cloud that resembles the Magellanic Stream.
