AGN torus properties with WISE
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has scanned the entire sky
with unprecedented sensitivity in four infrared bands, at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22
micron. The WISE Point Source Catalog contains more than 560 million objects,
among them hundreds of thousands of galaxies with Active Nuclei (AGN). While
type 1 AGN, owing to their bright and unobscured nature, are easy to detect and
constitute a rather complete and unbiased sample, their type 2 counterparts,
postulated by AGN unification, are not as straightforward to identify. Matching
the WISE catalog with known QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we confirm
previous identification of the type 1 locus in the WISE color space. Using a
very large database of the popular CLUMPY torus models, we find the colors of
the putative type 2 counterparts, and also, for the first time, predict their
number vs. flux relation that can be expected to be observed in any given WISE
color range. This will allow us to put statistically very significant
constraints on the torus parameters. Our results are a successful test of the
AGN unification scheme.
