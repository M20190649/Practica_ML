H2O maser motions and the distance of the star forming region
  G192.16-3.84
We present the results of astrometic observations of H2O masers associated
with the star forming region G192.16-3.84 with the VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry (VERA). The H2O masers seem to be associated with two young stellar
objects (YSOs) separated by \sim1200 AU as reported in previous observations.
In the present observations, we successfully detected an annual parallax of
0.66 \pm 0.04 mas for the H2 O masers, which corresponds to a distance to
G192.16-3.84 of D = 1.52 \pm 0.08 kpc from the Sun. The determined distance is
shorter than the estimated kinematic distance. Using the annual parallax
distance and the estimated parameters of the millimeter continuum emission, we
estimate the mass of the disk plus circumstellar cloud in the southern young
stellar object to be 10.0+4.3M\cdot. We also estimate the galactocentric
distance and the peculiar motion -3.6 of G192.16-3.84, relative to a circular
Galactic rotation: R\star = 9.99 \pm 0.08 kpc, Z\star = -0.10 \pm 0.01 kpc, and
(U\star,V\star,W\star)=(-2.8\pm1.0,-10.5\pm0.3,4.9\pm2.7)[kms-1]respectively.
The peculiar motion of G192.16-3.84 is within that typically found in recent
VLBI astrometric results. The angular distribution and three-dimensional
velocity field of H2O maser features associated with the northern YSO indicate
the existence of a bipolar outflow with a major axis along the
northeast-southwest direction.
