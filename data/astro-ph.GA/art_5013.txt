100 deg$^2$ Mock Galaxy Cone for HI Surveys with the Early SKA
We distribute an easy-to-use mock catalog of galaxies with detailed neutral
atomic hydrogen (HI) and auxiliary molecular and optical properties. The
catalog covers a field of 10-by-10 degrees and a redshift range of z=0-1.2. It
contains galaxies with 21cm peak flux densities down to 1uJy and is, within
this flux limit, complete for HI masses above 10^8 solar masses. Five random
realisations of the catalog in ASCII format (~4GB/file) and subtables with HI
flux limits of 10u Jy (~500MB/file) and 100uJy$ (~30MB/file) can be downloaded
at http://ict.icrar.org/store/staff/do/s3sax.
