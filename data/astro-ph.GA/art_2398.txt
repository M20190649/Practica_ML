GM 2-4 - a signpost for low and intermediate mass star formation
We present a multi-wavelength study of the region towards the GM 2-4 nebula
and the nearby source IRAS 05373+2340. Our near-infrared H2 1-0 S(1) line
observations reveal various shock-excited features which are part of several
bipolar outflows. We identify candidates for the driving sources of the
outflows from a comparison of the multi-waveband archival data-sets and SED
modelling. The SED spectral slope (\alpha(IRAC)) for all the protostars in the
field was then compared with the visual extinction map. This comparison
suggests that star formation is progressing from NE to SW across this region.
