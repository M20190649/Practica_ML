A New Perspective on the Radio Active Zone at The Galactic Center -
  Feedback from Nuclear Activities
Based on our deep image of Sgr A using broadband data observed with the
Jansky VLA at 6 cm, we present a new perspective of the radio bright zone at
the Galactic center. We further show the radio detection of the X-ray
Cannonball, a candidate neutron star associated with the Galactic center SNR
Sgr A East. The radio image is compared with the Chandra X-ray image to show
the detailed structure of the radio counterparts of the bipolar X-ray lobes.
The bipolar lobes are likely produced by the winds from the activities within
Sgr A West, which could be collimated by the inertia of gas in the CND, or by
the momentum driving of Sgr A*; and the poloidal magnetic fields likely play an
important role in the collimation. The less-collimated SE lobe, in comparison
to the NW one, is perhaps due to the fact that the Sgr A East SN might have
locally reconfigured the magnetic field toward negative galactic latitudes. In
agreement with the X-ray observations, the time-scale of ~ $1\times10^4$ yr
estimated for the outermost radio ring appears to be comparable to the inferred
age of the Sgr A East SNR.
