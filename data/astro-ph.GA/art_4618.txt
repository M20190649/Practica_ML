First results from the CALYPSO IRAM-PdBI survey. I. Kinematics of the
  inner envelope of NGC1333-IRAS2A
The structure and kinematics of Class 0 protostars on scales of a few hundred
AU is poorly known. Recent observations have revealed the presence of Keplerian
disks with a diameter of 150-180 AU in L1527-IRS and VLA1623A, but it is not
clear if such disks are common in Class 0 protostars. Here we present
high-angular-resolution observations of two methanol lines in NGC1333-IRAS2A.
We argue that these lines probe the inner envelope, and we use them to study
the kinematics of this region. Our observations suggest the presence of a
marginal velocity gradient normal to the direction of the outflow. However, the
position velocity diagrams along the gradient direction appear inconsistent
with a Keplerian disk. Instead, we suggest that the emission originates from
the infalling and perhaps slowly rotating envelope, around a central protostar
of 0.1-0.2 M$_\odot$. If a disk is present, it is smaller than the disk of
L1527-IRS, perhaps suggesting that NGC1333-IRAS2A is younger.
