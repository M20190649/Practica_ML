Atomic jet from SMM1 (FIRS1) in Serpens uncovers non-coeval binary
  companion
We report on the detection of an atomic jet associated with the protostellar
source SMM1 (FIRS1) in Serpens. The jet is revealed in [FeII] and [NeII] line
maps observed with Spitzer/IRS, and further confirmed in HiRes IRAC and MIPS
images. It is traced very close to SMM1 and peaks at ~5 arcsec" from the source
at a position angle of $\sim 125 degrees. In contrast, molecular hydrogen
emission becomes prominent at distances > 5" from the protostar and extends at
a position angle of 160 degrees. The morphological differences suggest that the
atomic emission arises from a companion source, lying in the foreground of the
envelope surrounding the embedded protostar SMM1. In addition the molecular and
atomic Spitzer maps disentangle the large scale CO (3-2) emission observed in
the region into two distinct bipolar outflows, giving further support to a
proto-binary source setup. Analysis at the peaks of the [FeII] jet show that
emission arises from warm and dense gas (T ~1000 K, n(electron) 10^5 - 10^6
cm^-3). The mass flux of the jet derived independently for the [FeII] and
[NeII] lines is 10^7 M(sun)/yr, pointing to a more evolved Class~I/II protostar
as the driving source. All existing evidence converge to the conclusion that
SMM1 is a non-coeval proto-binary source.
