NGC 6302: high-ionization permitted lines. Applying X-SSN synthesis to
  VLT-UVES spectra
A preliminary VLT-UVES spectrum of NGC 6302 (Casassus et al. 2002, MN), which
hosts one of the hottest PN nuclei known (Teff ~ 220000 K; Wright et al. 2011,
MN), has been recently analysed by means of X-SSN, a spectrum synthesis code
for nebulae (Morisset and P\'equignot). Permitted recombination lines from
highly-ionized species are detected/identified for the first time in a PN, and
some of them probably for the first time in (Astro)Physics. The need for a
homogeneous, high signal-to-noise UVES spectrum for NGC 6302 is advocated.
