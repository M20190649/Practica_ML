Narrow-line Seyfert Galaxies. Connection between abundance and the
  large-scale structure
In this work the correlations between spatial concentrations of active nuclei
(NLS and BLS) and concentration of galaxies of full uniform sample were
obtained. Methods, developed by the author in earlier paper were used. Galaxies
of this uniform sample trace the large-scale structure. We used SDSS DR 7 data.
The correlations obtained are linear and the NLS/BLS ratio is constant. That
leads to conclusion that amounts NLS and BLS are some fixed fraction of all
galaxies independent on the density of large-scale environment. In order to
check validity of our results were also confirmed the well known result that
fraction of red galaxies increases with density of environment. Also it was
confirmed that this trend is more prominent for less massive galaxies.
