Comparative studies of Population Synthesis Models in the frame work of
  modified Str√∂mgren filters
Evolutionary models form a vital part of stellar population research to
understand their evolution, but despite their long history of development, they
often misrepresent and misinterpret the properties of stellar population
observed through broadband and spectroscopic measurements. With the growing
numbers of these synthesis models, model comparison becomes an important
analysis to choose a suitable model for upgrade. Along with the model
comparison, we reinvestigate the technique of modified Str\"omgren photometry
to measure reliable parameter-sensitive colours and estimate precise model ages
and metallicities. The assessment of Rakos/Schulz models with GALEV and
Worthey's Lick/IDS model find smaller colour variation: \Delta(uz-vz) $\leq$
0.056, \Delta(bz-yz) $\leq$ -0.05 and \Delta(vz-yz) $\leq$ 0.061. The study
conveys a good agreement of GALEV models with the modified Str\"omgren colours
but with poor UV model predictions with the observed globular cluster data,
while the spectroscopic models perform badly due to the use of older isochrone
and stellar spectral libraries with inaccurate/insufficient knowledge of
various stellar phases and their treatment. Overall, the assessment finds
modified Str\"omgren photometry well suited to study different types stellar
populations by mitigating the effects of the age-metallicity degeneracy.
