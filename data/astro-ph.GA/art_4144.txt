Putting the Diffuse Interstellar Bands on the map - literally!
In a quest to further our understanding of the diffuse interstellar medium
(ISM) as well as the unidentified carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands
(DIBs), we are mapping DIBs across the sky using hundreds of hot stars as
background torches - globular clusters (in particular omega Centauri), nearby
stars in and around the Local Bubble, and stars within the Magellanic Clouds. I
describe the results so far obtained and our current experiments.
