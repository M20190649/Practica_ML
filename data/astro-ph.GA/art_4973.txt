Herschel Extreme Lensing Line Observations: Dynamics of two strongly
  lensed star forming galaxies near redshift z = 2
We report on two regularly rotating galaxies at redshift z=2, using high
resolution spectra of the bright [CII] 158 micron emission line from the HIFI
instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory. Both SDSS090122.37+181432.3
("S0901") and SDSS J120602.09+514229.5 ("the Clone") are strongly lensed and
show the double-horned line profile that is typical of rotating gas disks.
Using a parametric disk model to fit the emission line profiles, we find that
S0901 has a rotation speed v sin(i) = 120 +/- 7 km/s and gas velocity
dispersion sigma < 23 km/s. The best fitting model for the Clone is a
rotationally supported disk having v sin(i) = 79 +/- 11 km/s and sigma < 4km/s.
However the Clone is also consistent with a family of dispersion-dominated
models having sigma = 92 +/- 20 km/s. Our results showcase the potential of the
[CII] line as a kinematic probe of high redshift galaxy dynamics: [CII] is
bright; accessible to heterodyne receivers with exquisite velocity resolution;
and traces dense star-forming interstellar gas. Future [CII] line observations
with ALMA would offer the further advantage of spatial resolution, allowing a
clearer separation between rotation and velocity dispersion.
