Constraints on free-free emission from Anomalous Microwave Emission
  Sources in the Perseus Molecular Cloud
We present observations performed with the Green Bank Telescope at 1.4 and 5
GHz of three strips coincident with the anomalous microwave emission features
previously identified in the Perseus molecular cloud at 33 GHz with the Very
Small Array. With these observations we determine the level of the low
frequency (~1 - 5 GHz) emission. We do not detect any significant extended
emission in these regions and we compute conservative 3\sigma upper limits on
the fraction of free-free emission at 33 GHz of 27%, 12%, and 18% for the three
strips, indicating that the level of the emission at 1.4 and 5 GHz cannot
account for the emission observed at 33 GHz. Additionally, we find that the low
frequency emission is not spatially correlated with the emission observed at 33
GHz. These results indicate that the emission observed in the Perseus molecular
cloud at 33 GHz, is indeed in excess over the low frequency emission, hence
confirming its anomalous nature.
