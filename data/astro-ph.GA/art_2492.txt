The curious conundrum regarding sulfur and oxygen abundances in
  planetary nebulae
We carefully consider numerous explanations for the sulfur abundance anomaly
in planetary nebulae. No one rationale appears to be satisfactory, and we
suggest that the ultimate explanation is likely to be a heretofore unidentified
feature of the nebular gas which significantly impacts the sulfur ionization
correction factor.
