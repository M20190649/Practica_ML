A Multi-Wavelength High Resolution Study of the S255 Star Forming
  Region. General structure and kinematics
We present observational data for two main components (S255IR and S255N) of
the S255 high mass star forming region in continuum and molecular lines
obtained at 1.3 mm and 1.1 mm with the SMA, at 1.3 cm with the VLA and at 23
and 50 cm with the GMRT. The angular resolution was from ~ 2" to ~ 5" for all
instruments. With the SMA we detected a total of about 50 spectral lines of 20
different molecules (including isotopologues). About half of the lines and half
of the species (in particular N2H+, SiO, C34S, DCN, DNC, DCO+, HC3N, H2CO,
H2CS, SO2) have not been previously reported in S255IR and partly in S255N at
high angular resolution. Our data reveal several new clumps in the S255IR and
S255N areas by their millimeter wave continuum emission. Masses of these clumps
are estimated at a few solar masses. The line widths greatly exceed expected
thermal widths. These clumps have practically no association with NIR or radio
continuum sources, implying a very early stage of evolution. At the same time,
our SiO data indicate the presence of high-velocity outflows related to some of
these clumps. In some cases, strong molecular emission at velocities of the
quiescent gas has no detectable counterpart in the continuum. We discuss the
main features of the distribution of NH3, N2H+, and deuterated molecules. We
estimate properties of decimeter wave radio continuum sources and their
relationship with the molecular material.
