Comparison of Two Epochs of the Zeeman Effect in the 44 GHz Class I
  methanol (CH3OH) maser line in OMC-2
We present a second epoch of observations of the 44 GHz Class I methanol
maser line toward the star forming region OMC-2. The observations were carried
out with the Very Large Array, and constitute one of the first successful
Zeeman effect detections with the new WIDAR correlator. Comparing to the result
of our earlier epoch of data for this region, we find that the intensity of the
maser increased by 50%, but the magnetic field value has stayed the same,
within the errors. This suggests that the methanol maser may be tracing the
large-scale magnetic field that is not affected by the bulk gas motions or
turbulence on smaller scales that is causing the change in maser intensity.
