The ATCA HI Galactic Center Survey
We present a survey of atomic hydrogen HI) emission in the direction of the
Galactic Center conducted with the CSIRO Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA). The survey covers the area -5 deg < l < +5, -5 deg < b <+5 deg over the
velocity range -309 < v_{LSR} < 349 km/s with a velocity resolution of 1 km/s.
The ATCA data are supplemented with data from the Parkes Radio Telescope for
sensitivity to all angular scales larger than the 145 arcsec angular resolution
of the survey. The mean rms brightness temperature across the field is 0.7 K,
except near (l,b)=(0 deg, 0 deg) where it increases to ~2 K. This survey
complements the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to complete the continuous
coverage of the inner Galactic plane in HI at ~2 arcmin resolution. Here we
describe the observations and analysis of this Galactic Center survey and
present the final data product. Features such as Bania's Clump 2, the far 3
kiloparsec arm and small high velocity clumps are briefly described.
