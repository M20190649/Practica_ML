A Search for Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) toward Select Astronomical Sources
Observations of 14 rotational transitions of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) using the
NRAO 12 m Telescope on Kitt Peak are reported towards IRC+10216, Orion KL,
Orion S, Sgr B2(N), Sgr B2(OH), W3IRS5, and W51M. Although recent models
suggest the presence of NH2OH in high abundance, these observations resulted in
non-detection. Upper limits are calculated to be as much as six orders of
magnitude lower than predicted by models. Possible explanations for the lower
than expected abundance are explored.
