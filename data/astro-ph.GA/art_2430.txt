The Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) Pilot Survey
We describe a pilot survey conducted with the Mopra 22-m radio telescope in
preparation for the Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90 GHz (MALT90).
We identified 182 candidate dense molecular clumps using six different
selection criteria and mapped each source simultaneously in 16 different lines
near 90 GHz. We present a summary of the data and describe how the results of
the pilot survey shaped the design of the larger MALT90 survey. We motivate our
selection of target sources for the main survey based on the pilot detection
rates and demonstrate the value of mapping in multiple lines simultaneously at
high spectral resolution.
