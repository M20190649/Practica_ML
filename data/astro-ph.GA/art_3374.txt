Magnetic field reversals and galactic dynamos
We argue that global magnetic field reversals similar to those observed in
the Milky Way occur quite frequently in mean-field galactic dynamo models that
have relatively strong, random, seed magnetic fields that are localized in
discrete regions. The number of reversals decreases to zero with reduction of
the seed strength, efficiency of the galactic dynamo and size of the spots of
the seed field. A systematic observational search for magnetic field reversals
in a representative sample of spiral galaxies promises to give valuable
information concerning seed magnetic fields and, in this way, to clarify the
initial stages of galactic magnetic field evolution.
