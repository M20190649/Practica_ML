The Processing of the Clumpy Molecular Gas in the Galactic Center and
  the Star-Formation
We present the Green Bank 100m Telescope (GBT) mapping observations of CS
1-0, and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) 157-pointings mosaic of the 0.86 mm dust
continuum emission as well as several warm and dense gas tracers, in the
central ~20 pc area in Galactic Center. The unprecedentedly large field-of-view
and the high angular resolution of our SMA dust image allow the identification
of abundant 0.1-0.2 pc scale dense gas clumps. We found that in the Galactic
Center, the Class I methanol masers are excellently correlated with the dense
gas clumps. However, on the ~0.1 pc scale, these dense gas clumps still have a
extremely large linewidth (FWHM~10-20 km/s). Simple calculations suggest that
the identified clumps can be possibly the pressurized gas reservoir feeding the
formation of 1-10 solar-mass stars. These gas clumps may be the most promising
candidates for ALMA to resolve the high-mass star-formation in the Galactic
center.
