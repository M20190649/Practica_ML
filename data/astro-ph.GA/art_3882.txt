Towards a census of the Galactic anticentre star clusters - III: tracing
  the spiral structure in the Outer Disk
In this paper we investigate the nature of 27 star cluster candidates, most
of them projected towards the Galactic anticentre. We derive fundamental
parameters for 20 confirmed clusters, among these 7 are new identifications.
Four of the remaining are uncertain cases that require deeper photometry to
establish their nature, and 4 are probably field fluctuations. In addition, we
provide a partial census of the open clusters towards the Galactic anticentre.
We also include in this study some interesting objects outside the anticentre
region, in the second and third Galactic quadrants, mainly in the Perseus and
Outer arms. These clusters confirm the extension of the Outer arm along the
third quadrant. We also point out that the embedded cluster FSR 486, at a
distance of 7.2 +/- 1.3 kpc from de Sun, is projected on the line of sight of
the Local Group irregular dwarf galaxy IC 10. Thus, part of the unusual
properties of IC 10 may be explained by a Galactic contamination. We point out
the importance of embedded clusters in tracing the spiral structure.
