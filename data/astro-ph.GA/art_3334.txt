Milky Way Supermassive Black Hole: Dynamical Feeding from the
  Circumnuclear Environment
The supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A*, at the Galactic Center is
surrounded by a molecular circumnuclear disk (CND) lying between 1.5-4 pc
radii. The irregular and clumpy structures of the CND, suggest dynamical
evolution and episodic feeding of gas towards the central SMBH. New sensitive
data from the SMA and GBT, reveal several >5-10 pc scale molecular arms, which
either directly connect to the CND, or may penetrate inside the CND. The CND
appears to be the convergence of the innermost parts of largescale gas
streamers, which are responding to the central gravitational potential well.
Rather than being a quasi-stationary structure, the CND may be dynamically
evolving, incorporating inflow via streamers, and feeding gas towards the
center.
