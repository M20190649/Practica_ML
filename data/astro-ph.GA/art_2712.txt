Limits on the local density of dark matter
We study the systematic problems in determining the local dark matter density
$\rho_{dm}(R_\odot)$ from kinematics of stars in the Solar Neighbourhood, using
a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. We introduce a new unbiased method for
recovering $\rho_{dm}(R_\odot)$ based on the moments of the Jeans equations,
combined with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique and apply it to real data.
