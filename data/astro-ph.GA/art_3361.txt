Multiwavelength Observations of Massive Stellar Cluster Candidates in
  the Galaxy
The Galaxy appears to be richer in young, massive stellar clusters than
previously known, due to advances in infrared surveys which have uncovered
deeply embedded regions of star formation. Young, massive clusters can
significantly impact the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) and hence radio
observations can also be an important tracer of their activity. Several hundred
cluster candidates are now known by examining survey data. Here we report on
multiwavelength observations of six of these candidates in the Galaxy. We
carried out 4.9 and 8.5 GHz VLA observations of the radio emission associated
with these clusters to obtain the physical characteristics of the surrounding
gas, including the Lyman continuum photon flux and ionized gas mass. Spitzer
Infrared Array Camera observations were also made of these regions, and provide
details on the stellar population as well as the dust continuum and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission. When compared to the known young, massive
clusters in the Galaxy, the six cluster candidates have less powerful Lyman
ionizing fluxes and ionize less of the H II mass in the surrounding ISM.
Therefore, these cluster candidates appear to be more consistent with
intermediate-mass clusters (10^3-10^4 Msun).
