On a possible origin for the lack of old star clusters in the Small
  Magellanic Cloud
We model the dynamical interaction between the Small and Large Magellanic
Clouds and their corresponding stellar cluster populations. Our goal is to
explore whether the lack of old clusters ($\gtrsim 7$ Gyr) in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) can be the result of the capture of clusters by the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as well as their ejection due to the tidal
interaction between the two galaxies. For this purpose we perform a suite of
numerical simulations probing a wide range of parameters for the orbit of the
SMC about the LMC. We find that, for orbital eccentricities $e \geq 0.4$,
approximately 15 per cent of the SMC clusters are captured by the LMC. In
addition, another 20 to 50 per cent of its clusters are ejected into the
intergalactic medium. In general, the clusters lost by the SMC are the less
tightly bound cluster population. The final LMC cluster distribution shows a
spatial segregation between clusters that originally belonged to the LMC and
those that were captured from the SMC. Clusters that originally belonged to the
SMC are more likely to be found in the outskirts of the LMC. Within this
scenario it is possible to interpret the difference observed between the star
field and cluster SMC Age-Metallicity Relationships for ages $\gtrsim 7$ Gyr.
