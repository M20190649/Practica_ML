Homogenized effective temperatures from stellar libraries
External errors of effective temperatures of stars for selected libraries are
estimated from data intercomparisons. It is found that the obtained errors are
mainly in a good correspondence with the published data. The results may be
used to homogenize the effective temperatures by averaging the data (with the
weights inversely proportional to the squared errors) from independent sources.
