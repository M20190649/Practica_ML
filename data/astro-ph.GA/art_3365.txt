The Most Metal-Poor Stars. II. Chemical Abundances of 190 Metal-Poor
  Stars Including 10 New Stars With [Fe/H] < -3.5
We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of 16 elements in 190
metal-poor Galactic halo stars (38 program and 152 literature objects). The
sample includes 171 stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5, of which 86 are extremely metal
poor, [Fe/H] < -3.0. Our program stars include ten new objects with [Fe/H] <
-3.5. We identify a sample of "normal" metal-poor stars and measure the trends
between [X/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the dispersion about the mean trend for
this sample. Using this mean trend, we identify objects that are chemically
peculiar relative to "normal" stars at the same metallicity. These chemically
unusual stars include CEMP-no objects, one star with high [Si/Fe], another with
high [Ba/Sr], and one with unusually low [X/Fe] for all elements heavier than
Na. The Sr and Ba abundances indicate that there may be two nucleosynthetic
processes at lowest metallicity that are distinct from the main r-process.
Finally, for many elements, we find a significant trend between [X/Fe] versus
Teff which likely reflects non-LTE and/or 3D effects. Such trends demonstrate
that care must be exercised when using abundance measurements in metal-poor
stars to constrain chemical evolution and/or nucleosynthesis predictions.
