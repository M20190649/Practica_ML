Completing the Massive Star Population: Striking Into the Field
As a population, field massive stars are relatively enigmatic, and this
review attempts to illuminate this sector of the high-mass stellar population,
which comprises 20 - 25% of the massive stars in star-forming galaxies. The
statistical properties of the field population are vital diagnostics of star
formation theory, cluster dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. We
present evidence that field massive stars originate both in situ and as
runaways from clusters, based on the clustering law, IMF, rotation velocities,
and individual observed in situ candidate field stars. We compare the known
properties of field and cluster massive stars from studies in the Magellanic
Clouds and the Galaxy, including our RIOTS4 complete spectroscopic survey of
SMC OB stars. In addition to the origin of the field massive stars, we discuss
additional properties including binarity, runaway mechanisms, and some evolved
spectral types.
