Hubble Space Telescope Observations of an Outer Field in Omega Centauri:
  A Definitive Helium Abundance
We revisit the problem of the split main sequence (MS) of the globular
cluster omega Centauri, and report the results of two-epoch Hubble Space
Telescope observations of an outer field, for which proper motions give us a
pure sample of cluster members, and an improved separation of the two branches
of the main sequence. Using a new set of stellar models covering a grid of
values of helium and metallicity, we find that the best possible estimate of
the helium abundance of the bluer branch of the MS is Y = 0.39 +/- 0.02. For
the cluster center we apply new techniques to old observations: we use indices
of photometric quality to select a high-quality sample of stars, which we also
correct for differential reddening. We then superpose the color-magnitude
diagram of the outer field on that of the cluster center, and suggest a
connection of the bluer branch of the MS with one of the more prominent among
the many sequences in the subgiant region. We also report a group of undoubted
cluster members that are well to the red of the lower MS.
