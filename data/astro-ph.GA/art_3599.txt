Estimation of the SolarGalactocentric Distance and Rotation Velocity
  from Near-Solar-Circle Objects
We have tested the method of determining the solar Galactocentric distance
R_0 and Galactic rotation velocity $V_0$ modified by Sofue et al. using
near-solar-circle objects. The motion of objects relative to the local standard
of rest has been properly taken into account. We show that when such young
objects as star-forming regions or Cepheids are analyzed, allowance for the
perturbations produced by the Galactic spiral density wave improves the
statistical significance of the estimates. The estimate of R_0=7.25\pm0.32 kpc
has been obtained from 19 star-forming regions. The following estimates have
been obtained from a sample of 14 Cepheids (with pulsation periods P>5^d):
R_0=7.66\pm0.36 kpc and V_0=267\pm 17 km s^{-1}. We consider the influence of
the adopted Oort constant A and the character of stellar proper motions
(Hipparcos or UCAC4). The following estimates have been obtained from a sample
of 18 Cepheids with stellar proper motions from the UCAC4 catalog:
R_0=7.64\pm0.32 kpc and V_0=217\pm 11 km s^{-1}.
