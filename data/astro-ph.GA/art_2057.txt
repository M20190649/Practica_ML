Dispersion of Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds. III
We apply our technique on the dispersion of magnetic fields in molecular
clouds to high spatial resolution Submillimeter Array polarization data
obtained for Orion KL in OMC-1, IRAS 16293, and NGC 1333 IRAS 4A. We show how
one can take advantage of such high resolution data to characterize the
magnetized turbulence power spectrum in the inertial and dissipation ranges.
For Orion KL we determine that in the inertial range the spectrum can be
approximately fitted with a power law k^-(2.9\pm0.9) and we report a value of
9.9 mpc for {\lambda}_AD, the high spatial frequency cutoff presumably due to
turbulent ambipolar diffusion. For the same parameters we have \sim
k^-(1.4\pm0.4) and a tentative value of {\lambda}_AD \simeq 2.2 mpc for NGC
1333 IRAS 4A, and \sim k^-(1.8\pm0.3) with an upper limit of {\lambda}_AD < 1.8
mpc for IRAS 16293. We also discuss the application of the technique to
interferometry measurements and the effects of the inherent spatial filtering
process on the interpretation of the results.
