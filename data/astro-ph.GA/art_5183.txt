The Magellanic Stream and Debris Clouds
We present a study of the discrete clouds and filaments in the Magellanic
Stream using a new high-resolution survey of neutral hydrogen (\HI) conducted
with H75 array of the Australia Telescope Compact Array, complemented by
single-dish data from the Parkes Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS). From the
individual and combined datasets, we have compiled a catalog of 251 clouds and
list their basic parameters, including a morphological description useful for
identifying cloud interactions. We find an unexpectedly large number of
head-tail clouds in the region. The implication for the formation mechanism and
evolution is discussed. The filaments appear to originate entirely from the
Small Magellanic Cloud and extend into the northern end of the Magellanic
Bridge.
