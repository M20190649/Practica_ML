The age-metallicity relationship in the Fornax spheroidal dwarf galaxy
We produce a comprehensive field star age-metallicity relationship (AMR) from
the earliest epoch until ~ 1 Gyr ago for three fields in the Fornax dSph galaxy
by using VI photometric data obtained with FORS1 at the VLT. We find that the
innermost one does not contains dominant very old stars (age > 12 Gyr), whereas
the relatively outer field does not account for representative star field
populations younger than ~ 3 Gyr. When focusing on the most prominent stellar
populations, we find that the derived AMRs are engraved by the evidence of a
outside-in star formation process. The studied fields show bimodal metallicity
distributions peaked at [Fe/H] = (-0.95 +- 0.15) dex and (-1.15 or -1.25 +-
0.05) dex, respectively, but only during the first half of the entire galaxy
lifetime. Furthermore, the more metal-rich population appears to be more
numerous in the outer fields, while in the innermost Fornax field the
contribution of both metallicity populations seems to be similar. We also find
that the metallicity spread ~ 6 Gyr ago is remarkable large, while the
intrinsic metallicity dispersion at ~ 1-2 Gyr results smaller than that for the
relatively older generations of stars. We interpret these outcomes as a result
of a possible merger of two galaxies that would have triggered a star formation
bursting process that peaked between ~ 6 and 9 Gyr ago, depending on the
position of the field in the galaxy.
