NGC 5466: a unique probe of the Galactic halo shape
Stellar streams provide unique probes of galactic potentials, with the longer
streams normally providing the cleaner measurements. In this paper, we show an
example of a short tidal stream that is particularly sensitive to the shape of
the Milky Way's dark matter halo: the globular cluster tidal stream NGC 5466.
This stream has an interesting deviation from a smooth orbit at its western
edge. We show that such a deviation favours an underlying oblate or triaxial
halo (irrespective of plausible variations in the Milky Way disc properties and
the specific halo parametrisation chosen); spherical or prolate halo shapes can
be excluded at a high confidence level. Therefore, more extensive data sets
along the NGC 5466 tidal stream promise strong constraints on the Milky Way
halo shape.
