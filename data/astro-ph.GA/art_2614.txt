The chemical evolution of the Galactic Bulge seen through micro-lensing
  events
Galactic bulges are central to understanding galaxy formation and evolution.
Here we report on recent studies using micro-lensing events to obtain spectra
of high resolution and moderately high signal-to-noise ratios of dwarf stars in
the Galactic bulge. Normally this is not feasible for the faint turn-off stars
in the Galactic bulge, but micro-lensing offers this possibility. Elemental
abundance trends in the Galactic bulge as traced by dwarf stars are very
similar to those seen for dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. We discuss
the implications of the ages and metallicity distribution function derived for
the micro-lensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge.
