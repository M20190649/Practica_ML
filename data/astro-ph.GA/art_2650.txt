The Milky Way stellar populations in CFHTLS fields
We investigate the characteristics of the thick disk in the Canada - France -
Hawaii - Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) fields, complemented at bright
magnitudes with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. The ([Fe/H], Z)
distributions are derived in the W1 and W3 fields, and compared with simulated
maps produced using the Besan\c{c}on model. It is shown that the thick disk,
represented in star-count models by a distinct component, is not an adequate
description of the observed ([Fe/H], Z) distributions in these fields.
