Dissipative phenomena in extended-bodies interactions I: Methods Dwarf
  galaxies of the Local Group and their synthetic CMDs
Dissipative phenomena occurring during the orbital evolution of a dwarf
satellite galaxy around a host galaxy may leave signatures in the star
formation activity and signatures in the colour magnitude diagram of the galaxy
stellar content. Our goal is to reach a simple and qualitative description of
the these complicated phenomena. We develop an analytical and numerical
technique able to study ram pressure, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
Rayleigh-Taylor and tidal forces acting on the star formation processes in
molecular clouds. We consider it together with synthetic colour magnitude
diagrams techniques. We developed a method to investigate the connections
existing between gas consumption processes and star formation processes in the
context of the two extended-body interaction with special attention to the
dwarf galaxies dynamical regime.
