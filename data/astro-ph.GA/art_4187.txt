Multiple Fast Molecular Outflows in the PPN CRL 618
CRL 618 is a well-studied pre-planetary nebula. It has multiple highly
collimated optical lobes, fast molecular outflows along the optical lobes, and
an extended molecular envelope that consists of a dense torus in the equator
and a tenuous round halo. Here we present our observations of this source in CO
J=3-2 and HCN J=4-3 obtained with the Submillimeter Array at up to ~ 0.3"
resolutions. We spatially resolve the fast molecular-outflow region previously
detected in CO near the central star and find it to be composed of multiple
outflows that have similar dynamical ages, and are oriented along the different
optical lobes. We also detect fast molecular outflows further away from the
central star near the tips of the extended optical lobes and a pair of
equatorial outflows inside the dense torus. We find that two episodes of bullet
ejections in different directions are needed, one producing the fast molecular
outflows near the central star, and one producing the fast molecular outflows
near the tips of the extended optical lobes. One possibility to launch these
bullets is the magneto-rotational explosion of the stellar envelope.
