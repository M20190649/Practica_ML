The Most Metal-Poor Stars. III. The Metallicity Distribution Function
  and CEMP Fraction
We examine the metallicity distribution function (MDF) and fraction of
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in a sample that includes 86 stars with
[Fe/H] < -3.0, based on high-resolution, high-S/N spectroscopy, of which some
32 objects lie below [Fe/H] = -3.5. After accounting for the completeness
function, the "corrected" MDF does not exhibit the sudden drop at [Fe/H] = -3.6
that was found in recent samples of dwarfs and giants from the Hamburg/ESO
survey. Rather, the MDF decreases smoothly down to [Fe/H] = -4.1. Similar
results are obtained from the "raw" MDF. We find the fraction of CEMP objects
below [Fe/H] = -3.0 is 23 +/- 6% and 32 +/- 8% when adopting the Beers et al.
and Aoki et al. CEMP definitions, respectively. The former value is in fair
agreement with some previous measurements, which adopt the Beers et al.
criterion.
