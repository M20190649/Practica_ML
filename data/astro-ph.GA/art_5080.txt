UKIRT Widefield Infrared Survey for Fe$^+$
The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Widefield Infrared Survey for
Fe$^+$ (UWIFE) is a 180 deg$^2$ imaging survey of the first Galactic quadrant
(7$^{\circ}$ < l < 62$^{\circ}$; |b| < 1.5$^{\circ}$) using a narrow-band
filter centered on the [Fe II] 1.644 {\mu}m emission line. The [Fe II] 1.644
{\mu}m emission is a good tracer of dense, shock-excited gas, and the survey
will probe violent environments around stars: star-forming regions, evolved
stars, and supernova remnants, among others. The UWIFE survey is designed to
complement the existing UKIRT Widefield Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2;
Froebrich et al. 2011). The survey will also complement existing broad-band
surveys. The observed images have a nominal 5{\sigma} detection limit of 18.7
mag for point sources, with the median seeing of 0.83". For extended sources,
we estimate surface brightness limit of 8.1 x 10$^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$
arcsec$^{-2}$ . In this paper, we present the overview and preliminary results
of this survey.
