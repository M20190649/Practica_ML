Dense Gas in Nearby Galaxies: XVII. The Distribution of Ammonia in
  NGC253, Maffei2 and IC342
The central few 100 pc of galaxies often contain large amounts of molecular
gas. The chemical and physical properties of these extragalactic star formation
regions differ from those in galactic disks, but are poorly constrained. This
study aims to develop a better knowledge of the spatial distribution and
kinetic temperature of the dense neutral gas associated with the nuclear
regions of three prototypical spiral galaxies, NGC253, IC342, and Maffei2. VLA
CnD and D configuration measurements have been made of three ammonia (NH3)
inversion transitions. The (J,K)=(1,1) and (2,2) transitions of NH3 were imaged
toward IC342 and Maffei2. The (3,3) transition was imaged toward NGC253. The
entire flux obtained from single-antenna measurements is recovered for all
three galaxies observed. Derived lower limits to the kinetic temperatures
determined for the giant molecular clouds in the centers of these galaxies are
between 25 and 50K. There is good agreement between the distributions of NH3
and other H2 tracers, such as rare CO isotopologues or HCN, suggesting that NH3
is representative of the distribution of dense gas. The "Western Peak" in IC342
is seen in the (6,6) line but not in lower transitions, suggesting maser
emission in the (6,6) transition.
