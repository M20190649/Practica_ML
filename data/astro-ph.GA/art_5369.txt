Galaxy formation and chemical evolution
The manner the galaxy accretes matter along with the star formation rates at
different epochs, influence the evolution of the stable isotopic inventories of
the galaxy. A detailed analysis is presented here to study the dependence of
the galactic chemical evolution on the accretion scenario of the galaxy along
with the star formation rate during the early accretionary phase of the
galactic thick disk and thin disk. Our results indicate that a rapid early
accretion of the galaxy during the formation of the galactic thick disk along
with an enhanced star formation rate in the early stages of the galaxy
accretion could explain the majority of the galactic chemical evolution trends
of the major elements. Further, we corroborate the recent suggestions regarding
the formation of a massive galactic thick disk rather than the earlier assumed
low mass thick disk.
