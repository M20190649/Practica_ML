A candidate circumbinary Keplerian disk in G35.20-0.74 N: A study with
  ALMA
We report on ALMA observations of continuum and molecular line emission with
0.4" resolution towards the high-mass star forming region G35.20-0.74 N. Two
dense cores are detected in typical hot-core tracers, such as CH3CN, which
reveal velocity gradients. In one of these cores, the velocity field can be
fitted with an almost edge-on Keplerian disk rotating about a central mass of
18 Msun. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent study of the
CO first overtone bandhead emission at 2.3mum towards G35.20-0.74 N. The disk
radius and mass are >2500 au and 3 Msun. To reconcile the observed bolometric
luminosity (3x10^4 Lsun) with the estimated stellar mass of 18 Msun, we propose
that the latter is the total mass of a binary system.
