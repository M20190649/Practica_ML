ALMA detection of the rotating molecular disk wind from the young star
  HD 163296
Disk winds have been postulated as a mechanism for angular momentum release
in protostellar systems for decades. HD 163296 is a Herbig Ae star surrounded
by a disk and has been shown to host a series of HH knots (HH 409) with bow
shocks associated with the farthest knots. Here we present ALMA Science
Verification data of CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 emission which are spatially coincident
with the blue shifted jet of HH knots, and offset from the disk by -18.6 km/s.
The emission has a double corkscrew morphology and extends more than 10" from
the disk with embedded emission clumps coincident with jet knots. We interpret
this double corkscrew as emission from material in a molecular disk wind, and
that the compact emission near the jet knots is being heated by the jet which
is moving at much higher velocities. We show that the J=3-2 emission is likely
heavily filtered by the interferometer, but the J=2-1 emission suffers less due
to the larger beam and measurable angular scales. Excitation analysis suggests
temperatures exceeding 900 K in these compact features, with the wind mass,
momentum and energy being of order 10^{-5} M_sun, 10^{-4} M_sun km/s and
10^{40} erg respectively. The high mass loss rate suggests that this star is
dispersing the disk faster than it is funneling mass onto the star.
