Accretion in action: phase space coherence of stellar debris and
  globular clusters in Andromeda's South-West Cloud
A central tenet of the current cosmological paradigm is that galaxies grow
over time through the accretion of smaller systems. Here, we present new
kinematic measurements near the centre of one of the densest pronounced
substructures, the South-West Cloud, in the outer halo of our nearest giant
neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy. These observations reveal that the kinematic
properties of this region of the South-West Cloud are consistent with those of
PA-8, a globular cluster previously shown to be co-spatial with the stellar
substructure. In this sense the situation is reminiscent of the handful of
globular clusters that sit near the heart of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, a
system that is currently being accreted into the Milky Way, confirming that
accretion deposits not only stars but also globular clusters into the halos of
large galaxies.
