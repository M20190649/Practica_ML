Transformations between WISE, 2MASS, SDSS and BVRI photometric systems:
  I. Transformation equations for dwarfs
We present colour transformations for the conversion of the W1 and W2
magnitudes of WISE photometric system to the Johnson-Cousins' BVRI, SDSS (gri),
and 2MASS (JHK_s) photometric systems, for dwarfs. The W3 and W4 magnitudes
were not considered due to their insufficient signal to noise ratio (S/N). The
coordinates of 825 dwarfs along with their BVRI, gri, and JHK_s data, taken
from Bilir et al. (2008) were matched with the coordinates of stars in the
preliminary data release of WISE (Wright et al., 2010) and a homogeneous dwarf
sample with high S/N ratio have been obtained using the following constraints:
1) the data were dereddened, 2) giants were identified and excluded from the
sample, 3) sample stars were selected according to data quality, 4)
transformations were derived for sub samples of different metallicity range,
and 5) transformations are two colour dependent. These colour transformations,
coupled with known absolute magnitudes at shorter wavelenghts, can be used in
space density evaluation for the Galactic (thin and thick) discs, at distances
larger than the ones evaluated with JHK_s photometry.
