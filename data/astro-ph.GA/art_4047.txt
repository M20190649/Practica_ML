Open Cluster Evolutions in Binary System: How They Dissolved
Binarity among stellar clusters in galaxy is such a reality which has been
realized for a long time, but still hides several questions and problems to be
solved. Some of binary star clusters are formed by close encounter, but the
others are formed together from similar womb. Some of them undergo separation
process, while the others are in the middle of merger toward common future. The
products of merger binary star cluster have typical characteristics which
differ from solo clusters, especially in their spatial distribution and their
stellar members kinematics. On the other hand, these merger products still have
to face dissolving processes triggered by both internal and external factors.
In this study, we performed N-body simulations of merger binary clusters with
different initial conditions. After merging, these clusters dissolve with
greater mass-loss rate because of their angular momentum. These rotating
clusters also experience more deceleration caused by external tidal field.
