Stellar dust production and composition in the Magellanic Clouds
The dust reservoir in the interstellar medium of a galaxy is constantly being
replenished by dust formed in the stellar winds of evolved stars. Due to their
vicinity, nearby irregular dwarf galaxies the Magellanic Clouds provide an
opportunity to obtain a global picture of the dust production in galaxies. The
Small and Large Magellanic Clouds have been mapped with the Spitzer Space
Telescope from 3.6 to 160 {\mu}m, and these wavelengths are especially suitable
to study thermal dust emission. In addition, a large number of individual
evolved stars have been targeted for 5-40 {\mu}m spectroscopy, revealing the
mineralogy of these sources. Here I present an overview on the work done on
determining the total dust production rate in the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds, as well as a first attempt at revealing the global composition of the
freshly produced stardust.
