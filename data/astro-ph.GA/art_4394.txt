The infrared K-band identification of the DSO/G2 source from VLT and
  Keck data
A fast moving infrared excess source (G2) which is widely interpreted as a
core-less gas and dust cloud approaches Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) on a presumably
elliptical orbit. VLT K_s-band and Keck K'-band data result in clear continuum
identifications and proper motions of this about 19m Dusty S-cluster Object
(DSO). In 2002-2007 it is confused with the star S63, but free of confusion
again since 2007. Its near-infrared (NIR) colors and a comparison to other
sources in the field speak in favor of the DSO being an IR excess star with
photospheric continuum emission at 2 microns than a core-less gas and dust
cloud. We also find very compact L'-band emission ($<$0.1'') contrasted by the
reported extended (0.03'' up to about 0.2'' for the tail) Brgamma emission. The
presence of a star will change the expected accretion phenomena, since a
stellar Roche lobe may retain a fraction of the material during and after the
peri-bothron passage.
