The Submillimeter Polarization Spectrum of M17
We present 450 {\mu}m polarimetric observations of the M17 molecular cloud
obtained with the SHARP polarimeter at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.
Across the observed region, the magnetic field orientation is consistent with
previous submillimeter and far-infrared polarization measurements. Our
observations are centered on a region of the molecular cloud that has been
compressed by stellar winds from a cluster of OB stars. We have compared these
new data with previous 350 {\mu}m polarimetry and find an anti-correlation
between the 450 to 350 {\mu}m polarization magnitude ratio and the ratio of 21
cm to 450 {\mu}m intensity. The polarization ratio is lower near the east end
of the studied region where the cloud is exposed to stellar winds and
radiation. At the west end of the region, the polarization ratio is higher. We
interpret the varying polarization spectrum as evidence supporting the
radiative alignment torque (RAT) model for grain alignment, implying higher
alignment efficiency in the region that is exposed to a higher anisotropic
radiation field.
