Filamentary Star Formation in NGC 1275
We examine the star formation in the outer halo of NGC~1275, the central
galaxy in the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), using far ultraviolet and optical
images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We have identified a
population of very young, compact star clusters with typical ages of a few Myr.
The star clusters are organised on multiple-kiloparsec scales. Many of these
star clusters are associated with "streaks" of young stars, the combination of
which has a cometary appearance. We perform photometry on the star clusters and
diffuse stellar streaks, and fit their spectral energy distributions to obtain
ages and masses. These young stellar populations appear to be normal in terms
of their masses, luminosities and cluster formation efficiency; <10% of the
young stellar mass is located in star clusters. Our data suggest star formation
is associated with the evolution of some of the giant gas filaments in NGC~1275
that become gravitationally unstable on reaching and possibly stalling in the
outer galaxy. The stellar streaks then could represent stars moving on
ballistic orbits in the potential well of the galaxy cluster. We propose a
model where star-forming filaments, switched on ~50~Myr ago and are currently
feeding the growth of the NGC~1275 stellar halo at a rate of ~2-3 solar masses
per year. This type of process may also build stellar halos and form isolated
star clusters in the outskirts of youthful galaxies.
