Molecular line contamination in the SCUBA-2 450 μm and 850 μm
  continuum data
Observations of the dust emission using millimetre/submillimetre bolometer
arrays can be contaminated by molecular line flux, such as flux from 12CO. As
the brightest molecular line in the submillimetre, it is important to quantify
the contribution of CO flux to the dust continuum bands. Conversion factors
were used to convert molecular line integrated intensities to flux detected by
bolometer arrays in mJy per beam. These factors were calculated for 12CO line
integrated intensities to the SCUBA-2 850 {\mu}m and 450 {\mu}m bands. The
conversion factors were then applied to HARP 12CO 3-2 maps of NGC 1333 in the
Perseus complex and NGC 2071 and NGC 2024 in the Orion B molecular cloud
complex to quantify the respective 12CO flux contribution to the 850 {\mu}m
dust continuum emission. Sources with high molecular line contamination were
analysed in further detail for molecular outflows and heating by nearby stars
to determine the cause of the 12CO contribution. The majority of sources had a
12CO 3-2 flux contribution under 20 per cent. However, in regions of molecular
outflows, the 12CO can dominate the source dust continuum (up to 79 per cent
contamination) with 12CO fluxes reaching \sim 68 mJy per beam.
