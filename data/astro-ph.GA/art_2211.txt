Searching for new hypercompact HII regions
Hypercompact (HC) HII regions are, by nature, very young HII regions,
associated with the earliest stages of massive star formation. They may
represent the transition phase as an early B-type star grows into an O-type
star. Unfortunately, so few HCHII regions are presently known that their
general attributes and defining characteristics are based on small number
statistics. A larger sample is needed for detailed studies and good statistics.
Class II methanol masers are one of the best indicators of the early stages of
massive star formation. Using the Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey
- the most sensitive blind survey for 6.7 GHz methanol masers to date - we
selected 24 HCHII region candidates. We made EVLA continuum observations at 3.6
and 1.3 cm to search for HCHII regions associated with these masers. We
identified six potential HCHII regions in our sample based on the presence of
optically thick free-free emission. Overall, we find that 30% of the methanol
masers have an associated centimeter radio continuum source (separation less
than 0.1 pc), which is in general agreement with previous studies.
