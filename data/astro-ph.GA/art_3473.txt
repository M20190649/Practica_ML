Discovery of Two New Class II Methanol Maser Transitions in G345.01+1.79
We have used the Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST) to search for new
class II methanol maser transitions towards the southern source G345.01+1.79.
Over a period of 5 days we observed 11 known or predicted class II methanol
maser transitions. Emission with the narrow line width and characteristic
velocity of class II methanol masers (in this source) was detected in 8 of
these transitions, two of which have not previously been reported as masers.
The new class II methanol maser transitions are the 13(-3)-12(-4)E transition
at 104.1 GHz and the 5(1)-4(2)E transition at 216.9 GHz. Both of these are from
transition series for which there are no previous known class II methanol maser
transitions. This takes the total number of known class II methanol maser
series to 10, and the total number of transitions (or transition groups) to 18.
The observed 104.1 GHz maser suggests the presence of two or more regions of
masing gas with similar line of sight velocities, but quite different physical
conditions. Although these newly discovered transitions are likely to be
relatively rare, where they are observed combined studies using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array offer the
prospect to be able to undertake multi-transition methanol maser studies with
unprecedented detail.
