Thin disk kinematics from RAVE and the solar motion
Aims. We study the Milky Way thin disk with the Radial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE) survey. We consider the thin and thick disks as different Galactic
components and present a technique to statistically disentangle the two
populations. Then we focus our attention on the thin disk component. Methods.
We disentangle the thin disk component from amixture of the thin and thick
disks using a data set providing radial velocities, proper motions, and
photometrically determined distances. Results. We present the trend of the
velocity dispersions in the thin disk component of the Milky Way (MW) in the
radial direction above and below the Galactic plane using data from the RAdial
Velocity Experiment (RAVE). The selected sample is a limited subsample from the
entire RAVE catalogue, roughly mapping up to 500 pc above and below the
Galactic plane, a few degrees in azimuthal direction and covering a radial
extension of 2.0 kpc around the solar position. The solar motion relative to
the local standard of rest is also re-determined with the isolated thin disk
component. Major results are the trend of the velocity mean and dispersion in
the radial and vertical direction. In addition the azimuthal components of the
solar motion relative to the local standard of rest and the velocity dispersion
are discussed.
