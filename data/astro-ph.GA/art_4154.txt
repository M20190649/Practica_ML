G10.472+0.027: An Extreme water maser outflow associated with a Massive
  Protostellar Cluster
An Australia Telescope Compact Array search for 22 GHz water masers towards
6.7 GHz class II methanol masers detected in the Methanol Multibeam (MMB)
survey has resulted in the detection of extremely high velocity emission from
one of the sources. The water maser emission associated with this young stellar
object covers a velocity span of nearly 300 km/s. The highest velocity water
maser emission is red-shifted from the systemic velocity by 250 km/s, which is
a new record for high-mass star formation regions. The maser is associated with
a very young late O, or early B star, which may still be actively accreting
matter (and driving the extreme outflow). If that is the case future
observations of the kinematics of this water maser will provide a unique probe
of accretion processes in the highest mass young stellar objects and test
models of water maser formation.
