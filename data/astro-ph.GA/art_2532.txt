Study of the dense molecular gas surrounding the "Extended Green Object"
  G35.03+0.35
We present the results of a new study of the molecular gas associated with
the "extended green object" (EGO) G35.03+0.35. This object, very likely a
massive young stellar object, is embedded in a molecular cloud at the border of
an HII region. The observations were performed with the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in the 12CO and 13CO J=3-2, HCO+ J=4-3, and CS
J=7-6 lines with an angular resolution about 22". From the 12CO J=3-2 line we
discovered outflowing activity of the massive young stellar object. We obtained
a total mass and kinetic energy for the outflows of 30 M_sun and 3000 M_sun
(km/s)^2 (6 x 10^{46} ergs), respectively. We discovered a HCO+ and CS clump
towards the EGO G35.03+0.35. The detection of these molecular species supports
the presence of molecular outflows and a dense molecular envelope with
temperatures and densities above 40 K and 6 x 10^{6} cm^{-3}, respectively.
Using public near- and mid-IR, and sub-mm data we investigated the spectral
energy distribution confirming that EGO G35.03+0.35 is a massive young stellar
object at the earliest evolutionary stage (i.e. a class I young stellar
object). By anlysing radio continuum archival data we found three radio sources
towards the object, suggesting the presence of several young stellar objects in
the region. Our radio continuum analysis is consistent with the presence of at
least one ultracompact HII region and an hypercompact HII region or a
constant-velocity ionized wind source.
