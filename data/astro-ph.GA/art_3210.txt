Power Spectrum Analysis of the OMC1 Image at 1.1 mm Wavelength
We present a 1.1mm emission map of the OMC1 region observed with AzTEC, a new
large-format array composed of 144 silicon-nitride micromesh bolometers, that
was in use at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). These AzTEC
observations reveal dozens of cloud cores and a tail of filaments in a manner
that is almost identical to the submillimeter continuum emission of the entire
OMC1 region at 450 and 850 micronm. We perform Fourier analysis of the image
with a modified periodogram and the density power spectrum, which provides the
distribution of the length scale of the structures, is determined. The expected
value of the periodogram converges to the resulting power spectrum in the mean
squared sense. The present analysis reveals that the power spectrum steepens at
relatively smaller scales. At larger scales, the spectrum flattens and the
power law becomes shallower. The power spectra of the 1.1mm emission show clear
deviations from a single power law. We find that at least three components of
power law might be fitted to the calculated power spectrum of the 1.1mm
emission. The slope of the best fit power law, \gamma ~ -2.7 is similar to
those values found in numerical simulations. The effects of beam size and the
noise spectrum on the shape and slope of the power spectrum are also included
in the present analysis. The slope of the power law changes significantly at
higher spatial frequency as the beam size increases.
