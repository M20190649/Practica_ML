Dynamical Friction in Cuspy Galaxies
It is well known that a large fraction of galaxies have cuspy luminosity
profiles in their central regions, at least within the observational
resolution. In such cases, the often used, simplified, local approximation for
the dynamical friction braking classical term fails when the massive satellite
moves through the inner parts of the galaxy, although the scattering integral
still converges for phase space distribution singularities that are not too
sharp. Here we present preliminary results of our work aiming at finding better
and more reliable results from the integration of motion of massive objects
(globular clusters) in galaxies where the density diverges to the center in a
power law form, with exponent greater than -2.
