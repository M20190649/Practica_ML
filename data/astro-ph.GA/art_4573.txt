Panoramic Spectroscopy of Galaxies with Star-formation Regions. A Study
  of SBS 1202+583
The methods of panoramic (3D) spectroscopy are used in a detailed study of
galaxies with ongoing star formation chosen from among objects in seven
selected fields of the Second Byurakan Survey (SBS). This article deals with
the irregular galaxy SBS 1202+583, which our classification scheme identifies
as being in a continuous phase of starformation. Observations were made with
the panoramic spectrographs MPFS at the 6-m telescope of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences and VAGR at
the 2.6-m telescope of the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory (BAO) in Armenia.
The data are used to construct charts of the radiative fluxes in the continuum
and various emission lines. Special attention is devoted to analyzing the
emission in the H{\alpha} hydrogen recombination line and in the forbidden
low-ionization doublets of nitrogen [NII]{\lambda}{\lambda}6548, 6583 and
sulfur [SII]{\lambda}{\lambda} 6716,6731, and the ratios of the intensities of
the forbidden lines to H{\alpha}. The observable characteristics (sizes,
H{\alpha} fluxes, etc.) of nine HII regions are studied. The estimated current
rates of starformation in the individual HII regions based on the H{\alpha}
fluxes lie within the range of 0.3-1.2 Msun/year. The dependence of the ratio
of the intensities of the emission in these two forbidden doublets on the rate
of star formation in the HII regions is found.
