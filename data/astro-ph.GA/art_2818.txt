On the age of field halo stars (Jofre & Weiss, 2011)
A study of stellar ages of a sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
is presented. The results are consolidated with a set of globular clusters
(GCs) and show that this stellar sample is composed by one dominant population
of 10-12 Gyr old. This supports the Eggen's scenario claiming that the inner
halo of the Milky Way formed rapidly, probably during the collapse of the
proto-Galactic cloud.
