The dust production rate of AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds
We compare theoretical dust yields for stars with mass 1 Msun < mstar < 8
Msun, and metallicities 0.001 < Z < 0.008 with observed dust production rates
(DPR) by carbon- rich and oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (C-AGB and O-AGB)
stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC). The measured DPR of
C-AGB in the LMC are reproduced only if the mass loss from AGB stars is very
efficient during the carbon-star stage. The same yields over-predict the
observed DPR in the SMC, suggesting a stronger metallicity dependence of the
mass-loss rates during the carbon- star stage. DPR of O-AGB stars suggest that
rapid silicate dust enrichment occurs due to efficient hot-bottom-burning if
mstar > 3 Msun and Z > 0.001. When compared to the most recent observations,
our models support a stellar origin for the existing dust mass, if no
significant destruction in the ISM occurs, with a contribution from AGB stars
of 70% in the LMC and 15% in the SMC.
