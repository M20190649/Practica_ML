Stellar populations in the Galactic Bulge (review)
Until recently our knowledge of the Galactic Bulge stellar populations was
based on the study of a few low extinction windows. Large photometric and
spectroscopic surveys are now underway to map large areas of the bulge. They
probe several complex structures which are still to be fully characterized as
well as their links with the inner disc, the thick disc and the inner halo. I
will review our current, rapidly increasing, knowledge of the bulge stellar
populations and the new insight expected towards the Gaia era to disentangle
the formation history of the Galactic inner regions.
