XSL: The X-Shooter Spectral Library
We are building a new spectral library with the X-Shooter instrument on ESO's
VLT: XSL, the X-Shooter Spectral Library. We present our progress in building
XSL, which covers the wavelength range from the near-UV to the near-IR with a
resolution of R ~ 10000. At the time of writing we have collected spectra for
nearly 240 stars. An important feature of XSL is that we have already collected
spectra of more than 100 Asymptotic Giant Branch stars in the Galaxy and the
Magellanic Clouds.
