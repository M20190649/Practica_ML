Manifestations of the Galactic Center Magnetic Field
Several independent lines of evidence reveal that a relatively strong and
highly ordered magnetic field is present throughout the Galaxy's central
molecular zone (CMZ). The field within dense clouds of the central molecular
zone is predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane, probably as a result of
the strong tidal shear in that region. A second magnetic field system is
present outside of clouds, manifested primarily by a population of vertical,
synchrotron-emitting filamentary features aligned with the field. Whether or
not the strong vertical field is uniform throughout the CMZ remains
undetermined, but is a key central issue for the overall energetics and the
impact of the field on the Galactic center arena. The interactions between the
two field systems are considered, as they are likely to drive some of the
activity within the CMZ. As a proxy for other gas-rich galaxies in the local
group and beyond, the Galactic center region reveals that magnetic fields are
likely to be an important diagnostic, if not also a collimator, of the flow of
winds and energetic particles out of the nucleus.
