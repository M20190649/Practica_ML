Analyzing spiral structure in a galactic disk with a gaseous component
Using GADGET2, we performed an SPH+N-body simulation of a galactic disk with
stellar and gas particles. This simulation allows to compare the spiral
structure in the different disk components. Also, we performed a simulation
without gaseous component to explore the effects of the gas in the spiral
pattern of the stars.
