Optical observations of the nearby galaxy IC342 with narrow band [SII]
  and H$Î±$ filters. I
We present observations of the portion of the nearby spiral galaxy IC342
using narrow band [SII] and H$\alpha$ filters. These observations were carried
out in November 2011 with the 2m RCC telescope at Rozhen National Astronomical
Observatory in Bulgaria. In this paper we report coordinates, diameters,
H$\alpha$ and [SII] fluxes for 203 HII regions detected in two fields of view
in IC342 galaxy. The number of detected HII regions is 5 times higher than
previously known in these two parts of the galaxy.
