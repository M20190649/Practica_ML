Sailing under the Magellanic Clouds: A DECam View of the Carina Dwarf
We present deep optical photometry from the DECam imager on the 4m Blanco
telescope of over 12 deg$^2$ around the Carina dwarf spheroidal, with complete
coverage out to 1 degree and partial coverage extending out to 2.6 degrees.
Using a Poisson-based matched filter analysis to identify stars from each of
the three main stellar populations, old, intermediate, and young, we confirm
the previously identified radial age gradient, distance, tidal radius, stellar
radial profiles, relative stellar population sizes, ellipticity, and position
angle. We find an angular offset between the three main elliptical populations
of Carina, and find only tentative evidence for tidal debris, suggesting that
past tidal interactions could not have significantly influenced the Carina
dwarf. We detect stars in the vicinity of, but distinct to, the Carina dwarf,
and measure their distance to be 46$\pm$2 kpc. We determine this population to
be part of the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud at an angular radius of over
20 degrees. Due to overlap in colour-magnitude space with Magellanic stars,
previously detected tidal features in the old population of Carina are likely
weaker than previously thought.
