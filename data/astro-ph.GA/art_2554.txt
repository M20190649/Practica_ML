Local stellar kinematics from RAVE data: II. Radial Metallicity Gradient
We investigate radial metallicity gradients for a sample of dwarf stars from
the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 3 (DR3). We select a total
of approximately 17000 F-type and G-type dwarfs using selection of colour, log
g, and uncertainty on derived space motion, calculate for each star a
probabilistic (kinematic) population assignment to thick or thin disc using
space motion, and additionally another (dynamical) assignment using stellar
vertical orbital eccentricity. We additionally subsample by colour, to provide
samples biased to young thin disc and to older thin disc stars. We derive a
metallicity gradient as a function of Galactocentric radial distance, i.e.
d[M/H]/dR_m=-0.051+/-0.005 dex kpc^-1, for the youngest sample, F-type stars
with vertical orbital eccentricities e_V<=0.04. Samples biased to older thin
disc stars show systematically shallower abundance gradients.
