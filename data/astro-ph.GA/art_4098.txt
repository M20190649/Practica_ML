O~{\small VI} absorption in the Milky Way along the Large Magellanic
  Cloud lines of sight
We have used \textit{Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)}
observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to determine the O {\small VI}
column densities in the Milky Way (MW) towards 6 LMC lines of sight. The mean
column density of O {\small VI} in the MW is found to be log N(O {\small
VI})=14.257$_{-0.084}^{+0.096}$. The results confirm the patchiness of O
{\small VI} absorption in the MW and the column densities are higher or
comparable to the LMC.
