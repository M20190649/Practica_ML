Ionization--induced star formation IV: Triggering in bound clusters
We present a detailed study of star formation occurring in bound
star--forming clouds under the influence of internal ionizing feedback from
massive stars across a spectrum of cloud properties. We infer which objects are
triggered by comparing our feedback simulations with control simulations in
which no feedback was present. We find feedback always results in a lower
star--formation efficiency and usually but not always results in a larger
number of stars or clusters. Cluster mass functions are not strongly affected
by feedback, but stellar mass functions are biased towards lower masses.
Ionization also affects the geometrical distribution of stars in ways that are
robust against projection effects, but may make the stellar associations more
or less subclustered depending on the background cloud environment. We observe
a prominent pillar in one simulation which is the remains of an accretion flow
feeding the central ionizing cluster of its host cloud and suggest that this
may be a general formation mechanism for pillars such as those observed in M16.
We find that the association of stars with structures in the gas such as shells
or pillars is a good but by no means foolproof indication that those stars have
been triggered and we conclude overall that it is very difficult to deduce
which objects have been induced to form and which formed spontaneously simply
from observing the system at a single time.
