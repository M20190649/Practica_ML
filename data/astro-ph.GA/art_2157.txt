Near-Solar-Circle Method for Determination of the Galactic Constants
We propose a method to determine the galactic constants R_0 (distance to the
Galactic Center) and V_0 (rotation velocity of the Sun) from measurements of
distances, radial velocities and proper motions of objects near the solar
circle. This is a modification of the solar-circle method to a more practical
observational method. We apply the method to determine R_0 using data from the
literature with known distances and radial velocities, and obtain R_0 = 7.54
+/- 0.77 kpc.
