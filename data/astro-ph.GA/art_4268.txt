The RAVE harvest: from the relation between abundances and kinematic of
  the Milky Way stars to tools for the abundance analysis of the spectra
RAVE is a spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way which collected more than
500,000 stellar spectra of nearby stars in the Galaxy. The RAVE consortium
analysed these spectra to obtain radial velocities, stellar parameters and
chemical abundances. These data, together with spatial and kinematic
information like positions, proper motions, and distance estimations, make the
RAVE database a rich source for galactic archaeology. I present recent
investigations on the chemo-kinematic relations and chemical gradients in the
Milky Way disk by using RAVE data and compare our results with the Besancon
models. I also present the code SPACE, an evolution of the RAVE chemical
pipeline, which integrates the measurements of stellar parameters and chemical
abundances in one single process.
