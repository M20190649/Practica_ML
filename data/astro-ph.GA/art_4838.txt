Computational Notes on the Numerical Analysis of Galactic Rotation
  Curves
In this paper we present a brief discussion on the salient points of the
computational analysis that are at the basis of the paper \cite{StSc}. The
computational and data analysis have been made with the software
Mathematica$^\circledR$ and presented at Mathematica Italia User Group Meeting
2011.
