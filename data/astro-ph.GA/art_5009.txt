Alignment of the scalar gradient in evolving magnetic fields
We conduct simulations of turbulent mixing in the presence of a magnetic
field, grown by the small-scale dynamo. We show that the scalar gradient field,
$\nabla C$, which must be large for diffusion to operate, is strongly biased
perpendicular to the magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$. This is true both early-on,
when the magnetic field is negligible, and at late times, when the field is
strong enough to back react on the flow. This occurs because $\nabla C$
increases within the plane of a compressive motion, but ${\mathbf B}$ increases
perpendicular to it. At late times the magnetic field resists compression,
making it harder for scalar gradients to grow and likely slowing mixing.
