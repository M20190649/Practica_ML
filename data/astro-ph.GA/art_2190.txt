Cosmic ray propagators in the fractional differential model of bounded
  anomalous diffusion
Fractional differential approach to cosmic ray physics problems is discussed.
A short review in this field is given, some results are represented, analyzed
and criticized. A new model called the bounded anomalous diffusion model is
offered. Its equation includes the fractional material derivative which allows
to take into account the finite speed of cosmic rays particles.
