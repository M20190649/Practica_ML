On the Origin of Young Stars at the Galactic Center
The center of our galaxy is home to a massive black hole, SgrA*, and a
nuclear star cluster containing stellar populations of various ages. While the
late type stars may be too old to have retained memory of their initial orbital
configuration, and hence formation mechanism, the kinematics of the early type
stars should reflect their original distribution. In this contribution we
present a new statistic which uses directly-observable kinematical stellar data
to infer orbital parameters for stellar populations, and is capable of
distinguishing between different origin scenarios. We use it on a population of
B-stars in the Galactic center that extends out to large radii (0.5 pc) from
the massive black hole. We find that the high K-magnitude population form an
eccentric distribution, suggestive of a Hills binary-disruption origin.
