Stream-orbit misalignment I: The dangers of orbit-fitting
Tidal streams don't, in general, delineate orbits. A stream-orbit
misalignment is expected to lead to biases when using orbit-fitting to
constrain models for the Galactic potential. In this first of two papers we
discuss the expected magnitude of the misalignment and the resulting dangers of
using orbit-fitting algorithms to constrain the potential. We summarize data
for known streams which should prove useful for constraining the Galactic
potential, and compute their actions in a realistic Galactic potential. We go
on to discuss the formation of tidal streams in angle-action space, and explain
why, in general, streams do not delineate orbits. The magnitude of the
stream-orbit misalignment is quantified for a logarithmic potential and a
multi-component Galactic potential. Specifically, we focus on the expected
misalignment for the known streams. By introducing a two-parameter family of
realistic Galactic potentials we demonstrate that assuming these streams
delineate orbits can lead to order one errors in the halo flattening and
halo-to-disc force ratio at the Sun. We present a discussion of the dependence
of these results on the progenitor mass, and demonstrate that the misalignment
is mass-independent for the range of masses of observed streams. Hence,
orbit-fitting does not yield better constraints on the potential if one uses
narrower, lower-mass streams.
