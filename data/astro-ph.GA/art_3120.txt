20 cm VLA Radio-Continuum Study of M31 - Images and Point Source
  Catalogues
We present a series of new high-sensitivity and high-resolution
radio-continuum images of M31 at \lambda=20 cm (\nu=1.4 GHz). These new images
were produced by merging archived 20 cm radio-continuum observations from the
Very Large Array (VLA) telescope. Images presented here are sensitive to rms=60
\mu Jy and feature high angular resolution (<10"). A complete sample of
discrete radio sources have been catalogued and analysed across 17 individual
VLA projects. We identified a total of 864 unique discrete radio sources across
the field of M31. One of the most prominent regions in M31 is the ring feature
for which we estimated total integrated flux of 706 mJy at \lambda=20 cm. We
compare here, detected sources to those listed in Gelfand et al. (2004) at
\lambda=92 cm and find 118 sources in common to both surveys. The majority
(61%) of these sources exhibit a spectral index of \alpha <-0.6 indicating that
their emission is predominantly non-thermal in nature. That is more typical for
background objects.
