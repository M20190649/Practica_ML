CGCG 292-057 - a radio galaxy with merger-modulated radio activity
We announce the discovery of a unique combination of features in a radio
source identified with the merger galaxy CGCG 292-057. The radio galaxy both
exhibits a highly complex, X-like structure and shows signs of recurrent
activity in the form of double-double morphology. The outer lobes of CGCG
292-057 are characterized by low radio power, P_{1400MHz} \simeq 2 * 10^{24}
W\Hz^{-1}, placing this source below the FRII/FRI luminosity threshold, and are
highly polarized (almost 20 per cent at 1400 MHz) as is typical of X-shaped
radio sources. The host is a LINER-type galaxy with a relatively low black hole
mass and double-peaked narrow emission lines.
  These features make this galaxy a primary target for studies of
merger-triggered radio activity.
