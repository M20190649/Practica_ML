Gaia constraints on the Galactic thick disc
The Gaia mission, with its unprecedented astrometric and photometric
precision, combined with its Radial Velocity Spectrometer, will provide to the
astronomical community a wealth of necessary constraints to disentangle between
the different formation scenarios of the Galactic thick disc. The aim of this
review is to present some of the recent results obtained spectroscopically
concerning this Galactic structure, and highlight the open questions that still
remain to be answered under the Gaia era. These concern mainly the measurement
of the chemo-dynamical properties of the Milky Way at the inner and outer
parts, which allow us to determine the total accreted mass from the mergers
with satellite galaxies, and will give us an estimate of the strength of the
radial migration phenomena to form such a structure.
