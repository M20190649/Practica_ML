Bibliographic compilation of NIR spectroscopy for stars in the Galactic
  O-Star Catalog
We are carrying out a bibliographic compilation of near-infrared
(NIR)(0.7-5.0 um) spectroscopic studies available for stars in the Galactic O
Star Catalog (GOSC, Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al. 2004). This compilation allows us
to quantify the precise degree of knowledge about NIR spectral information for
GOSC sources, such as band coverage, spectral resolution, equivalent-width
measurements, etc. This bibliographic compilation has a clear next step toward
the development of a new catalog of O-type stars observed only in the NIR,
which will be annexed to the GOSC. In this poster paper we present preliminary
results derived from a set of different attributes extracted from the retrieved
papers.
