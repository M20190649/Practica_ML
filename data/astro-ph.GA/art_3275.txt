The origin of the split red clump in the Galactic bulge of the Milky Way
Near the minor axis of the Galactic bulge, at latitudes b < -5 degrees, the
red giant clump stars are split into two components along the line of sight. We
investigate this split using the three fields from the ARGOS survey that lie on
the minor axis at (l,b) = (0,-5), (0,-7.5), (0,-10) degrees. The separation is
evident for stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 in the two higher-latitude fields, but not
in the field at b = -5 degrees. Stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 do not show the split.
We compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clump stars with
predictions from an evolutionary N-body model of a bulge that grew from a disk
via bar-related instabilities. The density distribution of the peanut-shaped
model is depressed near its minor axis. This produces a bimodal distribution of
stars along the line of sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very much
as seen in our observations. The observed and modelled kinematics of the two
groups of stars are also similar. We conclude that the split red clump of the
bulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks,
and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with
[Fe/H] < -0.5
