Incorporating Streams into Milky Way Models
We develop a framework for modelling the Milky Way using stellar streams and
a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. Through the use of mock
data we demonstrate that a standard suite of Galactic observations leads to
degeneracies in the inferred halo parameters. We then incorporate a GD-1-like
stream into this suite using the orbit-fitting technique and show that the
streams reduces the uncertainties in these parameters provided all observations
are fit simultaneously. We also explore how the assumption of a disk-halo
alignment can lead unphysical models. Our results may explain why some studies
based on the Sagittarius stream find that the halo's intermediate axis is
parallel to the disk spin axis even though such a configuration is highly
unstable. Finally we show that both longer streams and multiple streams lead to
improvements in our ability to infer the shape of our dark halo.
