Tidal radii and destruction rates of globular clusters in the Milky Way
  due to bulge-bar and disk shocking
We calculate orbits, tidal radii, and bulge-bar and disk shocking destruction
rates for 63 globular clusters in our Galaxy. Orbits are integrated in both an
axisymmetric and a non-axisymmetric Galactic potential that includes a bar and
a 3D model for the spiral arms. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we
consider in our simulations observational uncertainties in the kinematical data
of the clusters. In the analysis of destruction rates due to the bulge-bar, we
consider the rigorous treatment of using the real Galactic cluster orbit,
instead of the usual linear trajectory employed in previous studies. We compare
results in both treatments. We find that the theoretical tidal radius computed
in the nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential compares better with the observed
tidal radius than that obtained in the axisymmetric potential. In both Galactic
potentials, bulge-shocking destruction rates computed with a linear trajectory
of a cluster at its perigalacticons give a good approximation to the result
obtained with the real trajectory of the cluster. Bulge-shocking destruction
rates for clusters with perigalacticons in the inner Galactic region are
smaller in the non-axisymmetric potential, as compared with those in the
axisymmetric potential. For the majority of clusters with high orbital
eccentricities (e > 0.5), their total bulge+disk destruction rates are smaller
in the non-axisymmetric potential.
