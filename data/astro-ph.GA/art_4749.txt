Apex determination and detection of stellar clumps in the open cluster M
  67
We determined the cluster apex coordinates, studied the substructures and
performed membership analysis in the central part (34'X33') of the open cluster
M 67. We used the individual stellar apexes method developed earlier and
classical technique of proper motion diagrams in coordinate system connected
with apex. The neighbour-to-neighbour distance technique was applied to detect
space details. The membership list was corrected and some stars were excluded
from the most probable members list. The apex coordinates have been determined
as: A0=132.97deg+/-0.81deg and D0=11.85deg+/-0.90deg. The 2D-space star density
field was analysed and high degree of inhomogeneity was found.
