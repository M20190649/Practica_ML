Structure and radial equilibrium of filamentary molecular clouds
Recent dust continuum surveys have shown that filamentary structures are
ubiquitous along the Galactic plane. While the study of their global properties
has gained momentum recently, we are still far from fully understanding their
origin and stability. Theories invoking magnetic field have been formulated to
help explain the stability of filaments; however, observations are needed to
test their predictions. In this paper, we investigate the structure and radial
equilibrium of five filamentary molecular clouds with the aim of determining
the role that magnetic field may play. To do this, we use continuum and
molecular line observations to obtain their physical properties (e.g. mass,
temperature and pressure). We find that the filaments have lower lineal masses
compared to their lineal virial masses. Their virial parameters and shape of
their dust continuum emission suggests that these filaments may be confined by
a toroidal dominated magnetic field.
