New white dwarfs in the Hyades --Results from kinematic and photometric
  studies
On the basis of the PPMXL catalogue (R\"oser, Demleitner & Schilbach, 2010)
we searched for white dwarfs that are also member candidates of the Hyades in a
region up to 40 pc from the cluster centre. We use the proper motions from
PPMXL in the convergent point method to determine probable kinematic members.
We cross-match the kinematic candidates with catalogues containing white dwarfs
and, finally, check the kinematic with the photometric distances for
consistency. We find the 10 classical white dwarfs in the Hyades and determine
their individual kinematic distances. Additionally, we identified 17 new
probable (former) Hyades white dwarfs, i.e. white dwarfs co-moving with the
bulk space motion of the Hyades cluster. At present, none of them can be
excluded from membership on the basis of the measured radial velocities. For
another 10 objects, the kinematic and the photometric distances are discordant
which rates them as probable non-members. Among the probable members, five
white dwarfs are in binary systems, three are known, two are new. There is good
indication for an empirical magnitude-distance (from centre) relation, such
that the dimmer white dwarfs are farther away from the cluster centre than the
brighter ones. Our sample is getting incomplete close behind the centre of the
cluster. Follow-up observations are encouraged to independently confirm the
predicted radial velocities and the distances of the candidates.
