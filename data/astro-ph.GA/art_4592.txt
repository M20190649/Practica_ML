Constraints on Two Active Galactic Nuclei in the Merger Remnant COSMOS
  J100043.15+020637.2
COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2 is a merger remnant at z = 0.36 with two optical
nuclei, NW and SE, offset by 500 mas (2.5 kpc). Prior studies suggest two
competing scenarios for these nuclei: (1) SE is an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) lost from NW due to a gravitational-wave recoil. (2) NW and SE each
contain an AGN, signaling a gravitational-slingshot recoil or inspiralling
AGNs. We present new images from the Very Large Array (VLA) at a frequency nu =
9.0 GHz and a FWHM resolution theta = 320 mas (1.6 kpc), and the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) at nu = 1.52 GHz and theta = 15 mas (75 pc). The VLA
imaging is sensitive to emission driven by AGNs and/or star formation, while
the VLBA imaging is sensitive only to AGN-driven emission. No radio emission is
detected at these frequencies. Folding in prior results, we find: (a) The
properties of SE and its adjacent X-ray feature resemble those of the
unobscured AGN in NGC 4151, albeit with a much higher narrow emission-line
luminosity. (b) The properties of NW are consistent with it hosting a
Compton-thick AGN that warms ambient dust, photoionizes narrow emission-line
gas and is free-free absorbed by that gas. Finding (a) is consistent with
scenarios (1) and (2). Finding (b) weakens the case for scenario (1) and
strengthens the case for scenario (2). Follow-up observations are suggested.
