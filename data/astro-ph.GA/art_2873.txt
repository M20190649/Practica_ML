Analytical and Monte Carlo results for the surface-brightness diameter
  relationship in supernova remnants
The surface brightness diameter relationship for supernovae remnants (SNRs)
is explained by adopting a model of direct conversion of the flux of kinetic
energy into synchrotron luminosity. Two laws of motion are adopted, a power law
model for the radius-time relationship, and a model which uses the thin layer
approximation. The fluctuations on the log-log surface diameter relationship
are modeled by a Monte Carlo simulation. In this model a new probability
density function for the density as function of the galactic height is
introduced.
