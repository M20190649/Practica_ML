Photometry Study of Open Cluster NGC 7788
A new CCD photometry survey of the open cluster NGC7788 in U, B, V, R and I
colors to magnitude V=20 is present. Extensive comparison of our photometry
with other published dataset shows excellent agreement, indicating that CCD
photometry is capable of producing a uniform set of measurements consistent
with the photometric system defined primarily by the Landolt standard sequence.
For this study we used the 113 stars considered to be cluster members by Becker
on 1965.
