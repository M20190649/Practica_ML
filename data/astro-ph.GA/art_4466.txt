Star Formation Rate Indicators in WISE/SDSS
With the goal of investigating the degree to which the total infrared
luminosity ($L_{\rm TIR}$) traces the star formation rate (SFR), we analyze the
$L_{\rm TIR}$ from the dust in a sample of $\sim$ 6000 star-forming galaxies,
based on the 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 $\mu$m data from the Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE) and u, g, r, i, z band data from SDSS DR9. These
star-forming galaxies are selected by matching the WISE All Sky Catalog with
the star-forming galaxy catalog in SDSS DR9 provided by
JHU/MPA\thanks{$http://www.sdss3.org/dr9/spectro/spectroaccess.php$}. The
values of $L_{\rm TIR}$ and SFR are derived from the project Code Investigating
Galaxy Emission (CIGALE). We study the relationship between the $L_{\rm TIR}$
and SFR. From this study, we derive reference SFR indicators for use in our
analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the $L_{\rm TIR}$ are found, and
calibrations of SFRs based on it are proposed. The calibration holds for
galaxies with verified observations and agrees well with previous works. The
dispersion in the relation between $L_{\rm TIR}$ and SFR could partly be
explained by the galaxy's properties, such as the 4000 {\AA} break.
