ALMA observations of the massive molecular outflow G331.512-0.103
The object of this study is one of the most energetic and luminous molecular
outflows known in the Galaxy, G331.512-0.103. Observations with ALMA Band 7
(350 GHz; 0.86 mm) reveal a very compact, extremely young bipolar outflow and a
more symmetric outflowing shocked shell surrounding a very small region of
ionized gas. The velocities of the bipolar outflow are about 70 km s^{-1} on
either side of the systemic velocity. The expansion velocity of the shocked
shell is ~24 km s^{-1}, implying a crossing time of about 2000 yrs. Along the
symmetry axis of the outflow, there is a velocity feature, which could be a
molecular "bullet" of high-velocity dense material. The source is one of the
youngest examples of massive molecular outflow found associated with a
high-mass star.
