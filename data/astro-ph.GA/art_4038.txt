Ionization driven molecular outflow in K3-50A
Whether high mass stars continue to accrete material beyond the formation of
an HII region is still an open question. Ionized infall and outflow have been
seen in some sources, but their ties to the surrounding molecular gas are not
well constrained. We aim to quantify the ionized and molecular gas dynamics in
a high mass star forming region (K3-50A) and their interaction.
  We present CARMA observations of the 3mm continuum, H41\alpha, and HCO+
emission, and VLA continuum observations at 23 GHz and 14.7 GHz to quantify the
gas and its dynamics in K3-50A. We find large scale dynamics consistent with
previous observations. On small scales, we find evidence for interaction
between the ionized and molecular gas which suggests the ionized outflow is
entraining the molecular one. This is the first time such an outflow entrained
by photo ionized gas has been observed.
  Accretion may be ongoing in K3-50A because an ionized bipolar outflow is
still being powered, which is in turn entraining part of the surrounding
molecular gas. This outflow scenario is similar to that predicted by ionization
feedback models.
