The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE): Third Data Release
We present the third data release of the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE)
which is the first milestone of the RAVE project, releasing the full pilot
survey. The catalog contains 83,072 radial velocity measurements for 77,461
stars in the southern celestial hemisphere, as well as stellar parameters for
39,833 stars. This paper describes the content of the new release, the new
processing pipeline, as well as an updated calibration for the metallicity
based upon the observation of additional standard stars. Spectra will be made
available in a future release. The data release can be accessed via the RAVE
webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org.
