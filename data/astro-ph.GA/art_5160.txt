The Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey VII : A Dense Filament With
  Extremely Long HI Streams
We present completed observations of the NGC 7448 galaxy group and background
volume as part of the blind neutral hydrogen Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey
(AGES). Our observations cover a region spanning 5x4 degrees, over a redshift
range of approximately -2,000 < cz < 20,000 km/s. A total of 334 objects are
detected, mostly in three overdensities at cz $\sim$7,500, cz $\sim$9,600 and
cz $\sim$ 11,400 km/s. The galaxy density is extremely high (15 per square
degree) and many ($\sim$24%) show signs of extended HI emission, including some
features as much as 800 kpc in projected length. We describe the overall
characteristics of this environment : kinematics, typical galaxy colours and
mass to light ratios, and substructure. To aid in the cataloguing of this data
set, we present a new FITS viewer (FRELLED : Fits Realtime Explorer of Low
Latency in Every Dimension). This incorporates interactive source cataloguing
tools which increase our source extraction speed by approximately a factor of
50.
