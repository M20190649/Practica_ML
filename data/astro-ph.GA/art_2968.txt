Newly discovered halos and outer features around southern planetary
  nebulae
We have used the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey to look for faint outer
structures such as halos, ansae and jets around known planetary nebulae across
4000 square degrees of the southern Milky Way. Our search will contribute to a
more accurate census of these features in the Galactic PN population. Candidate
common-envelope PNe have also been identified on the basis of their
microstructures. We also intend to determine more reliable distances for these
PNe, which should allow a much better statistical basis for the post-AGB total
mass budget. Our survey offers fresh scope to address this important issue.
