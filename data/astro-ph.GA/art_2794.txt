High Precision Simulations of the Evolution of a Super Star Cluster
  Around a Massive Black Hole
We present preliminary results of the application of a new sophisticated code
which allows high precision integration of orbits of stars belonging to a dense
stellar system moving in the vicinity of a massive black hole. This mimics the
situation observed in the center of many galaxies, where a nuclear star cluster
contains a massive black hole which, in the past, was, likely, an active engine
of violent emission of radiation. The main scope of our work is the
investigation of the relaxation of the super star cluster on a sufficiently
long time, together with the investigation of its feedback with the massive
black hole.
