Radio-Loud and Radio-Quiet BAL Quasars: A Detailed Ultraviolet
  Comparison
Studies of radio-loud (RL) broad absorption line (BAL) quasars indicate that
popular orientation-based BAL models fail to account for all observations. Are
these results extendable to radio-quiet (RQ) BAL quasars? Comparisons of RL and
RQ BAL quasars show that many of their properties are quite similar. Here we
extend these analyses to the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectral properties,
using a sample of 73 RL and 473 RQ BAL quasars selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). Each RQ quasar is individually matched to a RL quasar in
both redshift (over the range $1.5 < z < 3.5$) and continuum luminosity. We
compare several continuum, emission line, and absorption line properties, as
well as physical properties derived from these measurements. Most properties in
the samples are statistically identical, though we find slight differences in
the velocity structure of the BALs that cause apparent differences in CIV
emission line properties. Differences in the velocities may indicate an
interaction between the radio jets and the absorbing material. We also find
that UV FeII emission is marginally stronger in RL BAL quasars. All of these
differences are subtle, so in general we conclude that RL and RQ BAL QSOs are
not fundamentally different objects, except in their radio properties. They are
therefore likely to be driven by similar physical phenomena, suggesting that
results from samples of RL BAL quasars can be extended to their RQ
counterparts.
