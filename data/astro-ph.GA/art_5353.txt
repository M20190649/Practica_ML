Gemini/GMOS photometry of intermediate-age star clusters in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud
We present Gemini South GMOS g,i photometry of 14 intermediate-age Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) star clusters, namely: NGC 2155, 2161, 2162, 2173, 2203,
2209, 2213, 2231, 2249, Hodge 6, SL 244, 505, 674, and 769, as part of a
continuing project to investigate the extended Main Sequence Turnoff (EMSTO)
phenomenon. Extensive artificial star tests were made over the observed field
of view. These tests reveal the observed behaviour of photometric errors with
magnitude and crowding. The cluster stellar density radial profiles were traced
from star counts over the extent of the observed field. We adopt clus- ter
radii and build colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) with cluster features clearly
identified. We used the cluster (g,g-i) CMDs to estimate ages from the matching
of theoretical isochrones. The studied LMC clusters are confirmed to be
intermediate-age clusters, which range in age 9.10 < log(t) < 9.60. NGC 2162
and NGC 2249 look like new EMSTO candidates, in addition to NGC 2209, on the
basis of having dual red clumps.
