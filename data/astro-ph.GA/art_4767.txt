Estimation of Absolute Magnitude-dependent Galactic Model Parameters In
  Intermediate Latitude With SDSS and SCUSS
Based on SDSS and South Galactic Cap of u-band Sky Survey (SCUSS) early data,
we use star counts method to estimate the Galactic structure parameters in an
intermediate latitude with 10,180 main-sequence (MS) stars in absolute
magnitude interval of $4 \leq M_r \leq 13$. We divide the absolute magnitude
into five intervals:$4 \leq M_r < 5$, $5 \leq M_r < 6$, $6 \leq M_r < 8$, $8
\leq M_r < 10$, $10 \leq M_r \leq 13$, and estimate the Galactic structure
parameters in each absolute magnitude interval to explore their possible
variation with the absolute magnitude. Our study shows the parameters depend on
absolute magnitude. For the thin disk, the intrinsic faint MS stars have large
local space density and they tend to stay close to the Galactic plane. A
plausible explanation is that faint MS stars with long lifetime experience long
gravitational interaction time result in a short scaleheight. However, for the
thick disk, the parameters show a complex trend with absolute magnitude, which
may imply the complicated original of the thick disk. For the halo, the
intrinsic faint MS stars have large local density and small axial ratio, which
indicate a flattened inner halo and a more spherical outer halo.
