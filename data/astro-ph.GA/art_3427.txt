A New Model for the Milky Way Bar
We use Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique to construct
self-consistent models of the Galactic bar. Using $\chi^2$ minimisation, we
find that the best-fit Galactic bar model has a pattern speed $\Omega_{\rm
p}=60 \rm{km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}}$, disk mass $\rm{M_{\rm
d}=1.0\times10^{11}M_{\odot}}$ and bar angle $\theta_{\rm bar}=20^{\circ}$ for
an adopted bar mass $\rm{M_{\rm bar}=2\times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$. The model can
reproduce not only the three-dimensional and projected density distributions
but also velocity and velocity dispersion data from the BRAVA survey. We also
predict the proper motions in the range $l=[-12^{\circ},12^{\circ}]$,
$b=[-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]$, which appear to be higher than observations in
the longitudinal direction. The model is stable within a timescale of 0.5 Gyr,
but appears to deviate from steady-state on longer timescales. Our model can be
further tested by future observations such as those from GAIA.
