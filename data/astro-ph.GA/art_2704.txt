The SEDs of Interacting Galaxies
The evolution of galaxies is greatly influenced by their interactions. As
part of a program to study interacting galaxies, we have measured and modeled
the spectral energy distri- butions (SEDs) from the ultraviolet (UV) to the
far-infrared (FIR). We describe the constraints imposed on star formation
histories by these SEDs, and the variations therein seen across the interaction
sequence, and we compare the results of different star formation rate
prescriptions applied to the data. The sample itself is based on the Spitzer
Interacting Galaxy Survey (SIGS) of 111 galaxies in 50 systems, a project
designed to probe a range of galaxy interaction parameters in the infrared. Our
SEDs combine the Spitzer results with multiwavelength data from other missions,
in particular GALEX and Herschel. The subset presented here is the sample for
which FIR Herschel observations are currently publicly available.
