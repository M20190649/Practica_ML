The Stellar Haloes of Massive Elliptical Galaxies III: Kinematics at
  Large Radius
We present a 2D kinematic analysis out to ~2-5 effective radii (Re) of 33
massive elliptical galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions larger than 150
km/s. Our observations were taken using the Mitchell Spectrograph (formerly
VIRUS-P), a spectrograph with a large 107 x 107 square arcsecond field-of-view
that allows us to construct robust, spatially resolved kinematic maps of the
mean velocity and velocity dispersion for each galaxy extending to at least 2
Re. Using these maps we study the radial dependence of the stellar angular
momentum and other kinematic properties. We see the familiar division between
slow and fast rotators persisting out to large radius in our sample. Centrally
slow rotating galaxies, which are almost universally characterised by some form
of kinematic decoupling or misalignment, remain slowly rotating in their halos.
The majority of fast rotating galaxies show either increases in specific
angular momentum outwards or no change beyond $R_e$. The generally triaxial
nature of the slow rotators suggests that they formed through mergers,
consistent with a "two-phase" picture of elliptical galaxy formation. However,
we do not observe the sharp transitions in kinematics proposed in the
literature as a signpost of moving from central dissipationally-formed
components to outer accretion-dominated haloes.
