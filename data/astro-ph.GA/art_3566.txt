Heterogeneity of the Population of Open Star Clusters in the Galaxy
Based on published data, we have compiled a catalogue of fundamental
astrophysical parameters for 593 open clusters of the Galaxy. In particular,
the catalogue provides the Galactic orbital elements for 500 clusters, the
masses, central concentrations, and ellipticities for 424 clusters, the
metallicities for 264 clusters, and the relative magnesium abundances for 56
clusters. We describe the sources of initial data and estimate the errors in
the investigated parameters. The selection effects are discussed. The chemical
and kinematical properties of the open clusters and field thin-disk stars are
shown to differ. We provide evidence for the heterogeneity of the population of
open clusters.
