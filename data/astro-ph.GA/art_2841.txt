Universal Scaling Function of Velocity Rotation in Spiral galaxies
The data of velocity rotation curve in spiral galaxies, almost for galaxies
which have close central surface brightness, collapse onto a universal scaling
function. Since scaling functions are the signature of emergence in complex
systems we are led to the idea that explanation of constant velocity in spiral
galaxies needs considering cooperative behavior instead of interpretation based
on reductionism approach.
