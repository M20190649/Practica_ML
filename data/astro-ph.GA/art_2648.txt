Optical Spectroscopic Survey of High Latitude WISE Selected Sources
We report on the results of an optical spectroscopic survey at high Galactic
latitude (b\geq30{\deg}) of a sample of WISE-selected targets, grouped by WISE
W1 ({\lambda}_eff = 3.4 \mum) flux, which we use to characterize the sources
WISE detected. We observed 762 targets in 10 disjoint fields centered on
ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) candidates using the DEIMOS spectrograph
on Keck II. We find 0.30 \pm 0.02 galaxies arcmin^-2 with a median redshift of
z=0.33 \pm 0.01 for the sample with W1 \geq 120 \muJy. The foreground stellar
densities in our survey range from 0.23 \pm 0.07 arcmin^(-2) to 1.1 \pm 0.1
arcmin^(-2) for the same sample. We obtained spectra that produced science
grade redshifts for \geq 90% of our targets for sources with W1 flux \geq 120
\muJy that also had i-band flux \geq 18 \muJy. We used for targeting very
preliminary data reductions available to the team in August of 2010. Our
results therefore present a conservative estimate of what is possible to
achieve using WISE's Preliminary Data Release for the study of field galaxies.
