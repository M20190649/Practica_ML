An analysis of HCN observations of the Circumnuclear Disk at the
  galactic centre
The Circumnuclear Disk (CND) is a torus of dust and molecular gas rotating
about the galactic centre and extending from approximately 1.6pc to 7pc from
the central massive black hole, SgrA*. Large Velocity Gradient modelling of the
intensities of the HCN 1-0, 3-2 and 4-3 transitions is used to infer hydrogen
density and HCN optical depth. From HCN observations we find the molecular
hydrogen density ranges from 0.1 to 2 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$, about an
order of magnitude less than inferred previously. The 1-0 line is weakly
inverted with line-centre optical depth approx $-$0.1, in stark contrast to
earlier estimates of 4. The estimated mass of the ring is approximately 3 $-$ 4
$\times$ 10$^{5}$M$_{\odot}$ consistent with estimates based on thermal dust
emission. The tidal shear in the disk implies that star formation is not
expected to occur without some significant triggering event.
