3-Dimensional Kinematics in low foreground extinction windows of the
  Galactic Bulge: Radial Velocities for 6 bulge fields
The detailed structure of the Galactic bulge still remain uncertain. The
strong difficulties of obtaining observations of stars in the Galactic bulge
have hindered the acquisition of a kinematic representation for the inner kpc
of the Milky Way. The observation of the 3-d kinematics in several low
foreground extinction windows can solve this problem. We have developed a new
technique, which combines precise stellar HST positions and proper motions with
integral field spectroscopy, in order to obtain reliable 3-d stellar kinematics
in crowded fields of the Galactic center. In addition, we present results using
the new techniques for six fields in our project. A significant vertex
deviation has been found in some of the fields in agreement with previous
determinations. This result confirms the presence of a stellar bar in the
Galactic bulge.
