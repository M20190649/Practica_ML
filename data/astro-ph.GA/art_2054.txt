Magnetic Field Structure around Low-Mass Class 0 Protostars: B335, L1527
  and IC348-SMM2
We report new 350 micron polarization observations of the thermal dust
emission from the cores surrounding the low-mass, Class 0 YSOs L1527,
IC348-SMM2 and B335. We have inferred magnetic field directions from these
observations, and have used them together with results in the literature to
determine whether magnetically regulated core-collapse and star-formation
models are consistent with the observations. These models predict a pseudo-disk
with its symmetry axis aligned with the core magnetic field. The models also
predict a magnetic field pinch structure on a scale less than or comparable to
the infall radii for these sources. In addition, if the core magnetic field
aligns (or nearly aligns) the core rotation axis with the magnetic field before
core collapse, then the models predict the alignment (or near alignment) of the
overall pinch field structure with the bipolar outflows in these sources. We
show that if one includes the distorting effects of bipolar outflows on
magnetic fields, then in general the observational results for L1527 and
IC348-SMM2 are consistent with these magnetically regulated models. We can say
the same for B335 only if we assume the distorting effects of the bipolar
outflow on the magnetic fields within the B335 core are much greater than for
L1527 and IC348-SMM2. We show that the energy densities of the outflows in all
three sources are large enough to distort the magnetic fields predicted by
magnetically regulated models.
