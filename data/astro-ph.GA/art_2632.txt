On the origin of galactic cosmic rays
It is shown that the relativistic jet, emitted from the center of the Galaxy
during its activity, possessed power and energy spectrum of accelerated protons
sufficient to explain the current cosmic rays distribution in the Galaxy.
Proton acceleration takes place on the light cylinder surface formed by the
rotation of a massive black hole carring into rotation the radial magnetic
field and the magnetosphere. Observed in gamma, x-ray and radio bands bubbles
above and below the galactic plane can be remnants of this bipolar get. The
size of the bubble defines the time of the jet's start, $\simeq 2.4\cdot 10^7$
years ago. The jet worked more than $10^7$ years, but less than $2.4\cdot10^7$
years.
