The Catalog of Edge-on Disk Galaxies from SDSS. Part I: the catalog and
  the Structural Parameters of Stellar Disks
We present a catalog of true edge-on disk galaxies automatically selected
from the Seventh Data Release (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A visual
inspection of the $g$, $r$ and $i$ images of about 15000 galaxies allowed us to
split the initial sample of edge-on galaxy candidates into 4768 (31.8% of the
initial sample) genuine edge-on galaxies, 8350 (55.7%) non-edge-ons, and 1865
(12.5%) edge-on galaxies not suitable for simple automatic analysis because
these objects show signs of interaction, warps, or nearby bright stars project
on it. We added more candidate galaxies from RFGC, EFIGI, RC3, and Galaxy Zoo
catalogs found in the SDSS footprints. Our final sample consists of 5747
genuine edge-on galaxies. We estimate the structural parameters of the stellar
disks (the stellar disk thickness, radial scale length, and central surface
brightness) in the galaxies by analyzing photometric profiles in each of the g,
r, and i images. We also perform simplified 3-D modeling of the light
distribution in the stellar disks of edge-on galaxies from our sample. Our
large sample is intended to be used for studying scaling relations in the
stellar disks and bulges and for estimating parameters of the thick disks in
different types of galaxies via the image stacking. In this paper we present
the sample selection procedure and general description of the sample.
