Submillimeter Observations of Dense Clumps in the Infrared Dark Cloud
  G049.40-00.01
We obtained 350 and 850 micron continuum maps of the infrared dark cloud
G049.40-00.01. Twenty-one dense clumps were identified within G049.40-00.01
based on the 350 micron continuum map with an angular resolution of about 9.6".
We present submillimeter continuum maps and report physical properties of the
clumps. The masses of clumps range from 50 to 600 M_sun. About 70% of the
clumps are associated with bright 24 micron emission sources, and they may
contain protostars. The most massive two clumps show extended, enhanced 4.5
micron emission indicating vigorous star-forming activity. The clump size-mass
distribution suggests that many of them are forming high mass stars.
G049.40-00.01 contains numerous objects in various evolutionary stages of star
formation, from pre-protostellar clumps to HII regions.
