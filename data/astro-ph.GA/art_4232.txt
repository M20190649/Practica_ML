PDR Model Mapping of Obscured H2 Emission and the Line-of-Sight
  Structure of M17-SW
We observed H2 line emission with Spitzer-IRS toward M17-SW and modeled the
data with our PDR code. Derived gas density values of up to few times 10^7
cm^-3 indicate that H2 emission originates in high-density clumps. We discover
that the PDR code can be utilized to map the amount of intervening extinction
obscuring the H2 emission layers, and thus we obtain the radial profile of A_V
relative to the central ionizing cluster NGC 6618. The extinction has a
positive radial gradient, varying between 15--47 mag over the projected
distance of 0.9--2.5 pc from the primary ionizer, CEN 1. These high extinction
values are in good agreement with previous studies of A_V toward stellar
targets in M17-SW. The ratio of data to PDR model values is used to infer the
global line-of-sight structure of the PDR surface, which is revealed to
resemble a concave surface relative to NGC 6618. Such a configuration confirms
that this PDR can be described as a bowl-shaped boundary of the central H II
region in M17. The derived structure and physical conditions are important for
interpreting the fine-structure and rotational line emission from the PDR.
