The First Hypervelocity Star from the LAMOST Survey
We report the first hypervelocity star (HVS) discovered from the LAMOST
spectroscopic survey. It is a B-type star with a heliocentric radial velocity
about 620 km/s, which projects to a Galactocentric radial velocity component of
~477 km/s. With a heliocentric distance of ~13 kpc and an apparent magnitude of
~13 mag, it is the nearest bright HVS currently known. With a mass of ~9Msun,
it is one of the three most massive HVSs discovered so far. The star is
clustered on the sky with many other known HVSs, with the position suggesting a
possible connection to Galactic center structures. With the current
poorly-determined proper motion, a Galactic center origin of this HVS remains
consistent with the data at the 1sigma level, while a disk run-away origin
cannot be excluded. We discuss the potential of the LAMOST survey to discover a
large statistical sample of HVSs of different types.
