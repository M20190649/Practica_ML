An O2If* star found in isolation in the backyard of NGC 3603
In this letter we communicate the identification of a new Galactic O2If* star
(MTT 68) isolated at a projected linear distance of 3 pc from the centre of the
star-burst cluster NGC 3603. From its optical photometry I computed a
bolometric luminosity M_Bol = -10.7, which corresponds to a total stellar
luminosity of 1.5 x 10^{6} L_Sun. It was found an interesting similarity
between MTT 68 and the well known multiple system HD 93129. From Hubble Space
Telescope F656N images of the NGC 3603 field, it was found that MTT 68 is
actually a visual binary system with an angular separation of 0.38 arcsec,
which corresponds to a projected (minimum) linear distance of r_(A-B) = 1.4 x
10^{-2} pc. This value is similar to that for the HD 93129A (O2If*) and HD
93129B (O3.5) pair, r_(A-B) = 3.0 x 10^{-2} pc. On the other hand, HD93129A has
a third closer companion named HD 93129Ab (O3.5) at only 0.053 arcsec, and
taking into account that the X-ray to total stellar luminosity ratio for the
MTT 68 system (L_X/L_Bol 10^{-5}) is about two orders of magnitude above the
canonical value expected for single stars, I suspect that the MTT 68 system
probably hosts another massive companion not resolved by the HST archive
images.
