On the lack of correlation between Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstrom and Lyman
  alpha emission in lensed star-forming galaxies
We examine the Mg II 2796, 2803 Angstrom, Lyman alpha, and nebular line
emission in five bright star-forming galaxies at 1.66<z<1.91 that have been
gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters. All five galaxies show
prominent Mg II emission and absorption in a P Cygni profile. We find no
correlation between the equivalent widths of Mg II and Lyman alpha emission.
The Mg II emission has a broader range of velocities than do the nebular
emission line profiles; the Mg II emission is redshifted with respect to
systemic by 100 to 200 km/s. When present, Lyman alpha is even more redshifted.
The reddest components of Mg II and Lyman alpha emission have tails to 500-600
km/s, implying a strong outflow. The lack of correlation in the Mg II and Lyman
alpha equivalent widths, the differing velocity profiles, and the high ratios
of Mg II to nebular line fluxes together suggest that the bulk of Mg II
emission does not ultimately arise as nebular line emission, but may instead be
reprocessed stellar continuum emission.
