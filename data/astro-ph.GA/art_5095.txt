Fluorine in the solar neighborhood - is it all produced in AGB-stars?
The origin of 'cosmic' fluorine is uncertain, but there are three proposed
production sites/mechanisms: AGB stars, $\nu$ nucleosynthesis in Type II
supernovae, and/or the winds of Wolf-Rayet stars. The relative importance of
these production sites has not been established even for the solar
neighborhood, leading to uncertainties in stellar evolution models of these
stars as well as uncertainties in the chemical evolution models of stellar
populations.
  We determine the fluorine and oxygen abundances in seven bright, nearby
giants with well-determined stellar parameters. We use the 2.3 $\mu$m
vibrational-rotational HF line and explore a pure rotational HF line at 12.2
$\mu$m. The latter has never been used before for an abundance analysis. To be
able to do this we have calculated a line list for pure rotational HF lines. We
find that the abundances derived from the two diagnostics agree.
  Our derived abundances are well reproduced by chemical evolution models only
including fluorine production in AGB-stars and therefore we draw the conclusion
that this might be the main production site of fluorine in the solar
neighborhood. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of using the 12 $\mu$m
HF lines to determine the possible contribution of the $\nu$-process to the
fluorine budget at low metallicities where the difference between models
including and excluding this process is dramatic.
