Triggered star formation in a molecular shell created by a SNR?
We present a study of a new molecular shell, G126.1-0.8-14, using available
multiwavelegth Galactic plane surveys and optical Gemini observations. A well
defined shell-like structure is observed in the CO(1--0) line emission at (l,b)
= (126.1, -0.8), in the velocity range --10.5 to --15.5 km/s. The HI, emission
shows a region of low emissivity inside G126.1-0.8-14, while radio continuum
observations reveal faint non-thermal emission possibly related to this shell.
Optical spectra obtained with Gemini South show the existence of B-type stars
likely to be associated with G126.1-0.8-14. An estimate of the stellar wind
energy injected by these stars show that they alone can not be able to create
such a structure. On the other hand, one supernova explosion would provide
enough energy to generate the shell. Using the MSX, IRAS, and WISE Point Source
Catalogues we have found about 30 young stellar objects candidates, whose birth
could have been triggered by the expansion of G126.1-0.8-14. In this context,
Sh2-187 could be a consequence of the action on its surroundings of the most
massive (and thus most evolve) of the stars formed by the expanding molecular
shell.
