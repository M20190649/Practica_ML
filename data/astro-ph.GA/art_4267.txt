Substructure in bulk velocities of Milky Way disk stars
We find that Galactic disk stars near the anticenter exhibit velocity
asymmetries in both the Galactocentric radial and vertical components across
the mid-plane as well as azimuthally. These findings are based on LAMOST
spectroscopic velocities for a sample of ~400,000 F-type stars, combined with
proper motions from the PPMXL catalog for which we have derived corrections to
the zero points based in part on spectroscopically discovered galaxies and QSOs
from LAMOST. In the region within 2 kpc outside the Sun's radius and +/-2 kpc
from the Galactic midplane, we show that stars above the plane exhibit net
outward radial motions with downward vertical velocities, while stars below the
plane have roughly the opposite behavior. We discuss this in the context of
other recent findings, and conclude that we are likely seeing the signature of
vertical disturbances to the disk due to an external perturbation.
