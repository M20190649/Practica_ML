ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle, a preliminary analysis
We aim to study equatorial disks in rotation and axial outflows in post-AGB
objects, as to disclose the formation and shaping mechanisms in planetary
nebulae. So far, both disks and outflows had not been observed simultaneously.
  We have obtained high-quality ALMA observations of 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 and
12CO J=6-5 line emission in the Red Rectangle, the only post-AGB/protoplanetary
object in which a disk in rotation has been mapped up to date.
  These observations provide an unprecedented description of the complex
structure of this source. Together with an equatorial disk in rotation, we find
a low-velocity outflow that occupies more or less the region placed between the
disk and the optical X-shaped nebula. From our observations and preliminary
modeling of the data, we confirm the previously known properties of the disk
and obtain a first description of the structure, dynamics, and physical
conditions of the outflow.
