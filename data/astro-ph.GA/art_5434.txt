S7 : Probing the physics of Seyfert Galaxies through their ENLR & HII
  Regions
Here we present the first results from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert
Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey (S7) which aims to investigate the physics of
~140 radio-detected southern active Galaxies with z<0.02 through Integral Field
Spectroscopy using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS). This instrument
provides data cubes of the central 38 x 25 arc sec. of the target galaxies in
the waveband 340-710nm with the unusually high resolution of R=7000 in the red
(530-710nm), and R=3000 in the blue (340-560nm). These data provide the
morphology, kinematics and the excitation structure of the extended narrow-line
region, probe relationships with the black hole characteristics and the host
galaxy, measures host galaxy abundance gradients and the determination of
nuclear abundances from the HII regions. From photoionisation modelling, we may
determine the shape of the ionising spectrum of the AGN, discover whether AGN
metallicities differ from nuclear abundances determined from HII regions, and
probe grain destruction in the vicinity of the AGN. Here we present some
preliminary results and modelling of both Seyfert galaxies observed as part of
the survey.
