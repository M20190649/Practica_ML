Erosion of Globular Cluster Systems: The Influence of Radial Anisotropy,
  Central Black Holes and Dynamical Friction
We present the adaptable MUESLI code for investigating dynamics and erosion
processes of globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies. MUESLI follows the orbits of
individual clusters and applies internal and external dissolution processes to
them. Orbit integration is based on the self-consistent field method in
combination with a time-transformed leapfrog scheme, allowing us to handle
velocity-dependent forces like triaxial dynamical friction. In a first
application, the erosion of globular cluster systems (GCSs) in elliptical
galaxies is investigated. Observations show that massive ellipticals have rich,
radially extended GCSs, while some compact dwarf ellipticals contain no GCs at
all. For several representative examples, spanning the full mass scale of
observed elliptical galaxies, we quantify the influence of radial anisotropy,
galactic density profiles, SMBHs, and dynamical friction on the GC erosion
rate. We find that GC number density profiles are centrally flattened in less
than a Hubble time, naturally explaining observed cored GC distributions. The
erosion rate depends primarily on a galaxy's mass, half-mass radius and radial
anisotropy. The fraction of eroded GCs is nearly 100% in compact, M 32 like
galaxies and lowest in extended and massive galaxies. Finally, we uncover the
existence of a violent tidal disruption dominated phase which is important for
the rapid build-up of halo stars.
