Radio-continuum study of Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant
  J0509-6731
We present a detailed study of Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
observations ($\lambda$ = 20, 13, 6 & 3~cm) of supernova remnant (SNR)
J0509--6731 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The remnant has a ring
morphology with brightened regions towards the south-western limb. We also find
a second brightened inner ring which is only seen in the radio-continuum. The
SNR is almost circular, with a diameter ranging from 7 to 8~pc, and a steep
radio spectral index between 36 and 3~cm of $\alpha=-0.73\pm0.02$, which is
characteristic of younger SNRs. We also report detection of radially orientated
polarisation across the remnant at 6~cm, with a mean fractional polarisation
level of $P\cong$~(26~$\pm$~13)%. We find the magnetic field ($\sim$168~$\mu$G)
and $\Sigma - D$ ($\Sigma = $ $1.1\times 10^{-19}$~W
m$^{-2}$~Hz$^{-1}$~sr$^{-1}$ , $D=$ 7.35~pc) to be consistent with other young
remnants.
