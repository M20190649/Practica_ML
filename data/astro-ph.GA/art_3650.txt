NGC5694: another extra-galactic globular cluster
We discuss the chemical composition of six giant stars of the outer Halo
globular cluster NGC5694, through the analysis of UVES@FLAMES high-resolution
spectra. The cluster has an average iron content [Fe/H]=--1.83+-0.01,
solar-scaled [alpha/Fe] ratios and a very low Ba abundance
([Ba/Fe]=--0.71+-0.06). These anomalous abundance patterns are different from
those observed in other Halo globular clusters but similar to those of the
metal-poor stars in typical dwarf spheroidal galaxies. These findings suggest
an extra-galactic origin for NGC5694, likely from a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
