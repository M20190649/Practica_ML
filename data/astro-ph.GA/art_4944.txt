Complexity on dwarf galaxies scale: A bimodal distribution function in
  Sculptor
In previous work we have presented Schwarzschild models of the Sculptor dSph,
demonstrating that this system could be embedded in dark matter halos that are
either cusped or cored. Here we show that the non-parametric distribution
function recovered through Schwarschild's method is bimodal in energy and
angular momentum space for all best fitting mass models explored. We
demonstrate that this bimodality is directly related to the two components
known to be present in Sculptor through stellar populations analysis, although
our method is purely dynamical in nature and does not use this prior
information. It therefore constitutes independent confirmation of the existence
of two physically distinct dynamical components in Sculptor and suggests a
rather complex assembly history for this dwarf galaxy.
