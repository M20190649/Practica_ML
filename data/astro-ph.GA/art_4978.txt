Young Massive Clusters/Associations in the GMC G23.3-0.3
An overview of a spectroscopic survey for massive stars in the direction of
the Galactic giant molecular complex G23.3-0.3 is presented (Messineo et al.
2010, and 2014 A&A submitted). This region is interesting because it is rich in
HII regions and supernova remnants (SNRs). A number of 38 early-type stars, a
new luminous blue variable, and a dozen of red supergiants were detected. We
identified the likely progenitors of the SNRs W41, G22.7-00.2, and
G22.7583-0.4917.
