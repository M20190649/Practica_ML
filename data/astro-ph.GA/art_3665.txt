Mass segregation in the diffuse outer-halo globular cluster Palomar 14
We present an analysis of the radial dependence of the stellar mass function
in the diffuse outer-halo globular cluster Palomar 14. Using archival HST/WFPC2
data of the cluster's central 39 pc (corresponding to ~0.85*r_h) we find that
the mass function in the mass range of 0.55 to 0.85 solar masses is well
approximated by a power-law at all radii. The mass function steepens with
increasing radius, from a shallow power-law slope of 0.66+/-0.32 in the
cluster's centre to a slope of 1.61+/-0.33 beyond the core radius, showing that
the cluster is mass-segregated. This is seemingly in conflict with its long
present-day half-mass relaxation time of ~20 Gyr, and with the recent finding
by Beccari et al. (2011), who interpret the cluster's non-concentrated
population of blue straggler stars as evidence that dynamical segregation has
not affected the cluster yet. We discuss this apparent conflict and argue that
the cluster must have either formed with primordial mass segregation, or that
its relaxation time scale must have been much smaller in the past, i.e. that
the cluster must have undergone a significant expansion.
