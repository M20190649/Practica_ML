Photometric study of Galactic star clusters in the VVV survey
We show the preliminary analysis of some Galactic stellar clusters (GSCls)
candidates and the results of the analysis of two new interesting GSCls found
in the "VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea" (VVV) Survey. The VVV photometric
data are being used also to improve the knowledge of the Galactic structure.
The photometric data are obtained with the new automatic photometric pipeline
VVV-SkZ_pipeline.
