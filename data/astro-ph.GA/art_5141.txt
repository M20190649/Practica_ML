Searching for diffuse light in the M96 Group
We present deep, wide-field imaging of the M96 galaxy group (also known as
the Leo I Group). Down to surface brightness limits of $\mu_{B}=30.1$ and
$\mu_{V}=29.5$, we find no diffuse, large-scale optical counterpart to the "Leo
Ring", an extended HI ring surrounding the central elliptical M105 (NGC 3379).
However, we do find a number of extremely low surface-brightness ($\mu_{B}
\gtrsim 29$) small-scale streamlike features, possibly tidal in origin, two of
which may be associated with the Ring. In addition we present detailed surface
photometry of each of the group's most massive members -- M105, NGC 3384, M96
(NGC 3368), and M95 (NGC 3351) -- out to large radius and low surface
brightness, where we search for signatures of interaction and accretion events.
We find that the outer isophotes of both M105 and M95 appear almost completely
undisturbed, in contrast to NGC 3384 which shows a system of diffuse shells
indicative of a recent minor merger. We also find photometric evidence that M96
is accreting gas from the HI ring, in agreement with HI data. In general,
however, interaction signatures in the M96 Group are extremely subtle for a
group environment, and provide some tension with interaction scenarios for the
formation of the Leo HI Ring. The lack of a significant component of diffuse
intragroup starlight in the M96 Group is consistent with its status as a loose
galaxy group in which encounters are relatively mild and infrequent.
