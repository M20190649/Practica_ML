Time-domain studies of gravitationally lensed quasars (GLQs)
We present the overview and current results of an ongoing optical/NIR
monitoring of seven GLQs with the 2-m Liverpool Robotic Telescope. The
photometric data over the first seven years of this programme (2005-2011) are
leading to high-quality light curves, which in turn are being used as key tools
for different standard and novel studies. While brightness records of
non-lensed distant quasars may contain unrecognized extrinsic variations, one
can disentangle intrinsic from extrinsic signal in certain GLQs. Thus, some
GLQs in our sample allow us to assess their extrinsic and intrinsic variations,
as well as to discuss the origin of both kinds of fluctuations. We also
demonstrate the usefulness of GLQ time-domain data to obtain successful
reverberation maps of inner regions of accretion disks around distant
supermassive black holes, and to estimate redshifts of distant lensing
galaxies.
