A Search for Double-peaked narrow emission line Galaxies and AGNs in the
  LAMOST DR1
LAMOST has released more than two million spectra, which provide the
opportunity to search for double-peaked narrow emission line (NEL) galaxies and
AGNs. The double-peaked narrow-line profiles can be well modeled by two
velocity components, respectively blueshifted and redshifted with respect to
the systemic recession velocity. This paper presents 20 double-peaked NEL
galaxies and AGNs found from LAMOST DR1 using a search method based on
multi-gaussian fit of the narrow emission lines. Among them, 10 have already
been published by other authors, either listed as genuine double-peaked NEL
objects or as asymmetric NEL objects, the remaining 10 being first discoveries.
We discuss some possible origins for double-peaked narrow-line features, as
interaction between jet and narrow line regions, interaction with companion
galaxies and black hole binaries. Spatially resolved optical imaging and/or
follow-up observations in other spectral bands are needed to further discuss
the physical mechanisms at work.
