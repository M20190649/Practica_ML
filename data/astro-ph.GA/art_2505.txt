The distribution of star-forming regions in M33
We use fractal analysis to systematically study the clustering strength of
the distribution of stars, HII regions, molecular gas, and individual giant
molecular clouds in M33 over a wide range of spatial scales. We find a clear
transition from a scale-free behavior at small spatial scales to a nearly
uniform distribution at large scales. The transition region lies in the range
500-1000 pc and it separates the regime of small-scale turbulent motion from
that of large-scale galactic dynamics. The three-dimensional fractal dimension
of bright young stars and molecular gas at small spatial scales is similar to
or less than 1.9 indicating that the interstellar medium in M33 is on average
much more fragmented and irregular than the in the Milky Way.
