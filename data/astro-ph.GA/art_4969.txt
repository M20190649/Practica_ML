The local standard of rest from data on young objects with account for
  the Galactic spiral density wave
To estimate the peculiar velocity of the Sun with respect to the Local
Standard of Rest (LSR), we used young objects in the Solar neighborhood with
distance measurement errors within 10%-15%. These objects were the nearest
Hipparcos stars of spectral classes O-B2.5, masers with trigonometric
parallaxes measured by means of VLBI, and two samples of the youngest and
middle-aged Cepheids. The most significant component of motion of all these
stars is induced by the spiral density wave. As a result of using all these
samples and taking into account the differential Galactic rotation, as well as
the influence of the spiral density wave, we obtained the following components
of the vector of the peculiar velocity of the Sun with respect to the LSR:
(Uo,Vo,Wo)_{LSR}=(6.0,10.6,6.5)+\-(0.5,0.8,0.3) km/s. We have found that
components of the Solar velocity are quite insensitive to errors of the
distance Ro in a broad range of its values, from Ro=7.5 kpc to Ro=8.5 kpc, that
affect the Galactic rotation curve parameters. In the same time, the Solar
velocity components(Uo)_{LSR} and (Vo)_{LSR}$ are very sensitive to the Solar
radial phase in the spiral density wave.
