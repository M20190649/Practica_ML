The Gaia-ESO Survey astrophysical calibration
The Gaia-ESO Survey is a wide field spectroscopic survey recently started
with the FLAMES@VLT in Cerro Paranal, Chile. It will produce radial velocities
more accurate than Gaia's for faint stars (down to V~18), and astrophysical
parameters and abundances for approximately 100000 stars, belonging to all
Galactic populations. 300 nights were assigned in 5 years (with the last year
subject to approval after a detailed report). In particular, to connect with
other ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys, a detailed calibration program
--- for the astrophysical parameters derivation --- is planned, including well
known clusters, Gaia benchmark stars, and special equatorial calibration fields
designed for wide field/multifiber spectrographs.
