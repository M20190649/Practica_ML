Dynamical models of the Galaxy
I discuss the importance of dynamical models for exploiting survey data,
focusing on the advantages of "torus" models. I summarize a number of
applications of these models to the study of the Milky Way, including the
determination of the peculiar Solar velocity and investigation of the Hyades
moving group.
