The flattening of globular clusters: internal rotation or velocity
  anisotropy?
Internal rotation is considered to play a major role in determining the
structure and dynamics of some globular clusters. We present a dynamical
analysis of the photometry and three-dimensional kinematics of 47 Tuc and omega
Cen, by means of a new family of self-consistent axisymmetric rotating models.
The combined use of line-of-sight velocities and proper motions allows us to
obtain a global description of the internal dynamical structure of the objects
together with an estimate of their dynamical distances. The well-relaxed
cluster 47 Tuc is very well interpreted by our dynamical models; in particular,
internal rotation is found to explain the observed morphology. For the
partially relaxed cluster omega Cen, the selected model provides a good
representation of its complex three-dimensional kinematics, in general
qualitative agreement with the observed anisotropy profile, which is
characterized by tangential anisotropy in the outer parts; discrepancies are
found between the observed and the expected ellipticity profile and are
ascribed to the presence of a high degree of radial anisotropy in the
intermediate region and to its interplay with rotation.
