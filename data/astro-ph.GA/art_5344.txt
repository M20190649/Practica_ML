Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Stellar mass functions by Hubble type
We present an estimate of the galaxy stellar mass function and its division
by morphological type in the local (0.025 < z < 0.06) Universe. Adopting robust
morphological classifications as previously presented (Kelvin et al.) for a
sample of 3,727 galaxies taken from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, we
define a local volume and stellar mass limited sub-sample of 2,711 galaxies to
a lower stellar mass limit of M = 10^9.0 M_sun. We confirm that the galaxy
stellar mass function is well described by a double Schechter function given by
M* = 10^10.64 M_sun, {\alpha}1 = -0.43, {\phi}*1 = 4.18 dex^-1 Mpc^-3,
{\alpha}2 = -1.50 and {\phi}*2 = 0.74 dex^-1 Mpc^-3. The constituent
morphological-type stellar mass functions are well sampled above our lower
stellar mass limit, excepting the faint little blue spheroid population of
galaxies. We find approximately 71+3-4% of the stellar mass in the local
Universe is found within spheroid dominated galaxies; ellipticals and S0-Sas.
The remaining 29+4-3% falls predominantly within late type disk dominated
systems, Sab-Scds and Sd-Irrs. Adopting reasonable bulge-to-total ratios
implies that approximately half the stellar mass today resides in spheroidal
structures, and half in disk structures. Within this local sample, we find
approximate stellar mass proportions for E : S0-Sa : Sab-Scd : Sd-Irr of 34 :
37 : 24 : 5.
