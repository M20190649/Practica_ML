Dust-to-Gas Ratios of the GALFA-HI Compact Cloud Catalog
We have searched for infrared dust emission from subsets of compact, Galactic
neutral hydrogen clouds, with the purpose of looking for dust in high-velocity
clouds, identifying low-velocity halo clouds, and investigating the cloud
populations defined in the GALFA-HI Compact Cloud Catalog. We do not detect
dust emission from high-velocity clouds. The lack of dust emission from a group
of low-velocity clouds supports the claim that they are low-velocity halo
clouds. We detect dust in the remaining low-velocity clouds, indicating a
Galactic origin, with a significantly greater dust-to-gas ratio for clouds with
linewidths near 15 km/s. We propose that this is due to dust associated with
ionized gas.
