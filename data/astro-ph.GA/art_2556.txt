The IMF of Field OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
The population of field OB stars are an important component of a galaxy's
stellar content, representing 20-30% of the massive stars. To study this
population, we have undertaken the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star
Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). RIOTS4 surveys a spatially complete
sample of >350 field OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud and will serve as a
key probe of runaways, binaries, and the stellar IMF in the field massive star
population. Here, we focus on the field IMF, which provides an empirical probe
of the star-forming process and is a fundamental property of a stellar
population. Together with photometry from the OGLE survey, RIOTS4 will yield a
definitive stellar IMF for the SMC field massive star population. We present
preliminary results that suggests the field IMF is much steeper, Gamma = 2.9,
than the canonical stellar IMF of Gamma = 1.35. Despite the steep slope, we see
no evidence of a stellar upper mass limit, up to our highest mass star of 65
solar masses.
