A catalogue of 2D photometric decompositions in the SDSS-DR7
  spectroscopic main galaxy sample: preferred models and systematics
We present a catalogue of two-dimensional, point spread function-corrected de
Vacouleurs, S\'{e}rsic, de Vacouleurs+Exponential, and S\'{e}rsic+Exponential
fits of $\sim7\times10^5$ spectroscopically selected galaxies drawn from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. Fits are performed for the SDSS
r band utilizing the fitting routine GALFIT and analysis pipeline PYMORPH. We
compare these fits to prior catalogues. Fits are analysed using a physically
motivated flagging system. The flags suggest that more than 90 per cent of
two-component fits can be used for analysis. We show that the fits follow the
expected behaviour for early and late galaxy types. The catalogues provide a
robust set of structural and photometric parameters for future galaxy studies.
We show that some biases remain in the measurements, e.g. the presence of bars
significantly affect the bulge measurements although the bulge ellipticity may
be used to separate barred and non-barred galaxies, and about 15 percent of
bulges of two-component fits are also affected by resolution. The catalogues
are available in electronic format. We also provide an interface for generating
postage stamp images of the 2D model and residual as well as the 1D profile.
These images can be generated for a user-uploaded list of galaxies on demand.
