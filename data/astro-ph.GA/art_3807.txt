The Influence of Radial Stellar Migration on the Chemical Evolution of
  the Milky Way
Stellar migration is an important dynamical process in Galactic disk. Here we
model the radial stellar migration in the Galactic disk with an analytical
method, then add it to detailed Galactic chemical evolution model to study the
influence of radial stellar migration on the chemical evolution of the Milky
Way, especially for the abundance gradients. We found that the radial stellar
migration in the Galactic disk can make the profile of the G-dwarf metallicity
distribution of the solar neighborhood taller and narrower, thus it becomes
another solution to the "G-dwarf problem". It can also scatter the
age-metallicity relation. However, after the migration, the abundance
distributions along the Galactic radius don't change much, namely the abundance
gradients would not be flattened by the radial stellar migration, which is
different from the predictions of many theoretical works. But it can flatten
the radial gradients of the mean chemical abundance of stars, and older stars
possess flatter abundance gradients than younger stars. The most significant
effect of the radial stellar migration on the chemical abundance is that at a
position it scatters the abundance of stars there from a relatively
concentrated value to a range.
