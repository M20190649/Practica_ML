[S IV] in the NGC 5253 Supernebula: Ionized Gas Kinematics at High
  Resolution
The nearby dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 5253 hosts a deeply embedded
radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of O stars. We have observed
this source in the 10.5{\mu}m line of S+3 at 3.8 kms-1 spectral and 1.4"
spatial resolution, using the high resolution spectrometer TEXES on the IRTF.
The line profile cannot be fit well by a single Gaussian. The best simple fit
describes the gas with two Gaussians, one near the galactic velocity with FWHM
33.6 km s-1 and another of similiar strength and FWHM 94 km s-1 centered \sim20
km s-1 to the blue. This suggests a model for the supernebula in which gas
flows towards us out of the molecular cloud, as in a "blister" or "champagne
flow" or in the HII regions modelled by Zhu (2006).
