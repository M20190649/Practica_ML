Observations and Analysis of High-Resolution Magnetic Field Structures
  in Molecular Clouds
Recent high-angular-resolution (up to 0.7") dust polarization observations
toward star forming regions are summarized. With the Sub-Millimeter Array, the
emission from the dense structures is traced and resolved. The detected
magnetic field morphologies vary from hourglass-like structures to isolated
patches depending on the evolutionary stage of the source. These observed
features have also served as a testbed to develop new analysis methods, with a
particular focus on quantifying the role of the magnetic field in the star
formation process.
