SS 433: The wiggle of the wind
The Balmer H alpha emission line in the stationary spectrum of SS 433 has a
component originating in the wind above the accretion disk. The Doppler motion
of this line is a blurred representation of the motion of the compact object
accreting. I show how this may be understood in terms of emission lasting over
a few days, like radiation from the jet bolides.
