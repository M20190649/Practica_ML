Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission-Line Filter
  Images--II:Physical Conditions
We have performed a detailed analysis of the electron temperature and density
in the the Ring Nebula using the calibrated HST WFC3 images described in the
preceding paper. The electron temperature (Te) determined from [N II] and [O
III] rises slightly and monotonically towards the central star. The observed
equivalent width (EW) in the central region indicates that Te rises as high as
13000 K. In contrast, the low EW's in the outer regions are largely due to
scattered diffuse Galactic radiation by dust. The images allowed determination
of unprecedented small scale variations in Te. These variations indicate that
the mean square area temperature fluctuations are significantly higher than
expected from simple photoionization. The power producing these fluctuations
occurs at scales of less than 3.5E15 cm. This scale length provides a strong
restriction on the mechanism causing the large t^2 values observed.
