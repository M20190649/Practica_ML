The embedded cluster or association Trumpler 37 in IC1396: a search for
  evolutionary constraints
It is currently widely accepted that open star clusters and stellar
associations result from the evolution of embedded star clusters. Parameters
such star formation efficiency, time-scale of gas removal and velocity
dispersion can be determinants of their future as bound or unbound systems.
Finding objects at an intermediate evolution state can provide constraints to
model the embedded cluster evolution. In the HII region IC1396, Trumpler 37 is
an extended young cluster that presents characteristics of an association. We
employed the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry to analysing its
structure and stellar content, and determining its astrophysical parameters. We
also analysed 11 bright-rimmed clouds in IC1396 in order to search for young
infrared star clusters, and the background open star cluster Teutsch 74, to
verify whether it has any contribution to the observed stellar density profile
of Trumpler 37. The derived parameters and comparison with template objects
from other studies lead us to conclude that Trumpler 37, rather than as a star
cluster, will probably emerge from its molecular cloud as an OB association.
