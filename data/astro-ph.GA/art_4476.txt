Using Gas Kinematics To Constrain 3D Models of Disks: IC 2531
We use deep, longslit spectra of the nearby edge on galaxy IC 2531 to obtain
gas kinematics out to 5 radial scale-lengths (40 kpc) and 4 vertical
scale-heights (1.7 kpc). The large vertical range spanned by our data offers
unique leverage to constrain three-dimensional models. The shape of the
observed emission-line profiles offer insights to line-of-sight density
distributions in the disk, and we discuss the possibility that we are seeing
disk-flaring in the ionized gas. Finally, we begin to quantify measurements of
line shape to allow model galaxies to be compared to data across all radii and
heights simultaneously.
