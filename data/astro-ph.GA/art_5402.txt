IRAM-30m large scale survey of $^{12}$CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1)
  emission in the Orion molecular cloud
Using the IRAM 30m telescope we have surveyed a $1\times0.8^{\circ}$ part of
the Orion molecular cloud in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (2-1) lines with a
maximal spatial resolution of $\sim$11" and spectral resolution of $\sim$ 0.4
km~s$^{-1}$. The cloud appears filamentary, clumpy and with a complex
kinematical structure. We derive an estimated mass of the cloud of 7700
M$_{\text{Sun}}$ (half of which is found in regions with visual extinctions
$A_V$ below $\sim$10) and a dynamical age for the nebula of the order of 0.2
Myrs. The energy balance suggests that magnetic fields play an important role
in supporting the cloud, at large and small scales. According to our analysis,
the turbulent kinetic energy in the molecular gas due to outflows is comparable
to turbulent kinetic energy resulting from the interaction of the cloud with
the HII region. This latter feedback appears negative, i.e. the triggering of
star formation by the HII region is inefficient in Orion. The reduced data as
well as additional products such as the column density map are made available
