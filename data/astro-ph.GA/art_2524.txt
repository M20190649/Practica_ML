Galactic Centre star formation: the case of the missing gas disc
We study the dynamical evolution of stars and gas close to the centre of the
Milky Way. Any plausible means of forming the young stars observed at the
Galactic Centre leaves behind a residual gas disc at ~0.01pc radii. We show
that the combined effects of viscous accretion and gravitational interactions
with stars do not remove the residual gas efficiently, and that a substantial
gas disc, interior to the stellar disc, persists for >10Myr after the stars
form. Since no such disc is currently seen at the Galactic Centre we argue that
it has been accreted by the super-massive black hole. This scenario offers an
attractive connection between nuclear star formation and black hole feeding,
and we suggest that the "missing" gas may have been used to power Sgr A*.
