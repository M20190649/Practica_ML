On the origin of the B-stars in the Galactic center
We present a new directly-observable statistic which uses sky position and
proper motion of stars near the Galactic center massive black hole to identify
populations with high orbital eccentricities. It is most useful for stars with
large orbital periods for which dynamical accelerations are difficult to
determine. We apply this statistic to a data set of B-stars with projected
radii 0."1 < p < 25" (~0.004 - 1 pc) from the massive black hole in the
Galactic center. We compare the results with those from N-body simulations to
distinguish between scenarios for their formation. We find that the scenarios
favored by the data correlate strongly with particular K-magnitude intervals,
corresponding to different zero-age main-sequence (MS) masses and lifetimes.
Stars with 14 < mK < 15 (15 - 20 solar masses, t_{MS} = 8-13 Myr) match well to
a disk formation origin, while those with mK > 15 (<15 solar masses, t_{MS} >13
Myr), if isotropically distributed, form a population that is more eccentric
than thermal, which suggests a Hills binary-disruption origin.
