OB stars in the Leading Arm of the Magellanic Stream
We present our spectroscopic program aimed to study some new interesting
features recently discovered in the Magellanic Cloud System. These were
revealed by the spatial distribution of OB-type candidate stars, selected based
on UV, optical and IR photometry and proper motions from existing large-area
catalogs. As a pilot study of our project, we are studying OB-star candidates
in the Leading Arm (LA) of the Magellanic Stream, a gaseous tidal structure
with no stellar counterpart known so far. Our targets group in three clumps
near regions of high HI density in the LA. If confirmed, these young stars
would evidence recent star formation in the LA, and they would help better
understand and constrain the formation of the LA and its interactions with the
Milky Way.
