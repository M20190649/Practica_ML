The spiral structure of our Milky Way
The spiral structure of our Milky Way has not yet been well outlined. HII
regions, giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and 6.7-GHz methanol masers are primary
tracers for spiral arms. We collect and update the database of these tracers
which has been used in Hou, Han & Shi (2009) for mapping the spiral structure.
