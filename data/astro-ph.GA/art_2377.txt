Velocity Anisotropy as a Diagnostic of the Magnetization of the
  Interstellar Medium and Molecular clouds
We use a set of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of fully-developed
(driven) turbulence to study the anisotropy in the velocity field that is
induced by the presence of the magnetic field. In our models we study
turbulence characterized by sonic Mach numbers M_s from 0.7 to 7.5, and Alfven
Mach numbers M_A from 0.4 to 7.7. These are used to produce synthetic
observations (centroid maps) that are analyzed. To study the effect of large
scale density fluctuations and of white noise we have modified the density
fields and obtained new centroid maps, which are analyzed. We show that
restricting the range of scales at which the anisotropy is measured makes the
method robust against such fluctuations. We show that the anisotropy in the
structure function of the maps reveals the direction of the magnetic field for
M_A \lesssim 1.5, regardless of the sonic Mach number. We found that the degree
of anisotropy can be used to determine the degree of magnetization (i.e. M_A)
for M_A \lesssim 1.5. To do this, one needs an additional measure of the sonic
Mach number and an estimate of the LOS magnetic field, both feasible by other
techniques, offering a new opportunity to study the magnetization state of the
interstellar medium.
