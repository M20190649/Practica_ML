Comments on the "Monoceros" affair
This is a brief note to comment on some recent papers addressing the
Monoceros ring. In our view, nothing new was delivered on the matter: No new
evidence or arguments are presented which lead to think that the over-densities
in Monoceros must not be due to the flared thick disc of the Milky Way.
  Again, we restate that extrapolations are easily misleading and that a model
of the Galaxy is not the Galaxy. Raising and discussing exciting possibilities
is healthy. However, enthusiasm should not overtake and produce strong claims
before thoroughly checking simpler and more sensible possibilities within their
uncertainties. In particular, claiming that a reported structure, such as the
Monoceros Ring, is not Galactic (an exciting scenario) should not be done
without rejecting the possibility of being due to the well established warped
and flared disc of the Milky Way (simpler).
