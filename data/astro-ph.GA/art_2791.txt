IRAS03063+5735: A Bowshock Nebula Powered by an Early B Star
Mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope Galactic Legacy Infrared
MidPlane Survey Extraordinaire program reveal that the infrared source IRAS
03063+5735 is a bowshock nebula produced by an early B star, 2MASS
03101044+5747035. We present new optical spectra of this star, classify it as a
B1.5 V, and determine a probable association with a molecular cloud complex at
V_LSR=-38 -- -42 km/s in the outer Galaxy near l=140.59 degr, b=-0.250 degr. On
the basis of spectroscopic parallax, we estimate a distance of 4.0 +/-1 kpc to
both the bowshock nebula and the molecular complex. One plausible scenario is
that this a high-velocity runaway star impinging upon a molecular cloud. We
identify the HII region and stellar cluster associated with IRAS 03064+5638 at
a projected distance of 64 pc as one plausible birth site. The
spectrophotometric distance and linkage to a molecular feature provides another
piece of data helping to secure the ill-determined rotation curve in the outer
Galaxy. As a by-product of spectral typing this star, we present empirical
spectral diagnostic diagrams suitable for approximate spectral classification
of O and B stars using He lines in the little-used yellow-red portion of the
optical spectrum.
