Intermediate-mass black holes in Globular Clusters
For a sample of nine Galactic globular clusters we measured the inner
kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy that we combined with
existing outer kinematic measurements and HST luminosity profiles. With this
information we are able to detect the crucial rise in the velocity-dispersion
profile which indicates the presence of a central black hole. In addition,
N-body simulations compared to our data will give us a deeper insight in the
properties of clusters with black holes and stronger selection criteria for
further studies. For the first time, we obtain a homogeneous sample of globular
cluster integral- field spectroscopy which allows a direct comparison between
clusters with and without an intermediate-mass black hole.
