Star Formation in the Milky Way. The Infrared View
I present a brief review of some of the most recent and active topics of star
formation process in the Milky Way using mid and far infrared observations, and
motivated by the research being carried out by our science group using data
gathered by the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes. These topics include
bringing together the scaling relationships found in extragalactic systems with
that of the local nearby molecular clouds, the synthetic modeling of the Milky
Way and estimates of its star formation rate.
