The Age and Helium Abundance of the Galactic Bulge
I discuss the age and helium abundance of the Galactic bulge stellar
population. I present examples as to how age and helium abundance can be
degenerate observationally, and thus, how unstated assumptions of the
helium-metallicity relation can result in biased age-metallicity
determinations. I summarise efforts to tackle this degeneracy using the red
giant branch bump, forward modelling of microlensing selection effects, and
direct mass and metallicity measurements of stars along the red giant branch. I
make the case that the degeneracy between these two parameters can be resolved
in the near future.
