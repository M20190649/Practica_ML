The M4 Core Project with HST --- I. Overview and First-Epoch
We present an overview of the ongoing Hubble Space Telescope large program
GO-12911. The program is focused on the core of M4, the nearest Galactic
globular cluster, and the observations are designed to constrain the number of
binaries with massive companions (black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs)
by measuring the ``wobble'' of the luminous (main-sequence) companion around
the center of mass of the pair, with an astrometric precision of ~50
micro-arcseconds. The high spatial resolution and stable medium-band PSFs of
WFC3/UVIS will make these measurements possible. In this work we describe: (i)
the motivation behind this study, (ii) our observing strategy, (iii) the many
other investigations enabled by this unique data set, and which of those our
team is conducting, and (iv) a preliminary reduction of the first-epoch
data-set collected on October 10, 2012.
