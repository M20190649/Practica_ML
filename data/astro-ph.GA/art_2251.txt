Disk and Envelope Structure in Class 0 Protostars: II. High Resolution
  Millimeter Mapping of the Serpens Sample
We present high-resolution CARMA 230 GHz continuum imaging of nine deeply
embedded protostars in the Serpens Molecular Cloud, including six of the nine
known Class 0 protostars in Serpens. This work is part of a program to
characterize disk and envelope properties for a complete sample of Class 0
protostars in nearby low-mass star forming regions. Here we present CARMA maps
and visibility amplitudes as a function of uv-distance for the Serpens sample.
Observations are made in the B, C, D, and E antenna configurations, with B
configuration observations utilizing the CARMA Paired Antenna Calibration
System. Combining data from multiple configurations provides excellent
uv-coverage (4-500 klam), allowing us to trace spatial scales from 1e2 to 1e4
AU. We find evidence for compact disk components in all of the observed Class 0
protostars, suggesting that disks form at very early times (t<0.2 Myr) in
Serpens. We make a first estimate of disk masses using the flux at 50 klam,
where the contribution from the envelope should be negligible, assuming an
unresolved disk. The resulting disk masses range from 0.04 Msun to 1.7 Msun,
with a mean of approximately 0.2 Msun. Our high resolution maps are also
sensitive to binary or multiple sources with separations > 250 AU, but
significant evidence of multiplicity on scales <2000 AU is seen in only one
source.
