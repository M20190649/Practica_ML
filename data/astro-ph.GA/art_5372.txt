Trigonometric Parallaxes of Star Forming Regions in the Scutum Spiral
  Arm
We report measurements of trigonometric parallaxes for six high-mass
star-forming regions in the Scutum spiral arm of the Milky Way as part of the
BeSSeL Survey. Combining our measurements with 10 previous measurements from
the BeSSeL Survey yields a total sample of 16 sources in the Scutum arm with
trigonometric parallaxes in the Galactic longitude range from 5 deg to 32 deg.
Assuming a logarithmic spiral model, we estimate a pitch angle of 19.8 (+/-3.1)
deg for the Scutum arm, which is larger than pitch angles reported for other
spiral arms. The high pitch angle of the arm may be due to the arm's proximity
to the Galactic bar. The Scutum arm sources show an average peculiar motion of
4 km/s slower than the Galactic rotation and 8 km/s toward the Galactic center.
While the direction of this non-circular motion has the same sign as determined
for sources in other spiral arms, the motion toward the Galactic center is
greater for the Scutum arm sources.
