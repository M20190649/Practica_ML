Characterizing the Turbulent Properties of the Starless Molecular Cloud
  MBM16
We investigate turbulent properties of the non-star-forming, translucent
molecular cloud, MBM16 by applying the statistical technique of a
two-dimensional spatial power spectrum (SPS) on the neutral hydrogen (HI)
observations obtained by the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI)
survey. The SPS, calculated over the range of spatial scales from 0.1 to 17 pc,
is well represented with a single power-law function, with a slope ranging from
-3.3 to -3.7 and being consistent over the velocity range of MBM16 for a fixed
velocity channel thickness. However, the slope varies significantly with the
velocity slice thickness, suggesting that both velocity and density contribute
to HI intensity fluctuations. By using this variation we estimate the slope of
3D density fluctuations in MBM16 to be -3.7\pm0.2. This is significantly
steeper than what has been found for HI in the Milky Way plane, the Small
Magellanic Cloud, or the Magellanic Bridge, suggesting that interstellar
turbulence in MBM16 is driven on scales >17 pc and that the lack of stellar
feedback could be responsible for the steep power spectrum.
