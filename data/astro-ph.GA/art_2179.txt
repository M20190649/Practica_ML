High-resolution EVLA image of dimethyl ether (CH$_{3}$)$_{2}$O in
  Orion--KL
We report the first sub-arc second (0.65$\arcsec$ $\times$ 0.51$\arcsec$)
image of the dimethyl ether molecule, (CH$_{3}$)$_{2}$O, toward the Orion
Kleinmann-Low nebula (Orion--KL). The observations were carried at 43.4 GHz
with the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). The distribution of the lower energy
transition 6$_{1,5} - 6_{0,6}$, EE (E$\rm_{u}$ = 21 K) mapped in this study is
in excellent agreement with the published dimethyl ether emission maps imaged
with a lower resolution. The main emission peaks are observed toward the
Compact Ridge and Hot Core southwest components, at the northern parts of the
Compact Ridge and in an intermediate position between the Compact Ridge and the
Hot Core. A notable result is that the distribution of dimethyl ether is very
similar to that of another important larger O-bearing species, the methyl
formate (HCOOCH$_{3}$), imaged at lower resolution. Our study shows that higher
spectral resolution (WIDAR correlator) and increased spectral coverage provided
by the EVLA offer new possibilities for imaging complex molecular species. The
sensitivity improvement and the other EVLA improvements make this instrument
well suited for high sensitivity, high angular resolution, molecular line
imaging.
