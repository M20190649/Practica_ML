The Spitzer Local Volume Legacy (LVL) Global Optical Photometry
We present the global optical photometry of 246 galaxies in the Local Volume
Legacy (LVL) survey. The full volume-limited sample consists of 258 nearby (D <
11 Mpc) galaxies whose absolute B-band magnitude span a range of -9.6 < M_B <
-20.7 mag. A composite optical (UBVR) data set is constructed from observed
UBVR and SDSS ugriz imaging, where the ugriz magnitudes are transformed into
UBVR. We present photometry within three galaxy apertures defined at UV,
optical, and IR wavelengths. Flux comparisons between these apertures reveal
that the traditional optical R25 galaxy apertures do not fully encompass
extended sources. Using the larger IR apertures we find color-color
relationships where later-type spiral and irregular galaxies tend to be bluer
than earlier-type galaxies. These data provide the missing optical emission
from which future LVL studies can construct the full panchromatic
(UV-optical-IR) spectral energy distributions.
