The contagion of star-formation: Its origin
Dense pockets of cold, molecular gas precede the formation of stars. During
their infancy and later phases of evolution, stars inject considerable energy
into the interstellar medium by driving shocks either due to ionising radiation
or powerful winds. Interstellar shock-waves sweep up dense shells of gas that
usually propagate at supersonic velocities. It is proposed, in this paper, to
examine the possibility of dense structure-formation and perhaps, future
protostar-formation, in a molecular cloud shocked by such a shell. Here I shall
discuss results of a self-gravitating, 3-dimensional, high-resolution
simulation using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics.
