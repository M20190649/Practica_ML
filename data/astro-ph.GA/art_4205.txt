Search for and Characterization of Open Clusters Toward the Galactic
  Anti-center with Pan-STARRS1
We have used a star-count algorithm based the Panoramic Survey Telescope And
Rapid Response System 3$\pi$ survey data aim to identify and characterize
uncharted open clusters (OCs). With limiting magnitudes of about 22 mag in
\gps, \rps, \ips\ bands and about 20 mag in \zps\ and \yps\ bands, our data are
100 times more sensitive than currently available surveys. We analyzed a trial
region within $20\deg\times20\deg$ field toward the Galactic anticenter and
found 1660 density enhancement regions of which 79 (out of 129) are known OCs,
and 949 are OC candidates.
