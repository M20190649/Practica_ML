The triggering mechanism and properties of ionized outflows in the
  nearest obscured quasars
We have identified ionized outflows in the narrow line region of all but one
SDSS type 2 quasars (QSO2) at z<~0.1 (20/21, detection rate 95%), implying that
this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in this object class also at the lowest z. The
outflowing gas has high densities (n_e>1000 cm-3) and covers a region the size
of a few kpc. This implies ionized outflow masses M~(0.3-2.4)x1e6 Msun and mass
outflow rates M(dot)<few Msun yr-1.
  The triggering mechanism of the outflows is related to the nuclear activity.
The QSO2 can be classified in two groups according to the behavior and
properties of the outflowing gas. QSO2 in Group 1 (5/20 objects) show the most
extreme turbulence, they have on average higher radio luminosities and higher
excess of radio emission. QSO2 in Group 2 (15/20 objects) show less extreme
turbulence, they have lower radio luminosities and, on average, lower or no
radio excess.
  We propose that two competing outflow mechanisms are at work: radio jets and
accretion disk winds. Radio jet induced outflows are dominant in Group 1, while
disk winds dominate in Group 2. We find that the radio jet mode is capable of
producing more extreme outflows. To test this interpretation we predict that:
1) high resolution VLBA imaging will reveal the presence of jets in Group 1
QSO2; 2) the morphology of their extended ionized nebulae must be more highly
collimated and kinematically perturbed.
