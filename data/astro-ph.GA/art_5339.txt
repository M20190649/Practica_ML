Multiwavelength study of the radio emission from a tight galaxy pair Arp
  143
We present results of the recent low-frequency radio observations of a tight
galaxy pair Arp 143 at 234 and 612 MHz. These data are analysed together with
the archive data at 1490, 4860, 8440, and 14940 MHz. From the analysis of the
radio emission we derive constraints on the age of the radio emitting
structures as well as on the properties of their magnetic field. We show that
the collisional ring of NGC 2445 hosts strong magnetic fields (reaching 12
$\mu$G in its northwestern part) manifesting as a steep--spectrum, nonthermal
radiation at radio frequencies. The spectral age of this structure is higher
than estimates derived for the star-forming regions from the H$\alpha$
distribution, suggesting that the radio emission might have a different origin.
The galactic core is of a very young spectral age, suggesting an ongoing
starburst activity. Additionally we identify a possible ridge of emission
between the ring galaxy and its elliptical companion NGC 2444.
