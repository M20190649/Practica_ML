OH+ in Diffuse Molecular Clouds
Near ultraviolet observations of OH+ and OH in diffuse molecular clouds
reveal a preference for different environments. The dominant absorption feature
in OH+ arises from a main component seen in CH+ (that with the highest CH+/CH
column density ratio), while OH follows CN absorption. This distinction
provides new constraints on OH chemistry in these clouds. Since CH+ detections
favor low-density gas with small fractions of molecular hydrogen, this must be
true for OH+ as well, confirming OH+ and H2O+ observations with the Herschel
Space Telescope. Our observed correspondence indicates that the cosmic ray
ionization rate derived from these measurements pertains to mainly atomic gas.
The association of OH absorption with gas rich in CN is attributed to the need
for high enough density and molecular fraction before detectable amounts are
seen. Thus, while OH+ leads to OH production, chemical arguments suggest that
their abundances are controlled by different sets of conditions and that they
coexist with different sets of observed species. Of particular note is that
non-thermal chemistry appears to play a limited role in the synthesis of OH in
diffuse molecular clouds.
