Massive binary black holes in galactic nuclei and their path to
  coalescence
Massive binary black holes form at the centre of galaxies that experience a
merger episode. They are expected to coalesce into a larger black hole,
following the emission of gravitational waves. Coalescing massive binary black
holes are among the loudest sources of gravitational waves in the Universe, and
the detection of these events is at the frontier of contemporary astrophysics.
Understanding the black hole binary formation path and dynamics in galaxy
mergers is therefore mandatory. A key question poses: during a merger, will the
black holes descend over time on closer orbits, form a Keplerian binary and
coalesce shortly after? Here we review progress on the fate of black holes in
both major and minor mergers of galaxies, either gas-free or gas-rich, in
smooth and clumpy circum-nuclear discs after a galactic merger, and in
circum-binary discs present on the smallest scales inside the relic nucleus.
