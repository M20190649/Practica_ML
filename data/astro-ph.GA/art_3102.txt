Statistical Properties of Molecular Clumps in the Galactic Center 50 km
  s$^{-1}$ Molecular Cloud
We present the statistical properties of molecular clumps in the Galactic
center 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud (GCM-0.02-0.07) based on observations of
the CS $J=1-0$ emission line with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array. In the cloud,
37 molecular clumps with local thermal equilibrium (LTE) masses of
$2\times10^2-6\times10^3 M_\odot$ were identified by using the {\it clumpfind}
algorithm. The velocity widths of the molecular clumps are about five-fold
those of Galactic disk molecular clouds with the same radius. The
virial-theorem masses are three-fold the LTE masses. The mass and size spectra
can be described by power laws of $dN/dM\propto M^{-2.6\pm0.1}$ ($M\gtrsim
900M_\odot$) and $dN/dR\propto R^{-5.9\pm0.3}$ ($R\gtrsim 0.35$ pc),
respectively. The statistical properties of the region interacting with the Sgr
A East shell and those of the non-interacting part of the cloud are
significantly different. The interaction probably makes the mass function
steeper, from $dN/dM\propto M^{-2.0\pm0.1}$ in the non-interacting part to
$dN/dM\propto M^{-4.0\pm0.2}$ in the interacting region. On the other hand, the
interaction presumably truncates the size spectrum on the larger side of $R\sim
0.4$ pc.
