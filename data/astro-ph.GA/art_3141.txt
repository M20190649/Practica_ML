Isolated starless cores in IRDCs in the Hi-GAL survey
In a previous paper we identified cores within infrared dark clouds (IRDCs).
We regarded those without embedded sources as the least evolved, and labelled
them starless. Here we identify the most isolated starless cores and model them
using a three-dimensional, multi-wavelength, Monte Carlo, radiative transfer
code. We derive the cores' physical parameters and discuss the relation between
the mass, temperature, density, size and the surrounding interstellar radiation
field (ISRF) for the cores. The masses of the cores were found not to correlate
with their radial size or central density. The temperature at the surface of a
core was seen to depend almost entirely on the level of the ISRF surrounding
the core. No correlation was found between the temperature at the centre of a
core and its local ISRF. This was seen to depend, instead, on the density and
mass of the core.
