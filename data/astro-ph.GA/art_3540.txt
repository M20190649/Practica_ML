The Galactic Magnetic Field
With this Letter, we complete our model of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF),
by using the WMAP7 22 GHz total synchrotron intensity map and our earlier
results to obtain a 13-parameter model of the Galactic random field, and to
determine the strength of the striated random field. In combination with our
22-parameter description of the regular GMF, we obtain a very good fit to more
than forty thousand extragalactic Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) and the WMAP7
22 GHz polarized and total intensity synchrotron emission maps. The data calls
for a striated component to the random field whose orientation is aligned with
the regular field, having zero mean and rms strength ~20% larger than the
regular field. A noteworthy feature of the new model is that the regular field
has a significant out-of-plane component, which had not been considered
earlier. The new GMF model gives a much better description of the totality of
data than previous models in the literature.
