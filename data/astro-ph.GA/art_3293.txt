Understanding the Dynamical State of Globular Clusters: Core-Collapsed
  vs Non Core-Collapsed
We study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters using our H\'enon-type
Monte Carlo code for stellar dynamics including all relevant physics such as
two-body relaxation, single and binary stellar evolution, Galactic tidal
stripping, and strong interactions such as physical collisions and binary
mediated scattering. We compute a large database of several hundred models
starting from broad ranges of initial conditions guided by observations of
young and massive star clusters. We show that these initial conditions very
naturally lead to present day clusters with properties including the central
density, core radius, half-light radius, half-mass relaxation time, and cluster
mass, that match well with those of the old Galactic globular clusters. In
particular, we can naturally reproduce the bimodal distribution in observed
core radii separating the "core-collapsed" vs the "non core-collapsed"
clusters. We see that the core-collapsed clusters are those that have reached
or are about to reach the equilibrium "binary burning" phase. The non
core-collapsed clusters are still undergoing gravo-thermal contraction.
