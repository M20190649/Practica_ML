Zeta Pup: the merger of at least two massive stars
We first discuss the stellar and wind parameters of zeta Pup resulting from
detailed UV diagnostics. These parameters together with the runaway nature of
the star can most easily be explained by dynamical binary-binary or
binary-single star interactions in dense stellar clusters. In this case zeta
Pup is most likely the merger of at least two massive stars.
