Detection of a Bipolar Molecular Outflow Driven by a Candidate First
  Hydrostatic Core
We present new 230 GHz Submillimeter Array observations of the candidate
first hydrostatic core Per-Bolo 58. We report the detection of a 1.3 mm
continuum source and a bipolar molecular outflow, both centered on the position
of the candidate first hydrostatic core. The continuum detection has a total
flux density of 26.6 +/- 4.0 mJy, from which we calculate a total (gas and
dust) mass of 0.11 +/- 0.05 Msun and a mean number density of 2.0 +/- 1.6 X
10^7 cm-3. There is some evidence for the existence of an unresolved component
in the continuum detection, but longer-baseline observations are required in
order to confirm the presence of this component and determine whether its
origin lies in a circumstellar disk or in the dense inner envelope. The bipolar
molecular outflow is observed along a nearly due east-west axis. The outflow is
slow (characteristic velocity of 2.9 km/s), shows a jet-like morphology
(opening semi-angles ~8 degrees for both lobes), and extends to the edges of
the primary beam. We calculate the kinematic and dynamic properties of the
outflow in the standard manner and compare them to several other protostars and
candidate first hydrostatic cores with similarly low luminosities. We discuss
the evidence both in support of and against the possibility that Per-Bolo 58 is
a first hydrostatic core, and we outline future work needed to further evaluate
the evolutionary status of this object.
