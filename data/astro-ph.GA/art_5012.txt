An efficient method to identify galaxy clusters by using SuperCOSMOS,
  2MASS and WISE data
The survey data of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) provide an
opportunity for the identification of galaxy clusters. We present an efficient
method for detecting galaxy clusters by combining the WISE data with
SuperCOSMOS and 2MASS data. After performing star-galaxy separation, we
calculate the number of companion galaxies around the galaxies with photometric
redshifts previously estimated by the SuperCOSMOS, 2MASS and WISE data. A
scaled richness is then defined to identify clusters. From a sky area of 275
deg^2 coincident with Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region, we identify
302 clusters in the redshift range of 0.1<z<0.35, 247 (82%) of which are
previously known SDSS clusters. The results indicate that our method is
efficient for identifying galaxy clusters by using the all sky data of the
SuperCOSMOS, 2MASS and WISE.
