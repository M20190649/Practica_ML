Constraints on the black hole spin in the quasar SDSS
  J094533.99+100950.1
The spin of the black hole is an important parameter which may be responsible
for the properties of the inflow and outflow of the material surrounding a
black hole. Broad band IR/optical/UV spectrum of the quasar SDSS
J094533.99+100950.1 is clearly disk-dominated, with the spectrum peaking up in
the observed frequency range. Therefore, disk fitting method usually used for
Galactic black holes can be used in this object to determine the black hole
spin. We develop the numerical code for computing disk properties, including
radius-dependent hardening factor, and we apply the ray-tracing method to
incorporate all general relativity effects in light propagation. We show that
the simple multicolor disk model gives a good fit, without any other component
required, and the disk extends down to the marginally stable orbit. The best
fit accretion rate is 0.13, well below the Eddington limit, and the black hole
spin is moderate, 0.3. The contour error for the fit combined with the
constraints for the black hole mass and the disk inclination gives a constraint
that the spin is lower than 0.8. We discuss the sources of possible systematic
errors in the parameter determinations.
