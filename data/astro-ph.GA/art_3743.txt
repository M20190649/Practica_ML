The Proper Motion of PSR J0205+6449 in 3C 58
We report on sensitive phase-referenced and gated 1.4-GHz VLBI radio
observations of the pulsar PSR J0205+6449 in the young pulsar-wind nebula 3C
58, made in 2007 and 2010. We employed a novel technique where the ~105-m Green
Bank telescope is used simultaneously to obtain single-dish data used to
determine the pulsar's period as well as to obtain the VLBI data, allowing the
VLBI correlation to be gated synchronously with the pulse to increase the
signal-to-noise. The high timing noise of this young pulsar precludes the
determination of the proper motion from the pulsar timing. We derive the
position of the pulsar accurate at the milliarcsecond level, which is
consistent with a re-determined position from the Chandra X-ray observations.
We reject the original tentative optical identification of the pulsar by
Shearer and Neustroev (2008), but rather identify a different optical
counterpart on their images, with R-band magnitude ~24. We also determine an
accurate proper motion for PSR J0205+6449 of (2.3 +- 0.3) mas/yr, corresponding
to a projected velocity of only (35 +- 6) km/s for a distance of 3.2 kpc, at
p.a. -38 deg. This projected velocity is quite low compared to the velocity
dispersion of known pulsars of ~200 km/s. Our measured proper motion does not
suggest any particular kinematic age for the pulsar.
