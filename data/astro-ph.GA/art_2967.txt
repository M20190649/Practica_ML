Are planetary nebulae derived from multiple evolutionary scenarios?
Our understanding of planetary nebulae has been significantly enhanced as a
result of several recent large surveys (Parker et al., these proceedings).
These new discoveries suggest that the `PN phenomenon' is in fact more
heterogeneous than previously envisaged. Even after the careful elimination of
mimics from Galactic PN catalogues, there remains a surprising diversity in the
population of PNe and especially their central stars. Indeed, several
evolutionary scenarios are implicated in the formation of objects presently
catalogued as PNe. We provide a summary of these evolutionary pathways and give
examples of each. Eventually, a full census of local PNe can be used to
confront both stellar evolution theory and population synthesis models.
