The Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz Survey (MALT90) and ALMA
ALMA will revolutionize our understanding of star formation within our
galaxy, but before we can use ALMA we need to know where to look. The
Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) Survey is a large
international project to map the molecular line emission of over 2,000 dense
clumps in the Galactic plane. MALT90 serves as a pathfinder for ALMA, providing
a large public database of dense molecular clumps associated with high-mass
star formation. In this proceedings, we describe the survey parameters and
share early science highlights from the survey, including (1) a comparison
between galactic and extragalactic star formation relations, (2) chemical
trends in MALT90 clumps, (3) the distribution of high-mass star formation in
the Milky Way, and (4) a discussion of the Brick, the target of successful ALMA
Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 proposals.
