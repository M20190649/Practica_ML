Global survey of star clusters in the Milky Way II. The catalogue of
  basic parameters
Although they are the main constituents of the Galactic disk population, for
half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in the literature nothing
is known except the raw position and an approximate size. The main goal of this
study is to determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and
astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible. On the
basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we used a dedicated data-processing
pipeline to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for
stars in a cluster region. For an input list of 3784 targets from the
literature, we confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them
are open clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For
each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster centre,
the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and age. For about
1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have been determined for
the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also derived the tidal radius.
We estimated additionally average radial velocities for more than 30% of the
confirmed clusters. The present sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central
parts of the Milky Way and its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8
kpc from the Sun and also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small
subset of the oldest open clusters ($\log t \gtrsim 9$) we found some evidence
of incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.
