Constraining the Milky Way potential using the dynamical kinematic
  substructures
We present a method to constrain the potential of the non-axisymmetric
components of the Galaxy using the kinematics of stars in the solar
neighborhood. The basic premise is that dynamical substructures in phase-space
(i.e. due to the bar and/or spiral arms) are associated with families of
periodic or irregular orbits, which may be easily identified in orbital
frequency space. We use the "observed" positions and velocities of stars as
initial conditions for orbital integrations in a variety of gravitational
potentials. We then compute their characteristic frequencies, and study the
structure present in the frequency maps. We find that the distribution of
dynamical substructures in velocity- and frequency-space is best preserved when
the integrations are performed in the "true" gravitational potential.
