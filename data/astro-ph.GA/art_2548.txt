PAndromeda - first results from the high-cadence monitoring of M31 with
  Pan-STARRS 1
The Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey of M31 (PAndromeda) is designed to identify
gravitational microlensing events, caused by bulge and disk stars
(self-lensing) and by compact matter in the halos of M31 and the Milky Way
(halo lensing, or lensing by MACHOs). With the 7 deg2 FOV of PS1, the entire
disk of M31 can be imaged with one single pointing. Our aim is to monitor M31
with this wide FOV with daily sampling (20 mins/day). In the 2010 season we
acquired in total 91 nights towards M31, with 90 nights in the rP1 and 66
nights in the iP1. The total integration time in rP1 and iP1 are 70740s and
36180s, respectively. As a preliminary analysis, we study a 40'\times40'
sub-field in the central region of M31, a 20'\times20' sub-field in the disk of
M31 and a 20'\times20' sub-field for the investigation of astrometric
precision. We demonstrate that the PSF is good enough to detect microlensing
events. We present light curves for 6 candidate microlensing events. This is a
competitive rate compared to previous M31 microlensing surveys. We finally also
present one example light curve for Cepheids, novae and eclipsing binaries in
these sub-fields.
