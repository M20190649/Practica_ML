Magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the presence of a radiation
  field
The purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamical role of a radiation
field on the growth rate of the unstable Kelvin - Helmholtz (KH) perturbations.
As a first step toward this purpose, the analyze is done in a general way,
irrespective of applying the model to a specific astronomical system. The
transition zone between the two layers of the fluid is ignored. Then, we
perform a linear analysis and by imposing suitable boundary conditions and
considering a radiation field, we obtain appropriate dispersion relation.
Unstable modes are studied by solving the dispersion equation numerically, and
then growth rates of them are obtained. By analyzing our dispersion relation,
we show that for a wide range of the input parameters, the radiation field has
a destabilizing effect on KH instability. In eruptions of the galaxies or
supermassive stars, the radiation field is dynamically important and because of
the enhanced KH growth rates in the presence of the radiation; these eruptions
can inject more momentum and energy into their environment and excite more
turbulent motions.
