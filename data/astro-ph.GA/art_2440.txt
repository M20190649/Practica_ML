Disks and outflows in the massive protobinary system W3(OH)TW
Sensitive and high angular resolution ($\sim$ $0\rlap.{"}7$) (sub)millimeter
line and continuum observations of the massive star forming region W3(OH) made
with the Submillimeter Array are presented. We report the first detection of
two bipolar outflows emanating from the young and massive "Turner-Welch" [TW]
protobinary system detected by the emission of the carbon monoxide. The
outflows are massive (10 M$_\odot$), highly-collimated (10$^\circ$), and seem
to be the extended molecular component of the strong radio jets and a 22 GHz
maser water outflow energized also by the stars in the W3(OH)TW system.
Observations of the 890 $\mu$m continuum emission and the thermal emission of
the CH$_3$OH might suggest the presence of two rotating circumstellar disk-like
structures associated with the binary system. The disks-like structures have
sizes of about 1500 AU, masses of a few M$_\odot$ and appear to energize the
molecular outflows and radio jets. We estimate that the young stars feeding the
outflows and that are surrounded by the massive disk-like structures maybe are
B-type.
