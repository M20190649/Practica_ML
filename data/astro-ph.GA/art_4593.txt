Wide-field variability survey of the globular cluster NGC 4833
We present preliminary results of the variability survey in the field of the
glo bular cluster NGC 4833. We observed all 34 variable stars known in the
cluster. In add ition, we have found two new SX Phoenicis stars, one new RR
Lyrae star, twelve new ecli psing systems mostly of the W Ursae Majoris type,
nine new variable red giants, and ten new field-stars showing irregular
variations. Properties of RR Lyrae stars indicate that NGC 4833 is an
Oosterhoff's type II globular cluster.
