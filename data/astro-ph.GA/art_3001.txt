The structure of molecular gas associated with NGC2264: wide-field 12CO
  and H2 imaging
We present wide-field, high-resolution imaging observations in 12CO 3-2 and
H2 1-0 S(1) towards a ~1 square degree region of NGC2264. We identify 46 H2
emission objects, of which 35 are new discoveries. We characterize several
cores as protostellar, reducing the previously observed ratio of
prestellar/protostellar cores in the NGC2264 clusters. The length of H2 jets
increases the previously reported spatial extent of the clusters. In each
cluster, <0.5% of cloud material has been perturbed by outflow activity. A
principal component analysis of the 12CO data suggests that turbulence is
driven on scales >2.6 pc, which is larger than the extent of the outflows. We
obtain an exponent alpha=0.74 for the size-linewidth relation, possibly due to
the high surface density of NGC2264. In this very active, mixed-mass star
forming region, our observations suggest that protostellar outflow activity is
not injecting energy and momentum on a large enough scale to be the dominant
source of turbulence.
