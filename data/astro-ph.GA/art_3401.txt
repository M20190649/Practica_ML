Investigating the source of Planck-detected AME: high resolution
  observations at 15 GHz
The Planck 28.5 GHz maps were searched for potential Anomalous Microwave
Emission (AME) regions on the scale of $\sim3^{\circ}$ or smaller, and several
new regions of interest were selected. Ancillary data at both lower and higher
frequencies were used to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which
seem to confirm an excess consistent with spinning dust models. Here we present
higher resolution observations of two of these new regions with the Arcminute
Microkelvin Imager Small Array (AMI SA) between 14 and 18 GHz to test for the
presence of a compact ($\sim$10 arcmin or smaller) component. For
AME-G107.1+5.2, dominated by the {\sc Hii} region S140, we find evidence for
the characteristic rising spectrum associated with the either the spinning dust
mechanism for AME or an ultra/hyper-compact \textsc{Hii} region across the AMI
frequency band, however for AME-G173.6+2.8 we find no evidence for AME on
scales of $\sim 2-10$ arcmin.
