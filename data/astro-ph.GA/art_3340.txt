Spatial distribution and interpretation of the 3.3 \mum PAH emission
  band of the Red Rectangle
The spatial distribution of 3.3 \mum PAH and associated emission in the 3.3"
x 6.0" inner region of the Red Rectangle nebula has been determined using the
UIST imager-spectrometer at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT).
Interpretation of the 3.3 \mum feature as comprising two spectroscopic
components centred at 3.30 \mum and 3.28 \mum, as put forward by Song et al.
(2003, 2007), is supported by these data which reveal that they have different
spatial distributions. It is deduced that there are two classes of 3.3 \mum
band carrier with a peak wavelength separation of ~0.02 \mum. From comparison
of the 3.3 \mum observations with laboratory and theoretical spectra for a
range of PAH molecules it is proposed that the 3.28 \mum and 3.30 \mum
components arise from 'bay' and 'non-bay' hydrogen sites, respectively, on the
periphery of small neutral PAHs. Observational data are also obtained for
L-band continuum emission and for the Pfund \epsilon hydrogen recombination
line.
