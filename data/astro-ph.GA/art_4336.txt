Gas signatures of Herbig Ae/Be disks probed with Herschel SPIRE
  spectroscopy
Herbig Ae/Be objects, like their lower mass counterparts T Tauri stars, are
seen to form a stable circumstellar disk which is initially gas-rich and could
ultimately form a planetary system. We present Herschel SPIRE 460-1540 GHz
spectra of five targets out of a sample of 13 young disk sources, showing line
detections mainly due to warm CO gas.
