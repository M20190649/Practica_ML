Refractive Convergent Plasma Lenses explain ESE and pulsar scintillation
We propose convergent plasma lenses, possibly from current sheets, as a
generic solution to strong interstellar scattering. These lenses resolve the
overpressure problem by geometric alignment as noted by Goldreich and Shridhar
(2006). They further quantitatively explain properties of extreme scattering
events, and pulsar parabolic arcs. This model makes quantitative predictions
testable by VLBI on scattering events. It differs conceptually from previous
models by occurring through rare, localized underdense sheets. Such sheets are
thermally and kinematically stable, and could be consequences of reconnection.
The apparent diffractive effects are a result of coherent interference of
refractive images. We propose that these lenses can be used for precision
distance determination to pulsars, enabling accurate gravity source
localization.
