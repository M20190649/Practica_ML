RAMSES-CH: A New Chemodynamical Code for Cosmological Simulations
We present a new chemodynamical code - Ramses-CH - for use in simulating the
self-consistent evolution of chemical and hydrodynamical properties of galaxies
within a fully cosmological framework. We build upon the adaptive mesh
refinement code Ramses, which includes a treatment of self-gravity,
hydrodynamics, star formation, radiative cooling, and supernovae feedback, to
trace the dominant isotopes of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe. We include the
contribution of Type Ia and II supernovae, in addition to low- and
intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, relaxing the instantaneous
recycling approximation. The new chemical evolution modules are highly flexible
and portable, lending themselves to ready exploration of variations in the
underpining stellar and nuclear physics. We apply Ramses-CH to the cosmological
simulation of a typical L* galaxy, demonstrating the successful recovery of the
basic empirical constraints regarding, [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] and Type Ia/II
supernovae rates.
