Notes on counter-orbiting globular clusters in the Milky Way
It is argued that Galactic globular clusters rotating retrograde may
originate from prograde globular clusters that change their angular momenturm
due to gravitational perturbations from the Magellanic Cloud galaxies. It is
shown that those galactic globular clusters with orbits near the Lagrangiane
point of the system "Milky Way - Maggellanic Clouds" can change the sign of
their angular momentum in few Gyr time scale.
