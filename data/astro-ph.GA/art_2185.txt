A hot molecular outflow driven by the ionized jet associated with IRAS
  16562-3959
We report molecular line observations in the CO J=3$\rightarrow$2,
6$\rightarrow$5 and 7$\rightarrow$6 transitions, made using the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment Telescope (APEX), toward the massive and dense core IRAS
16562$-$3959. This core harbors a string of radio sources thought to be powered
by a central collimated jet of ionized gas. The molecular observations show the
presence of high velocity gas exhibiting a quadrupolar morphology, most likely
produced by the presence of two collimated outflows. The southeast-northwest
molecular outflow is aligned with the string of radio continuum sources,
suggesting it is driven by the jet. We find that the excitation temperature of
the gas in the SE-NW outflow is high, with values of 145 and 120 K for the
blueshifted and redshifted lobes, respectively. This outflow has a total mass
of 1.92 \Msun, a total momentum of $\sim 89$ \Msun \kms and an averaged
momentum rate of $\sim 3.0\times10^{-2}$ \Msun \kms yr$^{-1}$, values
characteristics of flows driven by young massive stellar objects with high
luminosities ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 2\times10^4$ \Lsun). Complementary data taken
with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in high density and
shock tracers support the picture that IRAS 16562$-$3959 is an accreting young
massive star associated with an ionized jet, which is the energy source of a
molecular outflow.
