Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury IX: A Photometric Survey of
  Planetary Nebulae in M31
We search Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) broadband imaging data from the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey to identify detections of cataloged planetary
nebulae (PNe). Of the 711 PNe currently in the literature within the PHAT
footprint, we find 467 detected in the broadband. For these 467 we are able to
refine their astrometric accuracy from ~0."3 to 0."05. Using the resolution of
HST, we are able to show that 152 objects currently in the catalogs are
definitively not PNe, and we show that 32 objects thought to be extended in
ground-based images are actually point-like and therefore good PN candidates.
We also find one PN candidate that is marginally resolved. If this is a PN, it
is up to 0.7 pc in diameter. With our new photometric data, we develop a method
of measuring the level of excitation in individual PNe by comparing broadband
and narrowband imaging and describe the effects of excitation on a PN's
photometric signature. Using the photometric properties of the known PNe in the
PHAT catalogs, we search for more PN, but do not find any new candidates,
suggesting that ground-based emission-line surveys are complete in the PHAT
footprint to F475W $\simeq$ 24.
