An outflow perpendicular to the radio jet in the Seyfert nucleus of
  NGC5929
We report the observation of an outflow perpendicular to the radio jet in
near-infrared integral field spectra of the inner 250 pc of the Seyfert 2
galaxy NGC 5929. The observations were obtained with the Gemini Near infrared
Integral Field Spectrograph at a spatial resolution of ~20 pc and spectral
resolution R~5300 and reveal a region 50 pc wide crossing the nucleus and
extending by 300 pc perpendicularly to the known radio jet in this galaxy.
Along this structure - which we call SE-NW strip - the emission-line profiles
show two velocity components, one blueshifted and the other redshifted by -150
km/s and 150 km/s, respectively, relative to the systemic velocity. We
interpret these two components as due to an outflow perpendicular to the radio
jet, what is supported by low frequency radio emission observed along the same
region. We attribute this feature to the interaction of ambient gas with an
"equatorial outflow" predicted in recent accretion disk and torus wind models.
Perpendicularly to the SE-NW strip, thus approximately along the radio jet,
single component profiles show blueshifts of ~-150 km/s to the north-east and
similar redshifts to the south-west, which can be attributed to gas
counter-rotating relative to the stellar kinematics. More double-peaked
profiles are observed in association with the two radio hot-spots, attributed
to interaction of the radio jet with surrounding gas.
