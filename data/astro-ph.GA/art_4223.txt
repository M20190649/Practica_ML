Two estimates of the distance to the Galactic centre
We use recently updated globular cluster distances to estimate the distance
to the Galactic centre, finding 7.4 \pm 0.2|stat \pm 0.2|sys kpc from symmetry
considerations. We recalibrate the red clump magnitude from Hipparcos stars,
finding a skew distribution and a significant difference between peak and mean
magnitudes. We find an estimate from stars in the periphery of the bulge using
2MASS, R0 = 7.5 \pm 0.3 kpc, in agreement with the figure from the halo
centroid. We resolve discrepancies in the literature between estimates from the
red clump. Our results are consistent with those found by different
methodologies after taking systematic errors into account.
