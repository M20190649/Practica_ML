The Three Dimensional Properties and Energetics of Radio Jet Driven
  Outflows
Extended emission-line regions (EELRs), found around radio loud sources, are
likely outflows driven by one form of powerful AGN feedback mechanism. We seek
to constrain the three-dimensional gas properties and the outflow energetics of
the EELRs in this study. We used an integral field unit to observe EELRs around
two samples of of radio loud AGNs with similar radio properties but different
orientations: a sample of quasars and a sample of radio galaxies. A
morphological comparison suggests a scenario where the three-dimensional EELR
gas distribution follows rough biconical shapes with wide opening angles. The
average extent of the EELRs is $\sim 18.5$ kpc. The estimated average mass of
the EELRs, with reasonable assumptions for gas densities, is $\sim 3 \times
10^8$ M$_\odot$, and the average mass outflow rate is $\sim 30$ M$_\odot$/yr.
The EELRs around quasars and radio galaxies share similar kinematic properties.
Both samples have velocity structures that display a range of complexities and
they do not appear to correlate with the jet orientations, and both span a
similar range of velocity dispersions. Around 30\% of the detected EELRs show
large scale rotational motions, which may have originated from recent mergers
involving gas-rich disk galaxies.
