Forming misaligned stellar discs around a massive black hole: Cloud
  infall in the Galactic Centre
The innermost parsec around Sgr A* has been found to play host to two discs
or streamers of O and W-R stars. They are misaligned by an angle approaching 90
degrees. That the stars are approximately coeval indicates that they formed in
the same event rather than independently. We have performed SPH simulations of
the infall of a single prolate cloud towards a massive black hole. As the cloud
is disrupted, the large spread in angular momentum can, if conditions allow,
lead to the creation of misaligned gas discs. In turn, stars may form within
those discs. We are now investigating the origins of these clouds in the
Galactic Centre (GC) region.
