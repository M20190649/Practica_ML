What can we say about seed fields for galactic dynamos?
We demonstrate that a quasi-uniform cosmological seed field is a much less
suitable seed for a galactic dynamo than has often been believed. The age of
the Universe is insufficient for a conventional galactic dynamo to generate a
contemporary galactic magnetic field starting from such a seed, accepting
conventional estimates for physical quantities. We discuss modifications to the
scenario for the evolution of galactic magnetic fields implied by this result.
We also consider briefly the implications of a dynamo number that is
significantly larger than that given by conventional estimates.
