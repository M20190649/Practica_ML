Supernova-driven outflows and chemical evolution of dwarf spheroidal
  galaxies
We present a general phenomenological model for the metallicity distribution
(MD) in terms of [Fe/H] for dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). These galaxies
appear to have stopped accreting gas from the intergalactic medium and are
fossilized systems with their stars undergoing slow internal evolution. For a
wide variety of infall histories of unprocessed baryonic matter to feed star
formation, most of the observed MDs can be well described by our model. The key
requirement is that the fraction of the gas mass lost by supernova-driven
outflows is close to unity. This model also predicts a relationship between the
total stellar mass and the mean metallicity for dSphs in accord with properties
of their dark matter halos. The model further predicts as a natural consequence
that the abundance ratios [E/Fe] for elements such as O, Mg, and Si decrease
for stellar populations at the higher end of the [Fe/H] range in a dSph. We
show that for infall rates far below the net rate of gas loss to star formation
and outflows, the MD in our model is very sharply peaked at one [Fe/H] value,
similar to what is observed in most globular clusters. This suggests that
globular clusters may be end members of the same family as dSphs.
