A Herschel and BIMA study of the sequential star formation near the W48A
  HII region
We present the results of Herschel HOBYS photometric mapping combined with
BIMA observations and additional archival data, and perform an in-depth study
of the evolutionary phases of the star-forming clumps in W 48A and their
surroundings. Age estimates for the compact sources were derived from
bolometric luminosities and envelope masses, which were obtained from the dust
continuum emission, and agree within an order of magnitude with age estimates
from molecular line and radio data. The clumps in W 48A are linearly aligned by
age (east-old to west-young): we find a ultra compact (UC) HII region, a young
stellar object (YSO) with class II methanol maser emission, a YSO with a
massive outflow, and finally the NH_2D prestellar cores from Pillai et al. This
remarkable positioning reflects the (star) formation history of the region. We
find that it is unlikely that the star formation in the W 48A molecular cloud
was triggered by the UCHII region and discuss the Aquila supershell expansion
as a mayor influence on the evolution of W 48A. We conclude that the
combination of Herschel continuum data with interferometric molecular line and
radio continuum data is important to derive trustworthy age estimates and
interpret the origin of large scale structures through kinematic information.
