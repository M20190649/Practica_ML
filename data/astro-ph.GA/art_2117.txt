Unification of Radio Galaxies and Their Accretion/Jet Properties
We investigate the relation between black hole mass, M_bh, and jet power,
Q_jet, for a sample of BL Lacs and radio quasars. We find that BL Lacs are
separated from radio quasars by the FR I/II dividing line in M_bh-Q_jet plane,
which strongly supports the unification scheme of FR I/BL Lac and FR II/radio
quasar. The Eddington ratio distribution of BL Lacs and radio quasars exhibits
a bimodal nature with a rough division at L_bol/L_Edd~0.01, which imply that
they may have different accretion modes. We calculate the jet power extracted
from advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), and find that it require
dimensionless angular momentum of black hole j~0.9-0.99 to reproduce the
dividing line between FR I/II or BL Lac/radio quasar if dimensionless accretion
rate mdot=0.01 is adopted, which is required by above bimodal distribution of
Eddington ratios. Our results suggest that black holes in radio galaxies are
rapidly spinning.
