The Gentle Growth of Galaxies at High Redshifts in Overdense
  Environments
We have explored prevailing modes of galaxy growth for redshifts z ~ 6-14,
comparing substantially overdense and normal regions of the universe, using
high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations. Such rare overdense regions
have been projected to host high-z quasars. We demonstrate that galaxies in
such environments grow predominantly by a smooth accretion from cosmological
filaments which dominates the mass input from major, intermediate and minor
mergers. We find that by z ~6, the accumulated galaxy mass fraction from
mergers falls short by a factor of 10 of the cumulative accretion mass for
galaxies in the overdense regions, and by a factor of 5 in the normal
environments. Moreover, the rate of the stellar mass input from mergers also
lies below that of an in-situ star formation (SF) rate. The fraction of stellar
masses in galaxies contributed by mergers in overdense regions is ~12%, and
~33% in the normal regions, at these redshifts. Our median SF rates for ~few X
10^9 Mo galaxies agrees well with the recently estimated rates for z ~ 7
galaxies from Spitzer's SURF-UP survey. Finally, we find that the main
difference between the normal and overdense regions lies in the amplified
growth of massive galaxies in massive dark matter halos. This leads to the
formation of >= 10^{10} Mo galaxies due to the ~100-fold increase in mass
during the above time period. Such galaxies are basically absent in the normal
regions at these redshifts.
