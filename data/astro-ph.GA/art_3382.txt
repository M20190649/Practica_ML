The GALFA-HI Compact Cloud Catalog
We present a catalog of 1964 isolated, compact neutral hydrogen clouds from
the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array Survey Data Release One (GALFA-HI DR1).
The clouds were identified by a custom machine-vision algorithm utilizing
Difference of Gaussian kernels to search for clouds smaller than 20'. The
clouds have velocities typically between |VLSR| = 20-400 km/s, linewidths of
2.5-35 km/s, and column densities ranging from 1 - 35 x 10^18 cm^-2. The
distances to the clouds in this catalog may cover several orders of magnitude,
so the masses may range from less than a Solar mass for clouds within the
Galactic disc, to greater than 10^4 Solar Masses for HVCs at the tip of the
Magellanic Stream. To search for trends, we separate the catalog into five
populations based on position, velocity, and linewidth: high velocity clouds
(HVCs); galaxy candidates; cold low velocity clouds (LVCs); warm, low
positive-velocity clouds in the third Galactic Quadrant; and the remaining warm
LVCs. The observed HVCs are found to be associated with previously-identified
HVC complexes. We do not observe a large population of isolated clouds at high
velocities as some models predict. We see evidence for distinct histories at
low velocities in detecting populations of clouds corotating with the Galactic
disc and a set of clouds that is not corotating.
