Characterization of High Proper Motion Objects from the Wide-field
  Infrared Survey Explorer
We present an analysis of high proper motion objects that we have found in a
recent study and in this work with multi-epoch astrometry from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Using photometry and proper motions from 2MASS
and WISE, we have identified the members of this sample that are likely to be
late type, nearby, or metal poor. We have performed optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy on 41 objects, from which we measure spectral types that range
from M4-T2.5. This sample includes 11 blue L dwarfs and five subdwarfs; the
latter were also classified as such in the recent study by Kirkpatrick and
coworkers. Based on their spectral types and photometry, several of our
spectroscopic targets may have distances of <20 pc with the closest at ~12 pc.
The tangential velocities implied by the spectrophotometric distances and
proper motions indicate that four of the five subdwarfs are probably members of
the Galactic halo while several other objects, including the early-T dwarf WISE
J210529.08-623558.7, may belong to the thick disk.
