Fountain-driven gas accretion by the Milky Way
Accretion of fresh gas at a rate of ~ 1 M_{sun} yr^{-1} is necessary in
star-forming disc galaxies, such as the Milky Way, in order to sustain their
star-formation rates. In this work we present the results of a new hydrodynamic
simulation supporting the scenario in which the gas required for star formation
is drawn from the hot corona that surrounds the star-forming disc. In
particular, the cooling of this hot gas and its accretion on to the disc are
caused by the passage of cold galactic fountain clouds through the corona.
