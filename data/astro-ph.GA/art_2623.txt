The San Pedro MÃ¡rtir Kinematic Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae
The San Pedro M\'artir kinematic catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae
provides spatially resolved, long-slit Echelle spectra for about 600 planetary
nebulae. The data are presented wavelength calibrated and corrected for
heliocentric motion. For most objects multiple spectra have been acquired and
images with accurate slit positions on the nebulae are also presented for each
object. This is the most extensive and homogeneous single source of data
concerning the internal kinematics of the ionized nebular material in planetary
nebulae. Data can be retrieved for individual objects or selected by groups
that share some common characteristics, such as by morphological classes,
galactic population, binary cores, presence of fast outflows, etc. The
catalogue is available through the world wide web at
