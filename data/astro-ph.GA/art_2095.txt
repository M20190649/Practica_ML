On the formation of trapezium-like systems
We investigate the formation and evolution of high-order massive star
multiples similar to the Trapezium in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We perform
ensembles of N-body simulations of the evolution of N=1000 Orion-like clusters
with initial conditions ranging from cool and clumpy to relatively smooth and
relaxed. We find that trapezium-like systems are frequently formed in the first
2 Myr in initially cool and clumpy clusters and can survive for significant
amounts of time in such clusters. We also find that these systems are highly
dynamical entities, constantly interacting with the surrounding cluster,
changing their appearance and membership regularly. The eventual decay of
trapezium-like systems can even destroy the host cluster. We argue that the
current state of any trapezium-like system is transient and care should be
taken when analysing and drawing conclusions from a single snapshot in the life
of a highly dynamic object.
