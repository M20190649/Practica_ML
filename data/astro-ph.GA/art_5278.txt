Shapley Supercluster Survey (ShaSS): Galaxy Evolution from Filaments to
  Cluster Cores
We present an overview of a multi-wavelength survey of the Shapley
supercluster (SSC; z~0.05) covering a contiguous area of 260 h^-2_70 Mpc^2
including the supercluster core. The project main aim is to quantify the
influence of cluster-scale mass assembly on galaxy evolution in one of the most
massive structures in the local Universe. The Shapley supercluster survey
(ShaSS) includes nine Abell clusters (A3552, A3554, A3556, A3558, A3559, A3560,
A3562, AS0724, AS0726) and two poor clusters (SC1327- 312, SC1329-313) showing
evidence of cluster-cluster interactions. Optical (ugri) and near-infrared (K)
imaging acquired with VST and VISTA allow us to study the galaxy population
down to m*+6 at the supercluster redshift. A dedicated spectroscopic survey
with AAOmega on the Anglo-Australian Telescope provides a magnitude-limited
sample of supercluster members with 80% completeness at ~m*+3.
  We derive the galaxy density across the whole area, demonstrating that all
structures within this area are embedded in a single network of clusters,
groups and filaments. The stellar mass density in the core of the SSC is always
higher than 9E09 M_sun Mpc^-3, which is ~40x the cosmic stellar mass density
for galaxies in the local Universe. We find a new filamentary structure (~7 Mpc
long in projection) connecting the SSC core to the cluster A3559, as well as
previously unidentified density peaks. We perform a weak-lensing analysis of
the central 1 sqdeg field of the survey obtaining for the central cluster A3558
a mass of M_500=7.63E14 M_sun, in agreement with X-ray based estimates.
