SIGGMA: A Survey of Ionized Gas in the Galaxy, Made with the Arecibo
  Telescope
A Survey of Ionized Gas in the Galaxy, made with the Arecibo telescope
(SIGGMA) uses the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) to fully sample the Galactic
plane (30 < l < 75 and -2 < b < 2; 175 < l < 207 and -2 < b < 1) observable
with the telescope in radio recombination lines (RRLs). Processed data sets are
being produced in the form of data cubes of 2 degree (along l) x 4 degree
(along b) x 151 (number of channels), archived and made public. The 151
channels cover a velocity range of 600 km/s and the velocity resolution of the
survey changes from 4.2 km/s to 5.1 km/s from the lowest frequency channel to
the highest frequency channel, respectively.RRL maps with 3.4 arcmin resolution
and line flux density sensitivity of 0.5 mJy will enable us to identify new HII
regions, measure their electron temperatures, study the physics of
photodissociation regions (PDRs) with carbon RRLs, and investigate the origin
of the extended low density medium (ELDM). Twelve Hn{\alpha} lines fall within
the 300 MHz bandpass of ALFA; they are resampled to a common velocity
resolution to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SN) by a factor of 3 or more
and preserve the line width. SIGGMA will produce the most sensitive fully
sampled RRL survey to date. Here we discuss the observing and data reduction
techniques in detail. A test observation toward the HII region complex
S255/S257 has detected Hn{\alpha} and Cn{\alpha} lines with SN>10.
