The sino-german 6cm polarization survey of the galactic plane: A summary
We have finished the 6cm polarization survey of the Galactic plane using the
Urumqi 25m radio telescope. It covers 10deg<l<230deg in Galactic longitude and
|b| <5deg in Galactic latitude. The new polarization maps not only reveal new
properties of the diffuse magnetized interstellar medium, but also are very
useful for studying individual objects such as Hii regions, which may act as
Faraday screens with strong regular magnetic fields inside, and supernova
remnants for their polarization properties and spectra. The high sensitivity of
the survey enables us to discover two new SNRs G178.2-4.2 and G25.3-2.1 and a
number of Hii regions.
