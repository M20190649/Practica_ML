Detecting Triaxiality in the Galactic Dark Matter halo through Stellar
  Kinematics
Assuming the dark matter halo of the Milky Way as a non-spherical potential
(i.e. triaxial, prolate, oblate), we show how the assembling process of the
Milky Way halo, may have left long lasting stellar halo kinematic fossils only
due to the shape of the dark matter halo. In contrast with tidal streams,
associated with recent satellite accretion events, these stellar kinematic
groups will typically show inhomogeneous chemical and stellar population
properties. However, they may be dominated by a single accretion event for
certain mass assembling histories. If the detection of these peculiar kinematic
stellar groups is confirmed, they would be the smoking gun for the predicted
triaxiality of dark halos in cosmological galaxy formation scenarios.
