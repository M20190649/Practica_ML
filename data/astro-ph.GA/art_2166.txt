Star forming dwarf galaxies
Star forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) have a high gas content and low
metallicities, reminiscent of the basic entities in hierarchical galaxy
formation scenarios. In the young universe they probably also played a major
role in the cosmic reionization. Their abundant presence in the local volume
and their youthful character make them ideal objects for detailed studies of
the initial stellar mass function (IMF), fundamental star formation processes
and its feedback to the interstellar medium. Occasionally we witness SFDGs
involved in extreme starbursts, giving rise to strongly elevated production of
super star clusters and global superwinds, mechanisms yet to be explored in
more detail. SFDGs is the initial state of all dwarf galaxies and the relation
to the environment provides us with a key to how different types of dwarf
galaxies are emerging. In this review we will put the emphasis on the exotic
starburst phase, as it seems less important for present day galaxy evolution
but perhaps fundamental in the initial phase of galaxy formation.
