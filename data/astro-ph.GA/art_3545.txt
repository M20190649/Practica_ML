Ionization Source of a Minor-axis Cloud in the Outer Halo of M82
The M82 `cap' is a gas cloud at a projected radius of 11.6 kpc along the
minor axis of this well known superwind source. The cap has been detected in
optical line emission and X-ray emission and therefore provides an important
probe of the wind energetics. In order to investigate the ionization source of
the cap, we observed it with the Kyoto3DII Fabry-Perot instrument mounted on
the Subaru Telescope. Deep continuum, Ha, [NII]6583/Ha, and [SII]6716,6731/Ha
maps were obtained with sub-arcsecond resolution. The superior spatial
resolution compared to earlier studies reveals a number of bright Ha emitting
clouds within the cap. The emission line widths (< 100 km s^-1 FWHM) and line
ratios in the newly identified knots are most reasonably explained by slow to
moderate shocks velocities (v_shock = 40--80 km s^-1) driven by a fast wind
into dense clouds. The momentum input from the M82 nuclear starburst region is
enough to produce the observed shock. Consequently, earlier claims of
photoionization by the central starburst are ruled out because they cannot
explain the observed fluxes of the densest knots unless the UV escape fraction
is very high (f_esc > 60%), i.e., an order of magnitude higher than observed in
dwarf galaxies to date. Using these results, we discuss the evolutionary
history of the M82 superwind. Future UV/X-ray surveys are expected to confirm
that the temperature of the gas is consistent with our moderate shock model.
