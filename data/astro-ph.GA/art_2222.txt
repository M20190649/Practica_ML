Detection of interstellar hydrogen peroxide
The molecular species hydrogen peroxide, HOOH, is likely to be a key
ingredient in the oxygen and water chemistry in the interstellar medium. Our
aim with this investigation is to determine how abundant HOOH is in the cloud
core {\rho} Oph A. By observing several transitions of HOOH in the
(sub)millimeter regime we seek to identify the molecule and also to determine
the excitation conditions through a multilevel excitation analysis. We have
detected three spectral lines toward the SM1 position of {\rho} Oph A at
velocity-corrected frequencies that coincide very closely with those measured
from laboratory spectroscopy of HOOH. A fourth line was detected at the
4{\sigma} level. We also found through mapping observations that the HOOH
emission extends (about 0.05 pc) over the densest part of the {\rho} Oph A
cloud core. We derive an abundance of HOOH relative to that of H_2 in the SM1
core of about 1\times10^(-10). To our knowledge, this is the first reported
detection of HOOH in the interstellar medium.
