Distributions of molecules in the circumnuclear disk and surrounding
  starburst ring in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 observed with ALMA
Sensitive observations with ALMA allow astronomers to observe the detailed
distributions of molecules with relatively weak intensity in nearby galaxies.
In particular, we report distributions of several molecular transitions
including shock and dust related species ($^{13}$CO $J$ = 1--0, C$^{18}$O $J$ =
1--0, $^{13}$CN $N$ = 1--0, CS $J$ = 2--1, SO $J_N$ = 3$_2$--2$_1$, HNCO
$J_{Ka,Kc}$ = 5$_{0,5}$--4$_{0,4}$, HC$_3$N $J$ = 11--10, 12--11, CH$_3$OH
$J_K$ = 2$_K$--1$_K$, and CH$_3$CN $J_K$ = 6$_K$--5$_K$) in the nearby Seyfert
2 galaxy NGC 1068 observed with the ALMA early science program. The central
$\sim$1 arcmin ($\sim$4.3 kpc) of this galaxy was observed in the 100 GHz
region covering $\sim$96--100 GHz and $\sim$108--111 GHz with an angular
resolution of $\sim4"\times2"$ (290 pc$\times$140 pc) to study the effects of
an active galactic nucleus and its surrounding starburst ring on molecular
abundances. Here, we present images and report a classification of molecular
distributions into three main categories: (1) Molecules concentrated in the
circumnuclear disk (CND) (SO $J_N$ = 3$_2$--2$_1$, HC$_3$N $J$ = 11--10,
12--11, and CH$_3$CN $J_K$ = 6$_K$--5$_K$), (2) Molecules distributed both in
the CND and the starburst ring (CS $J$ = 2--1 and CH$_3$OH $J_K$ =
2$_K$--1$_K$), (3) Molecules distributed mainly in the starburst ring
($^{13}$CO $J$ = 1--0 and C$^{18}$O $J$ = 1--0). Since most of the molecules
such as HC$_3$N observed in the CND are easily dissociated by UV photons and
X-rays, our results indicate that these molecules must be effectively shielded.
In the starburst ring, the relative intensity of methanol at each clumpy region
is not consistent with those of $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and CS. This difference
is probably caused by the unique formation and destruction mechanisms of
CH$_3$OH.
