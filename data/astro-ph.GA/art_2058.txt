Massive stars in the Cl 1813-178 Cluster. An episode of massive star
  formation in the W33 complex
Young massive (M >10^4 Msun) stellar clusters are a good laboratory to study
the evolution of massive stars. Only a dozen of such clusters are known in the
Galaxy. Here we report about a new young massive stellar cluster in the Milky
Way. Near-infrared medium-resolution spectroscopy with UIST on the UKIRT
telescope and NIRSPEC on the Keck telescope, and X-ray observations with the
Chandra and XMM satellites, of the Cl 1813-178 cluster confirm a large number
of massive stars. We detected 1 red supergiant, 2 Wolf-Rayet stars, 1 candidate
luminous blue variable, 2 OIf, and 19 OB stars. Among the latter, twelve are
likely supergiants, four giants, and the faintest three dwarf stars. We
detected post-main sequence stars with masses between 25 and 100 Msun. A
population with age of 4-4.5 Myr and a mass of ~10000 Msun can reproduce such a
mixture of massive evolved stars. This massive stellar cluster is the first
detection of a cluster in the W33 complex. Six supernova remnants and several
other candidate clusters are found in the direction of the same complex.
