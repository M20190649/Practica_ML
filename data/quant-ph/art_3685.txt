Relativistic Aharonov-Casher Phase in Spin One
The Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is calculated in relativistic wave equations
of spin one. The AC phase has previously been calculated from the Dirac-Pauli
equation using a gauge-like technique \cite{MK1,MK2}. In the spin-one case, we
use Kemmer theory (a Dirac-like particle theory) to calculate the phase in a
similar manner. However the vector formalism, the Proca theory, is more widely
known and used. In the presence of an electromagnetic field, the two theories
are `equivalent' and may be transformed into one another. We adapt these
transformations to show that the Kemmer theory results apply to the Proca
theory. Then we calculate the Aharonov-Casher phase for spin-one particles
directly in the Proca formalism.
