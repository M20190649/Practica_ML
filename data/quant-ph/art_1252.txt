Squeezed States of a Particle in Magnetic Field
For a charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field, we construct
stationary squeezed states which are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian and the
non-Hermitian operator $\hat{X}_{\Phi} = \hat{X} \cos \Phi + \hat{Y} \sin
\Phi$, $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ being the coordinates of the Larmor circle
center and $\Phi$ is a complex parameter. In the family of the squeezed states,
the quantum uncertainty in the Larmor circle position is minimal. The wave
functions of the squeezed states in the coordinate representation are found and
their properties are discussed. Also, for arbitrary gauge of the vector
potential we derive the symmetry operators of translations and rotations.
