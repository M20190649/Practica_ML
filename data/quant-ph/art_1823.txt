Density Matrices and Geometric Phases for n-state Systems
An explicit parameterization is given for the density matrices for $n$-state
systems. The geometry of the space of pure and mixed states and the entropy of
the $n$-state system is discussed. Geometric phases can arise in only specific
subspaces of the space of all density matrices. The possibility of obtaining
nontrivial abelian and nonabelian geometric phases in these subspaces is
discussed.
