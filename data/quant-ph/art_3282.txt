Does Quantum Nonlocality Exist? Bell's Theorem and the Many-Worlds
  Interpretation
Quantum nonlocality may be an artifact of the assumption that observers obey
the laws of classical mechanics, while observed systems obey quantum mechanics.
I show that, at least in the case of Bell's Theorem, locality is restored if
observed and observer are both assumed to obey quantum mechanics, as in the
Many-Worlds Interpretation. Using the MWI, I shall show that the apparently
"non-local" expectation value for the product of the spins of two widely
separated particles --- the "quantum" part of Bell's Theorem --- is really due
to a series of three purely local measurements. Thus, experiments confirming
"nonlocality" are actually confirming the MWI.
