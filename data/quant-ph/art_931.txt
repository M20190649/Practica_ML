One-Dimensional Discrete Stark Hamiltonian and Resonance Scattering by
  Impurities
A one-dimensional discrete Stark Hamiltonian with a continuous electric field
is constructed by extension theory methods. In absence of the impurities the
model is proved to be exactly solvable, the spectrum is shown to be simple,
continuous, filling the real axis; the eigenfunctions, the resolvent and the
spectral measure are constructed explicitly. For this (unperturbed) system the
resonance spectrum is shown to be empty. The model considering impurity in a
single node is also constructed using the operator extension theory methods.
The spectral analysis is performed and the dispersion equation for the
resolvent singularities is obtained. The resonance spectrum is shown to contain
infinite discrete set of resonances. One-to-one correspondence of the
constructed Hamiltonian to some Lee-Friedrichs model is established.
