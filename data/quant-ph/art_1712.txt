Spatial Asymmetry For Particle Pairs And The Spin-Statistics Theorem
We discuss the conditions under which identical particles may yet be
distinguishable and the relationship between particle permutation and exchange.
We show that we can always define permutation-symmetric state vectors. When the
particles are completely indistinguishable, then exchange is equivalent to
permutation and therefore the exchange eigenvalue for such
permutation-symmetric state vectors is always +1. Exchange asymmetry arises
when the particles are physically distinguishable, even though otherwise
identical, and can be computed from the transformations that arise when the
distinguishing features are reversed.
  There is a fundamental spatial asymmetry between the relative orientations of
any two vectors in a common frame of reference that persists even in the limit
that the vectors coincide. For a pair of particles this asymmetry between their
spin quantization frames renders them distinguishable even when otherwise
identical. In the conventional construction, this distinction is not properly
accounted for. Particle exchange is then equivalent to reversing this relative
orientation --- which requires a relative rotation by 2pi on the spin
quantization frame of one particle with respect to the other, thus resulting in
the conventional exchange phase.
