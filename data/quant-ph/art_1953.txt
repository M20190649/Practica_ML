Optimal purification of single qubits
We introduce a new decomposition of the multiqubit states of the form
$\rho^{\otimes N}$ and employ it to construct the optimal single qubit
purification procedure. The same decomposition allows us to study optimal
quantum cloning and state estimation of mixed states.
