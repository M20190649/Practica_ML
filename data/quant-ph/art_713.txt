Quantum Computations and Images Recognition
The using of quantum parallelism is often connected with consideration of
quantum system with huge dimension of space of states. The n-qubit register can
be described by complex vector with 2^n components (it belongs to n'th tensor
power of qubit spaces). For example, for algorithm of factorization of numbers
by quantum computer n can be about a few hundreds for some realistic
applications for cryptography. The applications described further are used some
other properties of quantum systems and they do not demand such huge number of
states.
  The term "images recognition" is used here for some broad class of problems.
For example, we have a set of some objects V_i and function of "likelihood":
  F(V,W) < F(V,V) = 1
  If we have some "noisy" or "distorted" image W, we can say that recognition
of W is V_i, if F(W,V_i) is near 1 for some V_i.
