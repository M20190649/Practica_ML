Effective mass in quantum effects of radiation pressure
We study the quantum effects of radiation pressure in a high-finesse cavity
with a mirror coated on a mechanical resonator. We show that the optomechanical
coupling can be described by an effective susceptibility which takes into
account every acoustic modes of the resonator and their coupling to the light.
At low frequency this effective response is similar to a harmonic response with
an effective mass smaller than the total mass of the mirror. For a plano-convex
resonator the effective mass is related to the light spot size and becomes very
small for small optical waists, thus enhancing the quantum effects of
optomechanical coupling.
