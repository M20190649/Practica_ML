Measuring quantum state overlaps of traveling optical fields
We propose a detection scheme for measuring the overlap of the quantum state
of a weakly excited traveling-field mode with a desired reference quantum
state, by successive mixing the signal mode with modes prepared in coherent
states and performing photon-number measurements in an array of beam splitters.
To illustrate the scheme, we discuss the measurement of the quantum phase and
the detection of Schrodinger-cat-like states.
