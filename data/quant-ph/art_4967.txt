Limits to phase information in the parametric oscillator
Light in which the quantum fluctuations have been squeezed is often proposed
as a means of obtaining an improved phase reference compared to that available
from coherent light. Such a phase reference contains information about the
phase of the squeezed light, so it is important to calculate the limits to the
amount of ``phase information'' available. I define a phase resolution and show
how this scales as we increase the number of photons available when using
squeezed light generated by a parametric oscillator. Simple schemes for
creating squeezed coherent light using a beam-splitter and an interferometer
are analyzed, and it is shown that the results agree with earlier claims
[Kinsler] that when using squeezed coherent light as a phase reference, the
gain is not one of improved accuracy, but of lower power.
