Dynamical description of the buildup process in resonant tunneling:
  Evidence of exponential and non-exponential contributions
The buildup process of the probability density inside the quantum well of a
double-barrier resonant structure is studied by considering the analytic
solution of the time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the initial
condition of a cutoff plane wave. For one level systems at resonance condition
we show that the buildup of the probability density obeys a simple charging up
law, $| \Psi (\tau) / \phi | =1-e^{-\tau /\tau_0},$ where $\phi$ is the
stationary wave function and the transient time constant $\tau_0$ is exactly
two lifetimes. We illustrate that the above formula holds both for symmetrical
and asymmetrical potential profiles with typical parameters, and even for
incidence at different resonance energies. Theoretical evidence of a crossover
to non-exponential buildup is also discussed.
