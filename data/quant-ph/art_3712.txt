Coherent control using adaptive learning algorithms
We have constructed an automated learning apparatus to control quantum
systems. By directing intense shaped ultrafast laser pulses into a variety of
samples and using a measurement of the system as a feedback signal, we are able
to reshape the laser pulses to direct the system into a desired state. The
feedback signal is the input to an adaptive learning algorithm. This algorithm
programs a computer-controlled, acousto-optic modulator pulse shaper. The
learning algorithm generates new shaped laser pulses based on the success of
previous pulses in achieving a predetermined goal.
