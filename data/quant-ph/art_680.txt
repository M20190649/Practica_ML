Ideal Quantum Communication over Noisy Channels: a Quantum Optical
  Implementation
We consider transmission of an (unknown) quantum state between two distant
atoms via photons. Based on a quantum-optical realistic model, we define a
noisy quantum channel which includes systematic errors as well as errors due to
coupling to the environment. We present a protocol that allows one to
accomplish ideal transmission by repeating the transfer operation as many times
as needed.
