Popper's experiment and the Copenhagen interpretation
Popper conceived an experiment whose analysis led to a result that he deemed
absurd. Popper wrote that his reasoning was based on the Copenhagen
interpretation and therefore invalidated the latter. Actually, Popper's
argument involves counterfactual reasoning and violates Bohr's complementarity
principle. The absurdity of Popper's result only confirms Bohr's approach.
