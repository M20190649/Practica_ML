Quantum Cryptography Based on Orthogonal States
All existing quantum cryptosystems use non-orthogonal states as the carriers
of information. Non-orthogonal states cannot be cloned (duplicated) by an
eavesdropper. In result, any eavesdropping attempt must introduce errors in the
transmission, and therefore, can be detected by the legal users of the
communication channel. Orthogonal states are not used in quantum cryptography,
since they can be faithfully cloned without altering the transmitted data. In
this Letter we present a cryptographic scheme based on orthogonal states, which
also assures the detection of any eavesdropper.
