Universal property of the information entropy in atoms, nuclei and
  atomic clusters
The position- and momentum-space information entropies of the electron
distributions of atomic clusters are calculated using a Woods-Saxon single
particle potential. The same entropies are also calculated for nuclear
distributions according to the Skyrme parametrization of the nuclear mean
field. It turns out that a similar functional form S=a+b ln N for the entropy
as function of the number of particles N holds approximately for atoms, nuclei
and atomic clusters. It is conjectured that this is a universal property of a
many-fermion system in a mean field. It is also seen that there is an analogy
of our expression for S to Boltzmann's thermodynamic entropy S=k ln W.
