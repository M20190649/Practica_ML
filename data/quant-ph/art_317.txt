Error Prevention Scheme with Four Particles
It is shown that a simplified version of the error correction code recently
suggested by Shor exhibits manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect. Thus,
under certain conditions, protection of an unknown quantum state is achieved.
Error prevention procedures based on four-particle and two-particle encoding
are proposed and it is argued that they have feasible practical
implementations.
