Superluminal influences, hidden variables, and signaling
We consider alternative models to quantum mechanics, that have been proposed
in the recent years in order to explain the EPR correlations between two
particles. These models allow in principle local hidden variables produced at
the source, and some superluminal "hidden communication" (or "influences") to
reproduce the non-local correlations. Moving to the case of three particles, we
show that these alternative models lead to signaling when "hidden
communication" alone is considered as the origin of the correlations.
