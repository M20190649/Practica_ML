Quantum Logic for Trapped Atoms via Molecular Hyperfine Interactions
We study the deterministic entanglement of a pair of neutral atoms trapped in
an optical lattice by coupling to excited-state molecular hyperfine potentials.
Information can be encoded in the ground-state hyperfine levels and processed
by bringing atoms together pair-wise to perform quantum logical operations
through induced electric dipole-dipole interactions. The possibility of
executing both diagonal and exchange type entangling gates is demonstrated for
two three-level atoms and a figure of merit is derived for the fidelity of
entanglement. The fidelity for executing a CPHASE gate is calculated for two
87Rb atoms, including hyperfine structure and finite atomic localization. The
main source of decoherence is spontaneous emission, which can be minimized for
interaction times fast compared to the scattering rate and for sufficiently
separated atomic wavepackets. Additionally, coherent couplings to states
outside the logical basis can be constrained by the state dependent trapping
potential.
