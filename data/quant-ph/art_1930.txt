Impediments to mixing classical and quantum dynamics
The dynamics of systems composed of a classical sector plus a quantum sector
is studied. We show that, even in the simplest cases, (i) the existence of a
consistent canonical description for such mixed systems is incompatible with
very basic requirements related to the time evolution of the two sectors when
they are decoupled. (ii) The classical sector cannot inherit quantum
fluctuations from the quantum sector. And, (iii) a coupling among the two
sectors is incompatible with the requirement of physical positivity of the
theory, i.e., there would be positive observables with a non positive
expectation value.
