Entropic Bell Inequalities
We derive entropic Bell inequalities from considering entropy Venn diagrams.
These entropic inequalities, akin to the Braunstein-Caves inequalities, are
violated for a quantum mechanical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair, which implies
that the conditional entropies of Bell variables must be negative in this case.
This suggests that the satisfaction of entropic Bell inequalities is equivalent
to the non-negativity of conditional entropies as a necessary condition for
separability.
