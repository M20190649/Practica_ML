Bang-Bang Operations from a Geometric Perspective
Strong, fast pulses, called ``bang-bang'' controls can be used to eliminate
the effects of system-environment interactions. This method for preventing
errors in quantum information processors is treated here in a geometric setting
which leads to an intuitive perspective. Using this geometric description, we
clarify the notion of group symmetrization as an averaging technique, and
provide a geometric picture for evaluating errors due to imperfect bang-bang
controls. This will provide additional support for the usefulness of such
controls as a means for providing more reliable quantum information processing.
