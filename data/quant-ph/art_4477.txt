Communicating a direction using spin states
The communication of directions using quantum states is a useful laboratory
test for some basic facts of quantum information. For a system of spin-1/2
particles there are different quantum states that can encode directions. This
information can later be decoded by means of a generalized measurement. In this
talk we present the optimal strategies under different assumptions.
