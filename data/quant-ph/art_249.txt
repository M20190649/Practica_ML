Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory X: Quantization in Generalized
  Coordinates
In this tenth paper of the series we aim at showing that our formalism, using
the Wigner-Moyal Infinitesimal Transformation together with classical
mechanics, endows us with the ways to quantize a system in any coordinate
representation we wish. This result is necessary if one even think about making
general relativistic extensions of the quantum formalism. Besides, physics
shall not be dependent on the specific representation we use and this result is
necessary to make quantum theory consistent and complete.
