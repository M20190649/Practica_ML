Characterization of separable states and entanglement witnesses
We provide a canonical form of mixed states in bipartite quantum systems in
terms of a convex combination of a separable state and a, so-called, edge
state. We construct entanglement witnesses for all edge states. We present a
canonical form of nondecomposable entanglement witnesses and the corresponding
positive maps. We provide constructive methods for their optimization in a
finite number of steps. We present a characterization of separable states using
a special class of entanglement witnesses. Finally, we present a nontrivial
necessary condition for entanglement witnesses and positive maps to be
extremal.
