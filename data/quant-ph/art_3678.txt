Photon localization and vacuum noise in optical measurements
Description of detection and emission in terms of the photon localization is
discussed. It is shown that the standard representation of plane waves of
photons should be revised to take into consideration the boundary conditions
caused by the presence of quantum emitters and detectors. In turn, the change
of the boundary conditions causes spatially inhomogeneous structure of the
electromagnetic vacuum which leads to the increase of the vacuum noise over the
level predicted in the frame of the model of plane photons.
