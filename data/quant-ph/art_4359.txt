Jaynes-Cummings Model Dynamics in Two Trapped Ions
We showed that in Lamb-Dicke regime and under rotating wave approximation,
the dynamical behavior of two trapped ions interacting with a laser beam
resonant to the first red side-band of center-of-mass mode can be described by
Jaynes-Cummings Model. An exact analytic solution for this kind of
Jaynes-Cummings model is presented. The results showed that quantum collapses
and revivals for the occupation of two atoms, and squeezing for vibratic motion
of center-of-mass mode existed in both two different types of initial
conditions. The maximum momentum squeezing for center-of-mass mode in these two
types of conditions are found to be 42.4% and 43.8% respectively. The
coherence, in the first type of initial conditions can keeps long times, and in
the second type of initial conditions, a concrete form of coherent state is
obtained, when the initial average number is very small.
