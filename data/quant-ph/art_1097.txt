The quantum capacity is properly defined without encodings
We show that no source encoding is needed in the definition of the capacity
of a quantum channel for carrying quantum information. This allows us to use
the coherent information maximized over all sources and and block sizes, but
not encodings, to bound the quantum capacity. We perform an explicit
calculation of this maximum coherent information for the quantum erasure
channel and apply the bound in order find the erasure channel's capacity
without relying on an unproven assumption as in an earlier paper.
