Universal Quantum Information Compression
Suppose that a quantum source is known to have von Neumann entropy less than
or equal to S but is otherwise completely unspecified. We describe a method of
universal quantum data compression which will faithfully compress the quantum
information of any such source to S qubits per signal (in the limit of large
block lengths).
