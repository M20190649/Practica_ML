Local and Nonlocal Properties of Werner States
We consider a special kind of mixed states -- a {\it Werner derivative},
which is the state transformed by nonlocal unitary -- local or nonlocal --
operations from a Werner state. We show the followings. (i) The amount of
entanglement of Werner derivatives cannot exceed that of the original Werner
state. (ii) Although it is generally possible to increase the entanglement of a
single copy of a Werner derivative by LQCC, the maximal possible entanglement
cannot exceed the entanglement of the original Werner state. The extractable
entanglement of Werner derivatives is limited by the entanglement of the
original Werner state.
