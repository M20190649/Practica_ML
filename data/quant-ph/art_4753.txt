Probabilistic instantaneous quantum computation
The principle of teleportation can be used to perform a quantum computation
even before its quantum input is defined. The basic idea is to perform the
quantum computation at some earlier time with qubits which are part of an
entangled state. At a later time a generalized Bell state measurement is
performed jointly on the then defined actual input qubits and the rest of the
entangled state. This projects the output state onto the correct one with a
certain exponentially small probability. The sufficient conditions are found
under which the scheme is of benefit.
