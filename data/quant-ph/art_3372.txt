Preparation of GHZ states via Grover's quantum searching algorithm
In this paper we propose an approach to prepare GHZ states of an arbitrary
multi-particle system in terms of Grover's fast quantum searching algorithm.
  This approach can be regarded as an extension of the Grover's algorithm to
find one or more items in an unsorted database.
