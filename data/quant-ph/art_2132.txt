Quantum entanglement and classical communication through a depolarising
  channel
We analyse the role of entanglement for transmission of classical information
through a memoryless depolarising channel. Using the isotropic character of
this channel we prove analytically that the mutual information cannot be
increased by encoding classical bits into entangled states of two qubits.
