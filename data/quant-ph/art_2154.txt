On Quantum Algorithms
Quantum computers use the quantum interference of different computational
paths to enhance correct outcomes and suppress erroneous outcomes of
computations. In effect, they follow the same logical paradigm as
(multi-particle) interferometers. We show how most known quantum algorithms,
including quantum algorithms for factorising and counting, may be cast in this
manner. Quantum searching is described as inducing a desired relative phase
between two eigenvectors to yield constructive interference on the sought
elements and destructive interference on the remaining terms.
