Quantum Coordinates of an Event in Local Quantum Physics
Recently it has been proposed, using the formalism of
positive-operator-valued measures, a possible definition of quantum coordinates
for events in the context of quantum mechanics. In this short note we analyze
this definition from the point of view of local algebras in the framework of
local quantum theories.
