Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error
Recently Shor showed how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when
the error probability is logarithmically small. We improve this bound and
describe fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability is
smaller than some constant threshold. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and
space, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result
holds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To
achieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting
codes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that
satisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.
  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of
proper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The
second uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.
This class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum
particle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about
10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with
higher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical.
