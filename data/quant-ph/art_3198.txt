Strict Holism in a Quantum Superposition of Macroscopic States
We show that some N-particle quantum systems are holistic, such that the
system is deterministic, whereas its parts are random. The total correlation is
not sufficient to determine the probability distribution, showing a need for
extra measurements. We propose a formal definition of holism not based on
separability.
