Bound entanglement and continuous variables
We introduce the definition of generic bound entanglement for the case of
continuous variables. We provide some examples of bound entangled states for
that case, and discuss their physical sense in the context of quantum optics.
We rise the question of whether the entanglement of these states is generic. As
a byproduct we obtain a new many parameter family of bound entangled states
with positive partial transpose. We also point out that the ``entanglement
witnesses'' and positive maps revealing the corresponding bound entanglement
can be easily constructed.
