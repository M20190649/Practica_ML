Clock synchronization with dispersion cancellation
The dispersion cancellation feature of pulses which are entangled in
frequency is employed to synchronize clocks of distant parties. The proposed
protocol is insensitive to the pulse distortion caused by transit through a
dispersive medium. Since there is cancellation to all orders, also the effects
of slowly fluctuating dispersive media are compensated. The experimental setup
can be realized with currently available technology, at least for a proof of
principle.
