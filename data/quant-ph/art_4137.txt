Conditional generation of sub-Poissonian light from two-mode squeezed
  vacuum via balanced homodyne detection on idler mode
A simple scheme for conditional generation of nonclassical light with
sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics is proposed. The method utilizes
entanglement of signal and idler modes in two-mode squeezed vacuum state
generated in optical parametric amplifier. A quadrature component of the idler
mode is measured in balanced homodyne detector and only those experimental runs
where the absolute value of the measured quadrature is higher than certain
threshold are accepted. If the threshold is large enough then the conditional
output state of signal mode exhibits reduction of photon-number fluctuations
below the coherent-state level.
