Proposal for preparing delocalised mesoscopic states of material
  oscillators
A scheme is proposed for preparing delocalised mesoscopic states of the
motion of two or more atoms trapped at distantly-separated locations.
Generation of entanglement is achieved using interactions in cavity quantum
electrodynamics which facilitate motional quantum state transmission, via
light, between separate nodes of a quantum network. Possible applications of
the scheme are discussed.
