The Quantum State of an Ideal Propagating Laser Field
We give a quantum information-theoretic description of an ideal propagating
CW laser field and reinterpret typical quantum-optical experiments in light of
this. In particular we show that contrary to recent claims [T. Rudolph and B.
C. Sanders, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 077903 (2001)], a conventional laser can be
used for quantum teleportation with continuous variables and for generating
continuous-variable entanglement. Optical coherence is not required, but phase
coherence is. We also show that coherent states play a priveleged role in the
description of laser light.
