Quantum cloning without signaling
Perfect Quantum Cloning Machines (QCM) would allow to use quantum nonlocality
for arbitrary fast signaling. However perfect QCM cannot exist. We derive a
bound on the fidelity of QCM compatible with the no-signaling constraint. This
bound equals the fidelity of the Bu\v{z}ek-Hillery QCM.
