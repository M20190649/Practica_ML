Coherent control of spin squeezing
We report an interaction that controls spin squeezing in a collection of spin
1/2 particles. We describe how spin squeezing can be generated and maintained
in time. Our scheme can be applied to control the spin squeezing in a Bose
condensate with two internal spin states.
