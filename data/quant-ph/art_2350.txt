Non-Contextual Hidden Variables and Physical Measurements
For a hidden variable theory to be indistinguishable from quantum theory for
finite precision measurements, it is enough that its predictions agree for some
measurement within the range of precision. Meyer has recently pointed out that
the Kochen-Specker theorem, which demonstrates the impossibility of a
deterministic hidden variable description of ideal spin measurements on a spin
1 particle, can thus be effectively nullified if only finite precision
measurements are considered. We generalise this result: it is possible to
ascribe consistent outcomes to a dense subset of the set of projection valued
measurements, or to a dense subset of the set of positive operator valued
measurements, on any finite dimensional system. Hence no Kochen-Specker like
contradiction can rule out hidden variable theories indistinguishable from
quantum theory by finite precision measurements in either class.
