General Strategies for Discrimination of Quantum States
We derive general discrimination of quantum states chosen from a certain set,
given initial $M$ copies of each state, and obtain the matrix inequality, which
describe the bound between the maximum probability of correctly determining and
that of error. The former works are special cases of our results.
