A Generalization of Deutsch's Example
Quantum parallelism is the main feature of quantum computation. In 1985 D.
Deutsch showed that a single quantum computation may be sufficient to state
whether a two-valued function of a two-valued variable is constant or not.
Though the generalized problem with unconstrained domain and range size admits
no deterministic quantum solution, a fully probabilistic quantum algorithm is
presented in which quantum parallelism is harnessed to achieve a quicker
exploration of the domain with respect to the classical ``sampling'' strategy.
