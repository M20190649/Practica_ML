The temperature of the quantum vacuum
We propose that the quantum vacuum may be considered as a gas of virtual
photons which carry a non-vanishing linear momentum as well as a non-vanishing
energy. We study, in particular, the Casimir effect in order to show that these
virtual photons should satisfy a Fermi-Dirac statistics, which implies a
non-zero temperature of the vacuum state.
