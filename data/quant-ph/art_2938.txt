Quantum properties of classical Fisher information
The Fisher information of a quantum observable is shown to be proportional to
both (i) the difference of a quantum and a classical variance, thus providing a
measure of nonclassicality; and (ii) the rate of entropy increase under
Gaussian diffusion, thus providing a measure of robustness. The joint
nonclassicality of position and momentum observables is shown to be
complementary to their joint robustness in an exact sense.
