Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory XIV: Connection with Stochastic
  Processes
In this paper we are interested in unraveling the mathematical connections
between the stochastic derivation of Schr\"odinger equation and ours. It will
be shown that these connections are given by means of the time-energy
dispersion relation and will allow us to interpret this relation on more
sounded grounds. We also discuss the underlying epistemology.
