Barrier traversal times using a phenomenological track formation model
A phenomenological model for a measurement of barrier traversal times for
particles is proposed. Two idealized detectors for passage and arrival provide
entrance and exit times for the barrier traversal. The averaged traversal time
is computed over the ensemble of particles detected twice, before and after the
barrier. The Hartman effect can still be found when passage detectors that
conserve the momentum distribution of the incident packet are used.
