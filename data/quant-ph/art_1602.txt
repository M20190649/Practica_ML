"Interaction--free'' interaction: entangling evolution via quantum Zeno
  effect
The effect of entangling evolution induced by frequently repeated quantum
measurement is presented. The interesting possibility of conditional freezing
the system in maximally entangled state out of Zeno effect regime is also
revealed. The illustration of the phenomena in terms of dynamical version of
``interaction free'' measurement is presented. Some general conclusions are
provided.
