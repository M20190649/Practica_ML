Begging the Signalling Question: Quantum Signalling and the Dynamics of
  Multiparticle Systems
Many authors state that quantum nonlocality could not involve any
controllable superluminal transmission of momentum-energy, signals, or
information. We claim that most or all no-signalling proofs to date are
question-begging, in that they depend upon assumptions about the locality of
the measurement process that needed to be established in the first place. We
analyse no-signalling arguments by Bohm and Hiley, and Shimony, which
illustrate the problem in an especially striking way.
