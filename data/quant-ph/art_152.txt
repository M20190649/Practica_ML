The Revival Structure of Rydberg Wave Packets Beyond the Revival Time
After a Rydberg wave packet forms, it is known to undergo a series of
collapses and revivals within a time period called the revival time $t_{\rm
rev}$, at the end of which it resembles its original shape. We study the
behavior of Rydberg wave packets on time scales much greater than $t_{\rm
rev}$. We find that after a few revival cycles the wave packet ceases to reform
at multiples of the revival time. Instead, a new series of collapses and
revivals commences, culminating after a time period $t_{\rm sr} \gg t_{\rm
rev}$ with the formation of a wave packet that more closely resembles the
initial packet than does the full revival at time $t_{\rm rev}$. Furthermore,
at times that are rational fractions of $t_{\rm sr}$, we show that the motion
of the wave packet is periodic with periodicities that can be expressed as
fractions of the revival time $t_{\rm rev}$. These periodicities indicate a new
type of fractional revival, occurring for times much greater than $t_{\rm
rev}$. We also examine the effects of quantum defects and laser detunings on
the revival structure of Rydberg wave packets for alkali-metal atoms.
