Motion of a spin 1/2 particle in shape invariant scalar and magnetic
  fields
We study the motion of a spin 1/2 particle in a scalar as well as a magnetic
field within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics(SUSYQM). We also
introduce the concept of shape invariant scalar and magnetic fields and it is
shown that the problem admits exact analytical solutions when such fields are
considered.
