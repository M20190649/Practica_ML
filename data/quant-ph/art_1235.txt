Comments on Unruh's Paper
Unruh has commented upon my recent proof that certain predictions of quantum
theory are incompatible with the assertion that no influence of any kind acts
backward in time in any Lorentz frame. Unruh fails to make a necessary
distinction between statements that assert the existence of values, and
statements that assert the existence merely of correlations between possible
values. Consequently his argument fails to show that my proof involves a tacit
or hidden reality assumption that is alien to quantum theory.
