Quantum Teleportation Using Quantum Non-Demolition Technique
We propose a new scheme and protocol for quantum teleportation of a
single-mode field state, based on entanglement produced by quantum
non-demolition interaction. We show that the recently attained results in QND
technique allow to perform the teleportation in quantum regime. We also show
that applying QND coupling to squeezed fields will significantly improve the
quality of teleportation for a given degree of squeezing.
