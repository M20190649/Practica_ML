Analytic solutions to the problem of Coulomb and confining potentials
The oscillator representation method is presented and used to calculate the
energy spectra for a superposition of Coulomb and power-law potentials and for
Coulomb and Yukawa potentials. The method provides an efficient way to obtain
analytic results for arbitrary values of the parameters specifying the
above-type potentials. The calculated energies of the ground and excited states
of the quantum systems in question are found to comply well with exact results.
