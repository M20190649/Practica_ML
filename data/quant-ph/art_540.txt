Effects of Inelastic Scattering on Tunneling Time in Generalized
  Nelson's Quantum Mechanics
We analyze the effects of inelastic scattering on the tunneling time
theoretically, using generalized Nelson's quantum mechanics. This
generalization enables us to describe quantum system with optical potential and
channel couplings in a real time stochastic approach, which seems to give us a
new insight into quantum mechanics beyond Copenhagen interpretation.
