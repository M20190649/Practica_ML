Rules for Integrals over Products of Distributions from Coordinate
  Independence of Path Integrals
In perturbative calculations of quantum mechanical path integrals in
curvilinear coordinates, Feynman diagrams involve multiple temporal integrals
over products of distributions, which are mathematically undefined. We derive
simple rules for their evaluation from the requirement of coordinate
independence of path integrals.
