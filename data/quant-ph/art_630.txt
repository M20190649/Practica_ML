Capacities of Quantum Erasure Channels
The quantum analog of the classical erasure channel provides a simple example
of a channel whose asymptotic capacity for faithful transmission of intact
quantum states, with and without the assistance of a two-way classical side
channel, can be computed exactly. We derive the quantum and classical
capacities for the quantum erasure channel and related channels, and compare
them to the depolarizing channel, for which only upper and lower bounds on the
capacities are known.
