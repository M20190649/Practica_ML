Pseudo-Hermiticity of Hamiltonians under imaginary shift of the
  co-ordinate : real spectrum of complex potentials
We propose that the real spectrum and the orthogonality of the states for
several known complex potentials of both types, PT-symmetric and
non-PT-symmetric can be understood in terms of currently proposed
$\eta$-pseudo-Hermiticity (Mostafazadeh, quant-ph/0107001) of a Hamiltonian,
provided the Hermitian linear automorphism, $\eta$, is introduced as
$e^{-\theta p}$ which affects an imaginary shift of the co-ordinate :
$e^{-\theta p} x e^{\theta p} = x+i\theta$.
