Sensitivity to measurement perturbation of single atom dynamics in
  cavity QED
We consider continuous observation of the nonlinear dynamics of single atom
trapped in an optical cavity by a standing wave with intensity modulation. The
motion of the atom changes the phase of the field which is then monitored by
homodyne detection of the output field. We show that the conditional Hilbert
space dynamics of this system, subject to measurement induced perturbations,
depends strongly on whether the corresponding classical dynamics is regular or
chaotic. If the classical dynamics is chaotic the distribution of conditional
Hilbert space vectors corresponding to different observation records tends to
be orthogonal. This is a characteristic feature of hypersensitivity to
perturbation for quantum chaotic systems.
