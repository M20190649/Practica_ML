Experimental Realization of Teleporting an Unknown Pure Quantum State
  via Dual Classical and Einstein-Podolski-Rosen Channels
We report on a quantum optical experimental implementation of teleportation
of unknown pure quantum states. This realizes all the nonlocal aspects of the
original scheme proposed by Bennett et al. and is equivalent to it up to a
local operation. We exhibit results for the teleportation of a linearly
polarized state and of an elliptically polarized state. We show that the
experimental results cannot be explained in terms of a classical channel alone.
