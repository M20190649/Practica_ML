Aharonov-Bohm scattering of charged particles and neutral atoms: the
  role of absorption
The Aharonov-Bohm scattering of charged particles by the magnetic field of an
infinitely long and infinitely thin solenoid (magnetic string) in an absorbing
medium is studied. We discuss the partial-wave approach to this problem and
show that standard partial-wave method can be adjusted to this case. The effect
of absorption leads to oscillations of the AB cross section.
  Based on this we investigate the scattering of neutral atoms with induced
electric dipole moments by a charge wire of finite radius which is placed in an
uniform magnetic field. The physical realistic and practically important case
that all atoms which collide with the wire are totally absorbed at its surface,
is studied in detail. The dominating terms of the scattering amplitude are
evaluated analytically for different physical constellations. The rest terms
are written in a form suitable for a numerical computation. We show that if the
magnetic field is absent, the absorbing charged wire causes oscillations of the
cross section. In the presence of the magnetic field the cross section
increases and the dominating Aharonov--Bohm peak appears in the forward
direction, suppressing the oscillations.
