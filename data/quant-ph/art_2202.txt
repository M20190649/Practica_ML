Nondigital implementation of the arithmetic of real numbers by means of
  quantum computer media
In the framework of a model for quantum computer media, a nondigital
implementation of the arithmetic of the real numbers is described. For this
model, an elementary storage "cell" is an ensemble of qubits (quantum bits). It
is found that to store an arbitrary real number it is sufficient to use four of
these ensembles and the arithmetic operations can be implemented by fixed
quantum circuits.
