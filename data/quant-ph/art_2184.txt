Berry phase from a quantum Zeno effect
We exhibit a specific implementation of the creation of geometrical phase
through the state-space evolution generated by the dynamic quantum Zeno effect.
That is, a system is guided through a closed loop in Hilbert space by means a
sequence of closely spaced projections leading to a phase difference with
respect to the original state. Our goal is the proposal of a specific
experimental setup in which this phase could be created and observed. To this
end we study the case of neutron spin, examine the practical aspects of
realizing the "projections," and estimate the difference between the idealized
projections and the experimental implementation.
