Quantum fluctuations of the angular momentum and energy of the ground
  state
Quasiclassical solution of the three-dimensional Schredinger's equation is
given. The existence of nonzero minimal angular momentum M_0 = \hbar /2 is
shown, which corresponds to the quantum fluctuations of the angular momentum
and contributes to the energy of the ground state.
