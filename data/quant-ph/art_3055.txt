Quantum cryptography with 3-state systems
We consider quantum cryptographic schemes where the carriers of information
are 3-state particles. One protocol uses four mutually unbiased bases and
appears to provide better security than obtainable with 2-state carriers.
Another possible method allows quantum states to belong to more than one basis.
The security is not better, but many curious features arise.
