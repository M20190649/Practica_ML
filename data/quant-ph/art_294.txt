Quantum Interferometry: Some Basic Features Revisited
The reduction paradigm of quantum interferometry is reanalyzed. In contrast
to widespread opinion it is shown to be amenable to straightforward
mathematical treatment within ``every-users'' simple-minded single particle
quantum mechanics (without reduction postulate or the like), exploiting only
its probabilistic content.
