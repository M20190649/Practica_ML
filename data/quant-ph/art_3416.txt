Quantum Algorithm for Generalized Deutsch-Jozsa Problem
We generalize the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and present a quantum algorithm that
can solve the generalized Deutsch-Jozsa problem by a single evaluation of a
given function. We discuss the initialization of an auxiliary register and
present a generalized Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that requires no initialization
of an auxiliary register.
