Hardy-type experiment for the maximally entangled state: Illustrating
  the problem of subensemble postselection
By selecting a certain subensemble of joint detection events in a
two-particle interferometer arrangement, a formal nonlocality contradiction of
the Hardy type is derived for an ensemble of particle pairs configured in the
maximally entangled state. It is argued, however, that the class of experiments
exhibiting this kind of contradiction does not rule out the assumption of local
realism.
