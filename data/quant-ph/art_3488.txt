Einstein and Bell, von Mises and Kolmogorov: reality and locality,
  frequency and probability
We perform frequency analysis of the EPR-Bell argumentation. One of the main
consequences of our investigation is that the existence of probability
distributions of the Kolmogorov-type which was supposed by some authors is a
mathematical assumption which may not be supported by actual physical quantum
processes. In fact, frequencies for hidden variables for quantum particles and
measurement devices may fluctuate from run to run of an experiment. These
fluctuations of frequencies for micro-parameters need not contradict to the
stabilization of frequencies for physical observables. If, nevertheless,
micro-parameters are also statistically stable, then violations of Bell's
inequality and its generalizations may be a consequence of dependence of
collectives corresponding to two different measurement devices. Such a
dependence implies the violation of the factorization rule for the simultaneous
probability distribution. Formally this rule coincides with the well known BCHS
locality condition (or outcome independence condition). However, the frequency
approach implies totally different interpretation of dependence. It is not
dependence of events, but it is dependence of collectives. Such a dependence
may be induced by the same preparation procedure.
