Resonance energy-exchange-free detection and "welcher Weg" experiment
It is shown that a monolithic total-internal-reflection resonator can be used
for energy-exchange-free detections of objects without recoils. Related
energy-exchange-free detection of "welcher Weg" is discussed and an experiment
with an atom interferometer is proposed. The obtained results are in agreement
with quantum theory.
