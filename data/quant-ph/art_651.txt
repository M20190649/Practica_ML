Microtubules: The neuronic system of the neurons?
In this talk we review recent work on integrable models for Microtubule (MT)
networks, subneural paracrystalline cytosceletal structures, which seem to play
a fundamental role in the neurons. We cast here the complicated MT dynamics in
the form of a 1+1-dimensional non-critical string theory, which can be
formulated in terms of (dual) Dirichlet branes, according to modern
perspectives. We suggest that the MTs are the microsites in the brain, for the
emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the
``preconscious states''. Quantum space-time effects, as described by
non-critical string theory, trigger then an ``organized collapse'' of the
coherent states down to a specific or ``conscious state''. The whole process we
estimate to take O(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of
experimental/observational findings. The complete integrability of the stringy
model for MT proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory
coding and capacity. Such features might turn out to be important for a model
of the brain as a quantum computer.
