Nonclassical radiation from diamond nanocrystals
The quantum properties of the fluorescence light emitted by diamond
nanocrystals containing a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colored center is
investigated. We have observed photon antibunching with very low background
light. This system is therefore a very good candidate for the production of
single photon on demand. In addition, we have measured larger NV center
lifetime in nanocrystals than in the bulk, in good agreement with a simple
quantum electrodynamical model.
