Classical and quantum mechanics on information spaces with applications
  to cognitive, psychological, social and anomalous phenomena
We use the system of p-adic numbers for the description of information
processes. Basic objects of our models are so called transformers of
information, basic processes are information processes, the statistics are
information statistics (thus we present a model of information reality). The
classical and quantum mechanical formalisms on information p-adic spaces are
developed. It seems that classical and quantum mechanical models on p-adic
information spaces can be applied for the investigation of flows of information
in cognitive and social systems, since a p-adic metric gives quite natural
description of the ability to form associations.
