Spin Distributions for Bipartite Quantum Systems
We carryout a comparative study of spin distributions defined over the sphere
for bipartite quantum spin assemblies. We analyse Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm
(EPRB) spin correlations in a spin-s singlet state using these distributions.
We observe that in the classical limit EPRB spin distributions turn out to be
delta functions, thus reflecting the perfect anticorrelation property of two
spin vectors associated with a spin-s singlet state.
