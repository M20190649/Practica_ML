Incoherent dynamics in neutron-matter interaction
Coherent and incoherent neutron-matter interaction is studied inside a
recently introduced approach to subdynamics of a macrosystem. The equation
describing the interaction is of the Lindblad type and using the Fermi
pseudopotential we show that the commutator term is an optical potential
leading to well-known relations in neutron optics. The other terms, usually
ignored in optical descriptions and linked to the dynamic structure function of
the medium, give an incoherent contribution to the dynamics, which keeps
diffuse scattering and attenuation of the coherent beam into account, thus
warranting fulfilment of the optical theorem. The relevance of this analysis to
experiments in neutron interferometry is briefly discussed.
