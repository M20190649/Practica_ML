Casimir force at both non-zero temperature and finite conductivity
We find the joint effect of non-zero temperature and finite conductivity onto
the Casimir force between real metals. Configurations of two parallel plates
and a sphere (lens) above a plate are considered. Perturbation theory in two
parameters (the relative temperature and the relative penetration depth of zero
point oscillations into the metal) is developed. Perturbative results are
compared with computations. Recent evidence concerning possible existence of
large temperature corrections at small separations between the real metals is
not supported.
