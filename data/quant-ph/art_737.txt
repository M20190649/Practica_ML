Quantum controllers for quantum systems
This paper discusses fully coherent quantum feedback control, in which the
sensors, controller, and actuators are quantum systems and interact coherently
with the system to be controlled: as a result, the entire feedback loop is
coherent. Unlike conventional semiclassical feedback control of quantum
systems, feedback control by quantum controllers is not stochastic, preserves
the initial state of the controlled system, and can control quantum systems in
ways that are not possible using conventional, incoherent feedback control. In
particular, the target state to which the quantum controller drives the system
can be entangled with another quantum system. This paper investigates quantum
controllers and states necessary and sufficient conditions for a Hamiltonian
quantum system to be observable and controllable by a quantum controller.
