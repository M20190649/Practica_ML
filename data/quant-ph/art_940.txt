Strict Bounds on Franson Inequality
An inequality, recently proposed by Franson [Phys. Rev. A 54, 3808 (1996)] is
analyzed and improved. The inequality connects the change of the expectation
value of an observable with the uncertainty of this observable. A strict bound
on the ratio between these two quantities is obtained.
