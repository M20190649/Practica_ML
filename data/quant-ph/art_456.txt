Comment on ``Hidden quantum nonlocality revealed by local filters''
In Section 3 of his paper (N. Gisin, Phys. Lett. A 210 (1996) 151), Gisin
argues that a ``careless application of generalized quantum measurements can
violate Bell's inequality even for mixtures of product states.'' However, the
observed violation of the CHSH inequality is not in fact due to the application
of generalized quantum measurements, but rather to a misapplication of the
inequality itself -- to conditional expectations in which the conditioning
depends upon the measurements under consideration.
