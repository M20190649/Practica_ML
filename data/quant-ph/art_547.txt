Quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution among distant nodes
  in a quantum network
We propose a scheme to utilize photons for ideal quantum transmission between
atoms located at spatially-separated nodes of a quantum network. The
transmission protocol employs special laser pulses which excite an atom inside
an optical cavity at the sending node so that its state is mapped into a
time-symmetric photon wavepacket that will enter a cavity at the receiving node
and be absorbed by an atom there with unit probability. Implementation of our
scheme would enable reliable transfer or sharing of entanglement among
spatially distant atoms.
