Atomic scattering from Bose-Einstein condensates
Elastic scattering probes directly the interaction potential. For weakly
interacting condensates this potential is given by the condensate density. We
investigate how the differential and total cross sections reflect the density.
In particular, we have determined which signatures the Thomas Fermi
approximation leaves in contrast to an exact solution for the condensate wave
function within the Gross-Pitaevskii theory.
