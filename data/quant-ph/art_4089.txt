Toward the Quantum Design of Multichannel Systems (The Inverse Problem
  Approach)
The multichannel generalization of the theory of spectral, scattering and
decay control is presented. New universal algorithms of construction of complex
quantum systems with given properties are suggested. Particularly,
transformations of interaction matrices leading to the concentration of waves
in a chosen partial channel and spatial localization are shown. The limiting
instructive cases illustrating different phenomena which occur with the
combination of 'incompatible' properties are considered. For example, the
scattering solutions with different resonance widths at the same energy for the
same interaction are revealed. Analogously, a 'paradoxical' coexistence of both
strong reflection and absolute transparency is explained. The case of the
violation of 'natural' asymptotic behavior of partial wave function is
demonstrated : it has a greater damping decrement for the channel with a lower
threshold. Peculiarities of the multichannel periodic structures, bound states
embedded into continuum, resonance tunneling and degeneracy of states are
described.
