Quantum secret sharing
Secret sharing is a procedure for splitting a message into several parts so
that no subset of parts is sufficient to read the message, but the entire set
is. We show how this procedure can be implemented using GHZ states. In the
quantum case the presence of an eavesdropper will introduce errors so that his
presence can be detected. We also show how GHZ states can be used to split
quantum information into two parts so that both parts are necessary to
reconstruct the original qubit.
