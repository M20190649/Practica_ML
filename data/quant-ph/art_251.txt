Weak-Measurement Elements of Reality
A brief review of the attempts to define ``elements of reality'' in the
framework of quantum theory is presented. It is noted that most definitions of
elements of reality have in common the feature to be a definite outcome of some
measurement. Elements of reality are extended to pre- and post-selected systems
and to measurements which fulfill certain criteria of weakness of the coupling.
Some features of the newly introduced concepts are discussed.
