Optomechanical tailoring of quantum fluctuations
We propose the use of feedback mechanism to control the level of quantum
noise in a radiation field emerging from a pendular Fabry-Perot cavity. It is
based on the possibility to perform quantum nondemolition measurements by means
of optomechanical coupling.
