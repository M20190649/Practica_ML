Nonlocal looking equations can make nonlinear quantum dynamics local
A general method for extending a non-dissipative nonlinear Schr\"odinger and
Liouville-von Neumann 1-particle dynamics to an arbitrary number of particles
is described. It is shown at a general level that the dynamics so obtained is
completely separable, which is the strongest condition one can impose on
dynamics of composite systems. It requires that for all initial states
(entangled or not) a subsystem not only cannot be influenced by any action
undertaken by an observer in a separated system (strong separability), but
additionally that the self-consistency condition $Tr_2\circ
\phi^t_{1+2}=\phi^t_{1}\circ Tr_2$ is fulfilled. It is shown that a correct
extension to $N$ particles involves integro-differential equations which, in
spite of their nonlocal appearance, make the theory fully local. As a
consequence a much larger class of nonlinearities satisfying the complete
separability condition is allowed than has been assumed so far. In particular
all nonlinearities of the form $F(|\psi(x)|)$ are acceptable. This shows that
the locality condition does not single out logarithmic or 1-homeogeneous
nonlinearities.
