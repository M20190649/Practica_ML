Quantum state engineering using conditional measurement on a beam
  splitter
State preparation via conditional output measurement on a beam splitter is
studied, assuming the signal mode is mixed with a mode prepared in a Fock state
and photon numbers are measured in one of the output channels. It is shown that
the mode in the other output channel is prepared in either a photon-subtracted
or a photon-added Jacobi polynomial state, depending upon the difference
between the number of photons in the input Fock state and the number of photons
in the output Fock state onto which it is projected. The properties of the
conditional output states are studied for coherent and squeezed input states,
and the probabilities of generating the states are calculated. Relations to
other states, such as near-photon-number states and squeezed-state-excitations,
are given and proposals are made for generating them by combining the scheme
with others. Finally, effects of realistic photocounting and Fock-state
preparation are discussed.
