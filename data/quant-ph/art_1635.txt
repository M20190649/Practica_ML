A quantum algorithm providing exponential speed increase for finding
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors
We describe a new polynomial time quantum algorithm that uses the quantum
fast fourier transform to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian
operator, and that can be applied in cases (commonly found in ab initio physics
and chemistry problems) for which all known classical algorithms require
exponential time. Applications of the algorithm to specific problems are
considered, and we find that classically intractable and interesting problems
from atomic physics may be solved with between 50 and 100 quantum bits.
