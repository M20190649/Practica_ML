Macroscopic Interference Effects in Resonant Cavities
We investigate the possibility of interference effects induced by macroscopic
quantum-mechanical superpositions of almost othogonal coherent states - a
Schroedinger cats state - in a resonant microcavity. Despite the fact that a
single atom, used as a probe of the cat state, on the average only change the
mean number of photons by one unit, we show that this single atom can change
the system drastically. Interference between the initial and almost orthogonal
macroscopic quantum states of the radiation field can now take place.
Dissipation under current experimental conditions is taken into account and it
is found that this does not necessarily change the intereference effects
dramatically.
