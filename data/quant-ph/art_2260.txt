Efficient implementation of selective recoupling in heteronuclear spin
  systems using Hadamard matrices
We present an efficient scheme which couples any designated pair of spins in
heteronuclear spin systems. The scheme is based on the existence of Hadamard
matrices. For a system of $n$ spins with pairwise coupling, the scheme
concatenates $cn$ intervals of system evolution and uses at most $c n^2$ pulses
where $c \approx 1$. Our results demonstrate that, in many systems, selective
recoupling is possible with linear overhead, contrary to common speculation
that exponential effort is always required.
