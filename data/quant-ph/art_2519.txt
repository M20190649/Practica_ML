Coding Theorems of Quantum Information Theory
Coding theorems and (strong) converses for memoryless quantum communication
channels and quantum sources are proved: for the quantum source the coding
theorem is reviewed, and the strong converse proven. For classical information
transmission via quantum channels we give a new proof of the coding theorem,
and prove the strong converse, even under the extended model of nonstationary
channels. As a by-product we obtain a new proof of the famous Holevo bound.
Then multi-user systems are investigated, and the capacity region for the
quantum multiple access channel is determined. The last chapter contains a
preliminary discussion of some models of compression of correlated quantum
sources, and a proposal for a program to obtain operational meaning for quantum
conditional entropy. An appendix features the introduction of a notation and
calculus of entropy in quantum systems.
