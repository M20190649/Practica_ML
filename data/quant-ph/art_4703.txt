Conservation of Orbital Angular Momentum in Stimulated Down-Conversion
We report on an experiment demonstrating the conservation of orbital angular
momentum in stimulated down-conversion. The orbital angular momentum is not
transferred to the individual beams of the spontaneous down-conversion, but it
is conserved when twin photons are taken individually. We observe the
conservation law for an individual beam of the down-conversion through
cavity-free stimulated emission.
