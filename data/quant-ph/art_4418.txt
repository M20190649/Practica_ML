On the Existence of the Quantum Action
We have previously proposed a conjecture stating that quantum mechanical
transition amplitudes can be parametrized in terms of a quantum action. Here we
give a proof of the conjecture and establish the existance of a local quantum
action in the case of imaginary time in the Feynman-Kac limit (when temperature
goes to zero). Moreover we discuss some symmetry properties of the quantum
action.
