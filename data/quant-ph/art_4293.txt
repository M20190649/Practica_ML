How many photons are needed to distinguish two transparencies?
We give a bound on the minimum number of photons that must be absorbed by any
quantum protocol to distinguish between two transparencies. We show how a
quantum Zeno method in which the angle of rotation is varied at each iteration
can attain this bound in certain situations.
