Wavelets and Wavelet Packets on Quantum Computers
We show how periodized wavelet packet transforms and periodized wavelet
transforms can be implemented on a quantum computer. Surprisingly, we find that
the implementation of wavelet packet transforms is less costly than the
implementation of wavelet transforms on a quantum computer.
