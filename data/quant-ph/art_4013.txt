Single-particle nonlocality and entanglement with the vacuum
We propose a single-particle experiment that is equivalent to the
conventional two-particle experiment used to demonstrate a violation of Bell's
inequalities. Hence, we argue that quantum mechanical nonlocality can be
demonstrated by single-particle states. The validity of such a claim has been
discussed in the literature, but without reaching a clear consensus. We show
that the disagreement can be traced to what part of the total state of the
experiment one assigns to the (macroscopic) measurement apparatus. However,
with a conventional and legitimate interpretation of the measurement process
one is led to the conclusion that even a single particle can show nonlocal
properties.
