The Zeno and anti-Zeno effects on decay in dissipative quantum systems
We point out that the quantum Zeno effect, i.e., inhibition of spontaneous
decay by frequent measurements, is observable only in spectrally finite
reservoirs, i.e., in cavities and waveguides, using a sequence of
evolution-interrupting pulses or randomly-modulated CW fields. By contrast,
such measurements can only accelerate decay in free space.
