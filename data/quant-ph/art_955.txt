Quantum Entanglement and the Communication Complexity of the Inner
  Product Function
We consider the communication complexity of the binary inner product function
in a variation of the two-party scenario where the parties have an a priori
supply of particles in an entangled quantum state. We prove linear lower bounds
for both exact protocols, as well as for protocols that determine the answer
with bounded-error probability. Our proofs employ a novel kind of "quantum"
reduction from a quantum information theory problem to the problem of computing
the inner product. The communication required for the former problem can then
be bounded by an application of Holevo's theorem. We also give a specific
example of a probabilistic scenario where entanglement reduces the
communication complexity of the inner product function by one bit.
