Proposal for teleportation of the wave function of a massive particle
We propose a scheme for teleporting an atomic center-of-mass wave function
between distant locations. The scheme uses interactions in cavity quantum
electrodynamics to facilitate a coupling between the motion of an atom trapped
inside a cavity and external propagating light fields. This enables the
distribution of quantum entanglement and the realization of the required
motional Bell-state analysis.
