Individual addressing and state readout of trapped ions utilizing rf-
  micromotion
A new scheme for the individual addressing of ions in a trap is described
that does not rely on light beams tightly focused onto only one ion. The scheme
utilizes ion micromotion that may be induced in a linear trap by dc offset
potentials. Thus coupling an individual ion to the globally applied light
fields corresponds to a mere switching of voltages on a suitable set of
compensation electrodes. The proposed scheme is especially suitable for
miniaturized rf (Paul) traps with typical dimensions of about 20-40 microns.
