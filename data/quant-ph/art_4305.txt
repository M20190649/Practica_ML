Mesoscopic interference
We analyze a double-slit experiment when the interfering particle is
"mesoscopic" and one endeavors to obtain Welcher Weg information by shining
light on it. We derive a compact expression for the visibility of the
interference pattern: coherence depends on both the spatial and temporal
features of the wave function during its travel to the screen. We set a bound
on the temperature of the mesoscopic particle in order that its quantum
mechanical coherence be maintained.
