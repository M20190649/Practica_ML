Description of isolated macroscopic systems inside quantum mechanics
For an isolated macrosystem classical state parameters $\zeta(t)$ are
introduced inside a quantum mechanical treatment. By a suitable mathematical
representation of the actual preparation procedure in the time interval
$[T,t_0]$ a statistical operator is constructed as a solution of the Liouville
von Neumann equation, exhibiting at time $t$ the state parameters $\zeta(t')$,
$t_0\leq t' \leq t$, and {\it preparation parameters} related to times $T \leq
t'\leq t_0$. Relation with Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator is
discussed. A mechanism for memory loss is investigated and time evolution by a
semigroup is obtained for a restricted set of relevant observables, slowly
varying on a suitable time scale.
