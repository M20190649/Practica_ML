Quantum Cooperative Games
We study two forms of a symmetric cooperative game played by three players,
one classical and other quantum. In its classical form making a coalition gives
advantage to players and they are motivated to do so. However in its quantum
form the advantage is lost and players are left with no motivation to make a
coalition.
