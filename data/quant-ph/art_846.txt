Quantum Robots and Quantum Computers
Validation of a presumably universal theory, such as quantum mechanics,
requires a quantum mechanical description of systems that carry out theoretical
calculations and experiments. The description of quantum computers is under
active development. No description of systems to carry out experiments has been
given. A small step in this direction is taken here by giving a description of
quantum robots as mobile systems with on board quantum computers that interact
with environments. Some properties of these systems are discussed. A specific
model based on the literature descriptions of quantum Turing machines is
presented.
