Nonclassical correlations in damped quantum solitons
Using cumulant expansion in Gaussian approximation, the internal quantum
statistics of damped soliton-like pulses in Kerr media are studied numerically,
considering both narrow and finite bandwidth spectral pulse components. It is
shown that the sub-Poissonian statistics can be enhanced, under certain
circumstances, by absorption, which damps out some destructive interferences.
Further, it is shown that both the photon-number correlation and the
correlation of the photon-number variance between different pulse components
can be highly nonclassical even for an absorbing fiber. Optimum frequency
windows are determined in order to realize strong nonclassical behavior, which
offers novel possibilities of using solitons in optical fibers as a source of
nonclassically correlated light beams.
