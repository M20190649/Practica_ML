Entangling Atoms and Ions in Dissipative Environments
Quantum information processing rests on our ability to manipulate quantum
superpositions through coherent unitary transformations, and to establish
entanglement between constituent quantum components of the processor. The
quantum information processor (a linear ion trap, or a cavity confining the
radiation field for example) exists in a dissipative environment. We discuss
ways in which entanglement can be established within such dissipative
environments. We can even make use of a strong interaction of the system with
its environment to produce entanglement in a controlled way.
