Toward a finite-dimensional formulation of Quantum Field Theory
Rules of quantization and equations of motion for a finite-dimensional
formulation of Quantum Field Theory are proposed which fulfill the following
properties: a) both the rules of quantization and the equations of motion are
covariant; b) the equations of evolution are second order in derivatives and
first order in derivatives of the space-time co-ordinates; and c) these rules
of quantization and equations of motion lead to the usual (canonical) rules of
quantization and the (Schr\"odinger) equation of motion of Quantum Mechanics in
the particular case of mechanical systems. We also comment briefly on further
steps to fully develop a satisfactory quantum field theory and the difficuties
which may be encountered when doing so.
