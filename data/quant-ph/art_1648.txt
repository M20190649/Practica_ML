On the Absence of the Zeno Effect in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory
We study the time evolution of decaying particles in renormalizable models of
Relativistic Quantum Field Theory. Significant differences between the latter
and Non Relativistic Quantum Mechanics are found -in particular, the Zeno
effect seems to be absent in such RQFT models. Conventional renormalization
yields finite time behavior in some cases but fails to produce finite survival
probabilities in others.
