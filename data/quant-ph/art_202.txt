On the Flux-Across-Surfaces Theorem
The quantum probability flux of a particle integrated over time and a distant
surface gives the probability for the particle crossing that surface at some
time. We prove the free Flux-Across-Surfaces Theorem, which was conjectured by
Combes, Newton and Shtokhamer, and which relates the integrated quantum flux to
the usual quantum mechanical formula for the cross section. The integrated
quantum flux is equal to the probability of outward crossings of surfaces by
Bohmian trajectories in the scattering regime.
