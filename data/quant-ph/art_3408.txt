Transient interference of transmission and incidence
Due to a transient quantum interference during a wavepacket collision with a
potential barrier, a particular momentum, that depends on the potential
parameters but is close to the initial average momentum, becomes suppressed.
The hole left pushes the momentum distribution outwards leading to a
significant constructive enhancement of lower and higher momenta. This is
explained in the momentum complex-plane language in terms of a saddle point and
two contiguous ``structural'' poles, which are not associated with resonances
but with incident and transmitted components of the wavefunction.
