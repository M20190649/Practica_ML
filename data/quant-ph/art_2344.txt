Geometric phases for generalized squeezed coherent states
A simple technique is used to obtain a general formula for the Berry phase
(and the corresponding Hannay angle) for an arbitrary Hamiltonian with an
equally-spaced spectrum and appropriate ladder operators connecting the
eigenstates. The formalism is first applied to a general deformation of the
oscillator involving both squeezing and displacement. Earlier results are shown
to emerge as special cases. The analysis is then extended to multiphoton
squeezed coherent states and the corresponding anholonomies deduced.
