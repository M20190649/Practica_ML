Quantum Error Correction and Reversible Operations
I give a pedagogical account of Shor's nine-bit code for correcting arbitrary
errors on single qubits, and I review work that determines when it is possible
to maintain quantum coherence by reversing the deleterious effects of
open-system quantum dynamics. The review provides an opportunity to introduce
an efficient formalism for handling superoperators. I present and prove some
bounds on entanglement fidelity, which might prove useful in analyses of
approximate error correction.
