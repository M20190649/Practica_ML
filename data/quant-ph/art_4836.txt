From Coupled Pendulums to Quantum Search
Quantum search is a quantum mechanical technique for searching N
possibilities in only sqrt(N) steps. This paper gives a fresh perspective on
the algorithm in terms of a resonance phenomenon which is implemented through
classical coupled oscillators. Consider N oscillators, one of which is of a
different resonant frequency. We could identify which one this is by measuring
the oscillation frequency of each oscillator, a procedure that would take about
N cycles. We show how, by coupling the oscillators together in a very simple
way, it is possible to identify the different one in only sqrt(N) cycles. An
extension of this technique to the quantum case leads to the quantum search
algorithm.
