Quantum Computers and Dissipation
We analyse dissipation in quantum computation and its destructive impact on
efficiency of quantum algorithms. Using a general model of decoherence, we
study the time evolution of a quantum register of arbitrary length coupled with
an environment of arbitrary coherence length. We discuss relations between
decoherence and computational complexity and show that the quantum
factorization algorithm must be modified in order to be regarded as efficient
and realistic.
