Three-particle GHZ correlations without nonlocality
The formalism employing local complex amplitudes that resolved the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen puzzle (C. S. Unnikrishnan, quant-ph/0001112) is
applied to the three-particle GHZ correlations. We show that the GHZ quantum
correlations can be reproduced without nonlocality.
