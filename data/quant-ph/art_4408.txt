On entanglement-assisted classical capacity
This paper is essentially a lecture from the author's course on quantum
information theory, which is devoted to the result of C. H. Bennett, P. W.
Shor, J. A. Smolin and A. V. Thapliyal (quant-ph/0106052) concerning
entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel. A modified proof
of this result is given and relation between entanglement-assisted and
unassisted classical capacities is discussed.
