Resonances from Higher Order S-Matrix Poles with Exponential Decay
In analogy to Gamow vectors describing resonance states from first order
S-matrix poles, one can define Gamow vectors from higher order poles of the
S-matrix. With these vectors we are going to discuss a density operator that
describes exponentially decaying resonances from higher order poles.
