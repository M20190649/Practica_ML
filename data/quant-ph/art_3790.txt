Infrared generation in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures
  via quantum coherence
A new scheme for infrared generation without population inversion between
subbands in quantum-well and quantum-dot lasers is presented and documented by
detailed calculations. The scheme is based on the simultaneous generation at
three frequencies: optical lasing at the two interband transitions which take
place simultaneously, in the same active region, and serve as the coherent
drive for the IR field. This mechanism for frequency down-conversion does not
rely upon any ad hoc assumptions of long-lived coherences in the semiconductor
active medium. And it should work efficiently at room temperature with
injection current pumping. For optimized waveguide and cavity parameters, the
intrinsic efficiency of the down-conversion process can reach the limiting
quantum value corresponding to one infrared photon per one optical photon. Due
to the parametric nature of IR generation, the proposed inversionless scheme is
especially promising for long-wavelength (far- infrared) operation.
