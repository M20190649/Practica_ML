Algorithmic Cooling and Scalable NMR Quantum Computers
We present here algorithmic cooling (via polarization-heat-bath)- a powerful
method for obtaining a large number of highly polarized spins in liquid
nuclear-spin systems at finite temperature. Given that spin-half states
represent (quantum) bits, algorithmic cooling cleans dirty bits beyond the
Shannon's bound on data compression, by employing a set of rapidly
thermal-relaxing bits. Such auxiliary bits could be implemented using spins
that rapidly get into thermal equilibrium with the environment, e.g., electron
spins.
  Cooling spins to a very low temperature without cooling the environment could
lead to a breakthrough in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and our
``spin-refrigerating'' method suggests that this is possible.
  The scaling of NMR ensemble computers is probably the main obstacle to
building useful quantum computing devices, and our spin-refrigerating method
suggests that this problem can be resolved.
