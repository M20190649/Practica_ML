New Trends in Quantum Computing
Classical and quantum information are very different. Together they can
perform feats that neither could achieve alone, such as quantum computing,
quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Some of the applications range
from helping to preventing spies from reading private communications. Among the
tools that will facilitate their implementation, we note quantum purification
and quantum error correction. Although some of these ideas are still beyond the
grasp of current technology, quantum cryptography has been implemented and the
prospects are encouraging for small-scale prototypes of quantum computation
devices before the end of the millennium.
