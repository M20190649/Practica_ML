A search for a border between classical and quantum worlds
The effects of environmental decoherence on a mass center position of a
macroscopic body are studied using the linear quantum Boltzmann equation. The
border between the classical world and the quantum one is discussed and the
results are illustrated by the recent experiments od Zeilinger group involving
C_60 and C_70 fullerenes.
