Analytical properties of scattering amplitudes in one-dimensional
  quantum theory
One-dimensional quantum scattering from a local potential barrier is
considered. Analytical properties of the scattering amplitudes have been
investigated by means of the integral equations equivalent to the Schrodinger
equations. The transition and reflection amplitudes are expressed in terms of
two complex functions of the incident energy, which are similar to the Jost
function in the partial-wave scattering. These functions are entire for
finite-range potentials and meromorphic for exponentially decreasing
potentials. The analytical properties result from locality of the potential in
the wave equation and represent the effect of causality in time dependence of
the scattering process.
