Expanding Hermitean Operators in a Basis of Projectors on Coherent Spin
  States
The expectation values of a hermitean operator A in (2s+1)(2s+1) specific
coherent states of a spin are known to determine the operator unambiguously. As
shown here, (almost) any other (2s+1)(2s+1) coherent states also provide a
basis for self-adjoint operators. This is proven by considering the determinant
of the Gram matrix associated with the coherent state projectors as a
Hamiltonian of a fictitious classical spin system.
