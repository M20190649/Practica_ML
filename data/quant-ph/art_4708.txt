Perspectives on a Solid State NMR Quantum Computer
A quantum information processing device, based on bulk solid state NMR of the
quasi-one dimensional material hydroxyapatite, is proposed following the
magnetic resonance force microscopy work of Yamamoto et al (quant-ph/0009122).
In a macroscopic sample of hydroxyapatite, our solid state NMR model yields a
limit of 10^8 qubits imposed by physics, while development of current
technological considerations should allow an upper bound in the range of
hundreds to thousands of qubits.
