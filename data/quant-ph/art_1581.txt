Algorithmic randomness, physical entropy, measurements, and the Demon of
  Choice
Measurements --- interactions which establish correlations between a system
and a recording device --- can be made thermodynamically reversible. One might
be concerned that such reversibility will make the second law of thermodynamics
vulnerable to the designs of the demon of choice, a selective version of
Maxwell's demon. The strategy of the demon of choice is to take advantage of
rare fluctuations to extract useful work, and to reversibly undo measurements
which do not lead to such a favorable but unlikely outcomes. I show that this
threat does not arise as the demon of choice cannot operate without recording
(explicitely or implicitely) whether its measurement was a success (or a
failure). Thermodynamic cost associated with such a record cannot be, on the
average, made smaller than the gain of useful work derived from the
fluctuations.
