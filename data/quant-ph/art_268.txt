Quantum information: How much information in a state vector?
Quantum information refers to the distinctive information-processing
properties of quantum systems, which arise when information is stored in or
retrieved from nonorthogonal quantum states. More information is required to
prepare an ensemble of nonorthogonal quantum states than can be recovered from
the ensemble by measurements. Nonorthogonal quantum states cannot be
distinguished reliably, cannot be copied or cloned, and do not lead to exact
predictions for the results of measurements. These properties contrast sharply
with those of information stored in the microstates of a classical system.
