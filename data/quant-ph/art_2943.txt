Teleportation of entanglement for continuous variables
Teleportation of a pure two particle entangled state of continuous variables
by triplet of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger form is considered.
  The three-particle basis needed for a joint measurement is found. It
describes a measurement of momentum one of single particle and total moment and
relative position of the two others. Optical realization using squeezed state
of the light is discussed.
