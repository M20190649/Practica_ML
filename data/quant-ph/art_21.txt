How much time does a tunneling particle spend in the barrier region?
The question in the title may be answered by considering the outcome of a
``weak measurement'' in the sense of Aharonov et al. Various properties of the
resulting time are discussed, including its close relation to the Larmor times.
It is a universal description of a broad class of measurement interactions, and
its physical implications are unambiguous.
