Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger paradoxes for many qudits
We construct GHZ contradictions for three or more parties sharing an
entangled state, the dimension d of each subsystem being an even integer
greater than 2. The simplest example that goes beyond the standard GHZ paradox
(three qubits) involves five ququats (d=4). We then examine the criteria a GHZ
paradox must satisfy in order to be genuinely M-partite and d-dimensional.
