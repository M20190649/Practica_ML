Effective Quantum Observables
Thought experiments about the physical nature of set theoretical
counterexamples to the axiom of choice motivate the investigation of peculiar
constructions, e.g. an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with a modular
quantum logic. Applying a concept due to BENIOFF, we identify the intrinsically
effective Hamiltonians with those observables of quantum theory which may
coexist with a failure of the axiom of choice. Here a self adjoint operator is
intrinsically effective, iff the Schroedinger equation of its generated
semigroup is soluble by means of eigenfunction series expansions.
