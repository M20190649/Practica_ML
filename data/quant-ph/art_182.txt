Empirical logic of finite automata: microstatements versus
  macrostatements
We compare the two approaches to the empirical logic of automata. The first,
called partition logic (logic of microstatements), refers to experiments on
individual automata. The second one, the logic of simulation (logic of
macrostatements), deals with ensembles of automata.
