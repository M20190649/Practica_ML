''Averaged'' statistical thermodynamics, energy equipartition and the
  third law
Arguments are presented that the assumption, implicit to traditional
statistical thermodynamics, that at zero temperature all erratic motions cease,
should be dispensed with. Assuming instead a random ultrarelativistic
unobservable motion, similar to zitterbewegung, it is demonstrated that in an
ideal gas of classical particles the energy equipartition fails in a way that
complies with the third law of thermodynamics.
