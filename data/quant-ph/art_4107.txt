Continuous variable teleportation of single photon states
The properties of continuous variable teleportation of single photon states
are investigated. The output state is different from the input state due to the
non-maximal entanglement in the EPR beams. The photon statistics of the
teleportation output are determined and the correlation between the field
information beta obtained in the teleportation process and the change in photon
number is discussed. The results of the output photon statistics are applied to
the transmission of a qbit encoded in the polarization of a single photon.
