Conditions for complex spectra in a class of PT symmetric potentials
We study a wide class of solvable PT symmetric potentials in order to
identify conditions under which these potentials have regular solutions with
complex energy. Besides confirming previous findings for two potentials, most
of our results are new. We demonstrate that the occurrence of conjugate energy
pairs is a natural phenomenon for these potentials. We demonstrate that the
present method can readily be extended to further potential classes.
