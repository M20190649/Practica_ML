Comment on "Stable Quantum Computation of Unstable Classical Chaos"
I think the title and content of the recent Letter by Georgeot and
Shepelyanski [PRL 86, 5393 (2001), also quant-ph/0101004)] are not correct. As
long as the classical Arnold map is considered, the classical computational
algorithm can be made exactly equivalent with the quantum one. The claimed
advantage of the Letter's quantum algorithm disappears if we correctly restrict
the statistical analysis for the classical Arnold system.
