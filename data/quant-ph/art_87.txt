MARKOV DIFFUSIONS IN COMOVING COORDINATES AND STOCHASTIC QUANTIZATION OF
  THE FREE RELATIVISTIC SPINLESS PARTICLE
We revisit the classical approach of comoving coordinates in relativistic
hydrodynamics and we give a constructive proof for their global existence under
suitable conditions which is proper for stochastic quantization. We show that
it is possible to assign stochastic kinematics for the free relativistic
spinless particle as a Markov diffusion globally defined on ${\sf M}^4$. Then
introducing dynamics by means of a stochastic variational principle with
Einstein's action, we are lead to positive-energy solutions of Klein-Gordon
equation. The procedure exhibits relativistic covariance properties.
