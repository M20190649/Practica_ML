Multi-access channels in quantum information theory
The multi-access channels in quantum information theory are considered.
Classical messages from independent sources, which are represented as some
quantum states, are transported by a channel to one address. The messages can
interact with each other and with external environment. After statement of
problem and proving some general results we investigate physically important
case when information is transported by states of electromagnetic field.
One-way communication by noisy quantum channels is also considered.
