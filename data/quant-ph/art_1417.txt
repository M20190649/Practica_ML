Interaction-free measurement and forward scattering
Interaction-free measurement is shown to arise from the forward-scattered
wave accompanying absorption: a "quantum silhouette" of the absorber.
Accordingly, the process is not free of interaction. For a perfect absorber the
forward-scattered wave is locked both in amplitude and in phase. For an
imperfect one it has a nontrivial phase of dynamical origin (``colored
silhouette"), measurable by interferometry. Other examples of quantum
silhouettes, all controlled by unitarity, are briefly discussed.
