Dynamical localization and signatures of classical phase space
We study the dynamical localization of cold atoms in Fermi accelerator both
in position space and in momentum space. We report the role of classical phase
space in the development of dynamical localization phenomenon. We provide set
of experimentally assessable parameters to perform this work in laboratory.
