Atom Chips
Atoms can be trapped and guided using nano-fabricated wires on surfaces,
achieving the scales required by quantum information proposals. These Atom
Chips form the basis for robust and widespread applications of cold atoms
ranging from atom optics to fundamental questions in mesoscopic physics, and
possibly quantum information systems.
