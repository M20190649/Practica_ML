Nonstandard introduction to squeezing of the electromagnetic field
This article contains a review of an alternative theory of squeezing, based
entirely on the wave function description of the squeezed states. Quantum field
theoretic approach is used to describe the squeezing of the electromagnetic
field in its most complete form that takes into account temporal and spatial
characteristics of the squeezed state. An analog of the Wigner function for the
full electromagnetic field is introduced and expressed in terms of second order
correlation functions. The field-theoretic approach enables one to study the
propagation of the ``squeezing wave'' in space-time. A simple example of weak
squeezing, that allows for all calculations to be done analytically, is
discussed in detail.
