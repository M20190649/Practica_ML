Ground state cooling, quantum state engineering and study of decoherence
  of ions in Paul traps
We investigate single ions of $^{40}Ca^+$ in Paul traps for quantum
information processing. Superpositions of the S$_{1/2}$ electronic ground state
and the metastable D$_{5/2}$ state are used to implement a qubit. Laser light
on the S$_{1/2} \leftrightarrow$ D$_{5/2}$ transition is used for the
manipulation of the ion's quantum state. We apply sideband cooling to the ion
and reach the ground state of vibration with up to 99.9% probability. Starting
from this Fock state $|n=0>$, we demonstrate coherent quantum state
manipulation. A large number of Rabi oscillations and a ms-coherence time is
observed. Motional heating is measured to be as low as one vibrational quantum
in 190 ms. We also report on ground state cooling of two ions.
