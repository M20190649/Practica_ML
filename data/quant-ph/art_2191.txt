Quantum computing with neutral atoms
We develop a method to entangle neutral atoms using cold controlled
collisions. We analyze this method in two particular set-ups: optical lattices
and magnetic micro-traps. Both offer the possibility of performing certain
multi-particle operations in parallel. Using this fact, we show how to
implement efficient quantum error correction and schemes for fault-tolerant
computing.
