A note on Borromean correlations in multipartite quantum systems
If a pure state of a multipartite quantum system is Borromean, that is, its
density matrix becomes product after tracing out any its component then the
initial state is product itself. This shows the essentially classical nature of
Borromean correlations which can not be achieved by entangled pure states.
