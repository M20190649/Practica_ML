Optimization of entanglement witnesses
An entanglement witness (EW) is an operator that allows to detect entangled
states. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for such operators to be
optimal, i.e. to detect entangled states in an optimal way. We show how to
optimize general EW, and then we particularize our results to the
non-decomposable ones; the latter are those that can detect positive partial
transpose entangled states (PPTES). We also present a method to systematically
construct and optimize this last class of operators based on the existence of
``edge'' PPTES, i.e. states that violate the range separability criterion
[Phys. Lett. A{\bf 232}, 333 (1997)] in an extreme manner. This method also
permits the systematic construction of non-decomposable positive maps (PM). Our
results lead to a novel sufficient condition for entanglement in terms of
non-decomposable EW and PM. Finally, we illustrate our results by constructing
optimal EW acting on $H=\C^2\otimes \C^4$. The corresponding PM constitute the
first examples of PM with minimal ``qubit'' domain, or - equivalently - minimal
hermitian conjugate codomain.
