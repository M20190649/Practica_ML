Reflection and Transmission in a Neutron-Spin Test of the Quantum Zeno
  Effect
The dynamics of a quantum system undergoing frequent "measurements", leading
to the so-called quantum Zeno effect, is examined on the basis of a
neutron-spin experiment recently proposed for its demonstration. When the
spatial degrees of freedom are duely taken into account, neutron-reflection
effects become very important and may lead to an evolution which is totally
different from the ideal case.
