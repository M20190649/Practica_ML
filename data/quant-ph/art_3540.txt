Are Interaction-free Measurements Interaction Free?
In 1993 Elitzur and Vaidman introduced the concept of interaction-free
measurements which allowed finding objects without ``touching'' them. In the
proposed method, since the objects were not touched even by photons, thus, the
interaction-free measurements can be called as ``seeing in the dark''. Since
then several experiments have been successfully performed and various
modifications were suggested. Recently, however, the validity of the term
``interaction-free'' has been questioned. The criticism of the name is briefly
reviewed and the meaning of the interaction-free measurements is clarified.
