Separability properties of tripartite states with UxUxU-symmetry
We study separability properties in a 5-dimensional set of states of quantum
systems composed of three subsystems of equal but arbitrary finite Hilbert
space dimension. These are the states, which can be written as linear
combinations of permutation operators, or, equivalently, commute with unitaries
of the form UxUxU. We compute explicitly the following subsets: (1)
triseparable states, which are convex combinations of triple tensor products,
(2) biseparable states, which are separable for a twofold partition of the
system, and (3) states with positive partial transpose with respect to such a
partition.
