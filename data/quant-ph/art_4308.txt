Quantum Summation with an Application to Integration
We study summation of sequences and integration in the quantum model of
computation. We develop quantum algorithms for computing the mean of sequences
which satisfy a p-summability condition and for integration of functions from
Lebesgue spaces L_p([0,1]^d) and analyze their convergence rates. We also prove
lower bounds which show that the proposed algorithms are, in many cases,
optimal within the setting of quantum computing. This extends recent results of
Brassard, Hoyer, Mosca, and Tapp (2000) on computing the mean for bounded
sequences and complements results of Novak (2001) on integration of functions
from Hoelder classes.
