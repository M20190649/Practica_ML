The Capacity of Quantum Channel with General Signal States
It is shown that the capacity of a classical-quantum channel with arbitrary
(possibly mixed) states equals to the maximum of the entropy bound with respect
to all apriori distributions. This completes the recent result of Hausladen,
Jozsa, Schumacher, Westmoreland and Wooters, who proved the equality for the
pure state channel.
