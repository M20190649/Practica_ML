Optimal estimation of two-qubit pure-state entanglement
We present optimal measuring strategies for the estimation of the
entanglement of unknown two-qubit pure states and of the degree of mixing of
unknown single-qubit mixed states, of which N identical copies are available.
The most general measuring strategies are considered in both situations, to
conclude in the first case that a local, although collective, measurement
suffices to estimate entanglement, a non-local property, optimally.
