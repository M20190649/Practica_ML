Quantum Computers and Unstructured Search: Finding and Counting Items
  with an Arbitrarily Entangled Initial State
Grover's quantum algorithm for an unstructured search problem and the Count
algorithm by Brassard et al. are generalized to the case when the initial state
is arbitrarily and maximally entangled. This ansatz might be relevant with
quantum subroutines, when the computational qubits and the environment are
coupled, and in general when the control over the quantum system is partial.
