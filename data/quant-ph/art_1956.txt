Decoherence and continuous measurements: Phenomenology and models
Decoherence of a quantum system induced by the interaction with its
environment (measuring medium) may be presented phenomenologically as a
continuous (or repeated) fuzzy quantum measurement. The dynamics of the system
subject to continuous decoherence (measurement) may be described by the
complex-Hamiltonian Schroedinger equation, stochastic Schroedinger equation of
a certain type or (nonselectively) by the Lindblad master equation. The
formulation of this dynamics with the help of restricted path integrals shows
that the dynamics of the measured system depends only on the information
recorded in the environment. With the help of the complex-Hamiltonian
Schroedinger equation, monitoring a quantum transition is shown to be possible,
at the price of decreasing the transition probability (weak Zeno effect). The
monitoring of the level transition may be realized by a long series of short
weak observations of the system which resulting in controllable slow
decoherence.
