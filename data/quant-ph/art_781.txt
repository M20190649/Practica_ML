Asymptotics of Quantum Relative Entropy From Representation Theoretical
  Viewpoint
In this paper it was proved that the quantum relative entropy $D(\sigma \|
\rho)$ can be asymptotically attained by Kullback Leibler divergences of
probabilities given by a certain sequence of POVMs. The sequence of POVMs
depends on $\rho$, but is independent of the choice of $\sigma$.
