Relativistic Nonlocality in experiments with successive impacts
Relativistic Nonlocality is applied to experiments in which one of the
photons impacts successively at two beam-splitters. It is discussed whether a
time series with 2 non-before impacts can be produced with beam-splitters at
rest, and such an experiment may allow us to decide between Quantum Mechanics
(QM) and Relativistic Nonlocality (RNL).
