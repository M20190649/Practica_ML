Values and the Quantum Conception of Man
Classical mechanics is based upon a mechanical picture of nature that is
fundamentally incorrect. It has been replaced at the basic level by a radically
different theory: quantum mechanics. This change entails an enormous shift in
our basic conception of nature, one that can profoundly alter the scientific
image of man himself. Self-image is the foundation of values, and the
replacement of the mechanistic self-image derived from classical mechanics by
one concordant with quantum mechanics may provide the foundation of a moral
order better suited to our times, a self-image that endows human life with
meaning, responsibility, and a deeper linkage to nature as a whole.
