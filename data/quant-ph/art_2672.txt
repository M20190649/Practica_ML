Quantum interference in the fluorescence of a molecular system
It has been observed experimentally [H.R. Xia, C.Y. Ye, and S.Y. Zhu, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 77}, 1032 (1996)] that quantum interference between two
molecular transitions can lead to a suppression or enhancement of spontaneous
emission. This is manifested in the fluorescent intensity as a function of the
detuning of the driving field from the two-photon resonance condition. Here we
present a theory which explains the observed variation of the number of peaks
with the mutual polarization of the molecular transition dipole moments. Using
master equation techniques we calculate analytically as well as numerically the
steady-state fluorescence, and find that the number of peaks depends on the
excitation process. If the molecule is driven to the upper levels by a
two-photon process, the fluorescent intensity consists of two peaks regardless
of the mutual polarization of the transition dipole moments. If the excitation
process is composed of both a two-step one-photon process and a one-step,
two-photon process, then there are two peaks on transitions with parallel
dipole moments and three peaks on transitions with antiparallel dipole moments.
This latter case is in excellent agreement with the experiment.
