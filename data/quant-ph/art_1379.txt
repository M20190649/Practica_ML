Fluctuation, time-correlation function and geometric Phase
We establish a fluctuation-correlation theorem by relating the quantum
fluctuations in the generator of the parameter change to the time integral of
the quantum correlation function between the projection operator and force
operator of the ``fast'' system. By taking a cue from linear response theory we
relate the quantum fluctuation in the generator to the generalised
susceptibility. Relation between the open-path geometric phase, diagonal
elements of the quantum metric tensor and the force-force correlation function
is provided and the classical limit of the fluctuation-correlation theorem is
also discussed.
