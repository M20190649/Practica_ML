Probabilistic teleportation and entanglement matching
Teleportation may be taken as sending and extracting quantum information
through quantum channels. In this report, it is shown that to get the maximal
probability of exact teleportation through partially entangled quantum
channels, the sender (Alice) need only to operate a measurement which satisfy
an ``entanglement matching'' to this channel. An optimal strategy is also
provided for the receiver (Bob) to extract the quantum information by adopting
general evolutions.
