Cryptographic Distinguishability Measures for Quantum Mechanical States
This paper, mostly expository in nature, surveys four measures of
distinguishability for quantum-mechanical states. This is done from the point
of view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum
cryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous
classical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely,
the probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the
Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon distinguishability (as defined
through mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in
statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several
inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other,
one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic
key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting
inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential
indistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that
may prove useful in the analysis of various quantum cryptographic protocols.
