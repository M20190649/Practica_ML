Quantum Teleportation with Entangled States given by Beam Splittings
Quantum teleportation is rigorously discussed with coherent entang led states
given by beam splittings. The mathematical scheme of beam splitti ng has been
used to study quantum communication and quantum stochastic. We d iscuss the
teleportation process by means of coherent states in this scheme for the
following two cases: (1) Delete the vacuum part from coherent states, whose
compensation provides us a perfect teleportation from Alice to Bob. (2) Use
fully realistic (physical) coherent states, which give s a non-perfect
teleportation but shows that it is exact when the average en ergy (density) of
the coherent vectors goes to infinity.
