The Generalized Quantum Statistics
The concept of wavefunction reduction should be introduced to standard
quantum mechanics in any physical processes where effective reduction of
wavefunction occurs, as well as in the measurement processes. When the overlap
is negligible, each particle obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics even if the
particles are in principle described by totally symmetrized wavefunction
[P.R.Holland, The Quantum Theory of Motion, Cambridge Unversity Press, 1993,
p293]. We generalize the conjecture. That is, particles obey some generalized
statistics that contains the quantum and classical statistics as special cases,
where the degree of overlapping determines the statistics that particles should
obey among continuous generalized statistics. We present an example consistent
with the conjecture.
