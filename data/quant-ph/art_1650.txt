Controlling the flow of information in quantum cloners: Asymmetric
  cloning
We show that the distribution of information at the output of the quantum
cloner can be efficiently controlled via preparation of the quantum cloner. We
present a universal cloning network with the help of which asymmetric cloning
can be performed.
