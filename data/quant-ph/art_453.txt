$sl(2)$ variational schemes for solving one class of quantum nonlinear
  models
Hamiltonians of a wide-spread class of $G_{inv}$-invariant nonlinear quantum
models, including multiboson and frequency conversion ones, are expressed as
non-linear functions of $sl(2)$ generators. It enables us to use standard
variational schemes, based on $sl(2)$ generalized coherent states as trial
functions, for solving both spectral and evolution tasks. In such a manner a
new analytical expression is found for energy spectra in a mean-field
approximation which is beyond quasi-equidistant ones obtained earlier.
