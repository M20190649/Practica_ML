On Bell measurements for teleportation
In this paper we investigate the possibility to make complete Bell
measurements on a product Hilbert space of two two-level bosonic systems. We
restrict our tools to linear elements, like beam splitters and phase shifters,
delay lines and electronically switched linear elements, photo-detectors, and
auxiliary bosons. As a result we show that with these tools a never failing
Bell measurement is impossible.
