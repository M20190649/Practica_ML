Error free quantum communication through noisy channels
We suggest a method to perform a quantum logic gate between distant qubits by
off-resonant field-atom dispersive interactions. The scheme we present is shown
to work ideally even in the presence of errors in the photon channels used for
communication. The stability against errors arises from the paradoxical
situation that the transmitted photons carry no information about the state of
the qubits. In contrast to a previous proposal for ideal communication [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 78, 4293 (1997)] our proposal only involves single atoms in the
sending and receiving devices.
