Lower Bounds for Attainable Fidelity in Entanglement Purification
We derive lower bounds for the attainable fidelity of standard entanglement
purification protocols when local operations and measurements are subjected to
errors. We introduce an error parameter which measures the distance between the
ideal completely positive map describing a purification step and the one in the
presence of errors. We derive non--linear maps for a lower bound of the
fidelity at each purification step in terms of this parameter.
