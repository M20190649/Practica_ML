Quantum Logic Using Sympathetically Cooled Ions
One limit to the fidelity of quantum logic operations on trapped ions arises
from heating of the ions' collective modes of motion. Sympathetic cooling of
the ions during the logic operations may eliminate this source of errors. We
discuss benefits and drawbacks of this proposal, and describe possible
experimental implementations. We also present an overview of trapped-ion
dynamics in this scheme.
