Maximum Information and Quantum Prediction Algorithms
This paper describes an algorithm for selecting a consistent set within the
consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics and investigates its
properties. The algorithm uses a maximum information principle to select from
among the consistent sets formed by projections defined by the Schmidt
decomposition. The algorithm unconditionally predicts the possible events in
closed quantum systems and ascribes probabilities to these events. A simple
spin model is described and a complete classification of all exactly consistent
sets of histories formed from Schmidt projections in the model is proved. This
result is used to show that for this example the algorithm selects a physically
realistic set. Other tentative suggestions in the literature for set selection
algorithms using ideas from information theory are discussed.
