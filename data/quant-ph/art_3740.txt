Strictly isospectral potentials from excited quantum states
The strictly nonrelativistic isospectral scheme based on the general Riccati
solution and Darboux transformation function corresponding to excited states is
presented on the following examples: the harmonic oscillator, the square well,
and the hydrogen atom
