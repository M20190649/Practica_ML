Dynamical Stability and Quantum Chaos of Ions in a Linear Trap
The realization of a paradigm chaotic system, namely the harmonically driven
oscillator, in the quantum domain using cold trapped ions driven by lasers is
theoretically investigated. The simplest characteristics of regular and chaotic
dynamics are calculated. The possibilities of experimental realization are
discussed.
