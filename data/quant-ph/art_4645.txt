Schmidt number of pure states in bipartite quantum systems as an
  algebraic-geometric invariant
Our previous work about algebraic-geometric invariants of the mixed states
are extended and a stronger separability criterion is given. We also show that
the Schmidt number of pure states in bipartite quantum systems, a classical
concept, is actually an algebraic-geometric invariant.
