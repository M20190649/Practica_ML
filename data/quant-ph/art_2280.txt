Gauge invariance and the vacuum state
Quantum field theory is assumed to be gauge invariant. It is shown that for a
Dirac field the assumption of gauge invariance impacts on the way the vacuum
state is defined. It is shown that the conventional definition of the vacuum
state must be modified to take into account the requirements of gauge
invariance.
