A Continuous Transition Between Quantum and Classical Mechanics (I)
In spite of its popularity, it has not been possible to vindicate the
conventional wisdom that classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum
mechanics. The purpose of the present paper is to offer an alternative
formulation of classical mechanics which provides a continuous transition to
quantum mechanics via environment-induced decoherence.
