Schwinger, Pegg and Barnett and a relationship between angular and
  Cartesian quantum descriptions
From a development of an original idea due to Schwinger, it is shown that it
is possible to recover, from the quantum description of a degree of freedom
characterized by a finite number of states (\QTR{it}{i.e}., without classical
counterpart) the usual canonical variables of position/momentum \QTR{it}{and}
angle/angular momentum, relating, maybe surprisingly, the first as a limit of
the later.
