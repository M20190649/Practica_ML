Space Searches with a Quantum Robot
Quantum robots are described as mobile quantum computers and ancillary
systems that move in and interact with arbitrary environments. Their dynamics
is given as tasks which consist of sequences of alternating computation and
action phases. A task example is considered in which a quantum robot searches a
space region to find the location of a system. The possibility that the search
can be more efficient than a classical search is examined by considering use of
Grover's Algorithm to process the search results. For reversible searches this
is problematic for two reasons. One is the removal of entanglements generated
by the search process. The other is that even if the entanglement can be
avoided, the search process in 2-D space regions is no more efficient than a
classical search. However, quantum searches of space regions with 3 or more
dimensions are more efficient than classical searches. Reasons why quantum
robots are interesting independent of these results are briefly summarized.
