From Stochastic Differential Equations to Quantum Field Theory
Covariant stochastic partial (pseudo-)differential equations are studied in
any dimension. In particular a large class of covariant interacting local
quantum fields obeying the Morchio-Strocchi system of axioms for indefinite
quantum field theory is constructed by solving the analysed equations. The
associated random cosurface models are discussed and some elementary properties
of them are outlined.
