Correlation Functions and Spin
The k-electron correlation function of a free chaotic electron beam is
derived with the spin degree of freedom taken into account. It is shown that it
can be expressed with the help of correlation functions for a polarized
electron beam of all orders up to k and the degree of spin polarization. The
form of the correlation function suggests that if the electron beam is not
highly polarized, observing multi-particle correlations should be difficult.
The result can be applied also to chaotic photon beams, the degree of spin
polarization being replaced by the degree of polarization.
