A novel SO(3) picture for quantum searching
An SO(3) picture of the generalized Grover's quantum searching algorithm,with
arbitrary unitary transformation and with arbitrary phase rotations, is
constructed. In this picture, any quantum search operation is a rotation in a 3
dimensional space. Exact formulas for the rotation angle and rotational axis
are given. The probability of finding the marked state is just $(z+1)/2$, where
z is the z-component of the state vector. Exact formulas for this probability
is easily obtained. The phase matching requirement and the failure of algorithm
when phase mismatches are clearly explained.
