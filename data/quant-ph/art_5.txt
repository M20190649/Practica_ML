Kochen-Specker theorem for 8-dimensional space
A Kochen-Specker contradiction is produced with 36 vectors in a real
8-dimensional Hilbert space. These vectors can be combined into 30 distinct
projection operators (14 of rank 2, and 16 of rank 1). A state-specific variant
of this contradiction requires only 13 vectors, a remarkably low number for 8
dimensions.
