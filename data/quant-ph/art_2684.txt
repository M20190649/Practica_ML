Optical qubit by conditional interferometry
We suggest a method to prepare any chosen superposition a0 |0> + a1 |1> of
the vacuum and one-photon states. The method is based on a conditional
double-interferometer fed by an one-photon state and a coherent state. The
scheme involves only linear optical elements and avalanche photodetectors, and
therefore it should be realizable with current technology. A realistic
description of the triggering photodetectors is employed, i.e. we assume that
they can only check, with a certain efficiency, whether or not any photon is
present. We discuss two working regimes, and show that output states with
fidelity arbitrarily close to unit may be obtained, with non vanishing
conditional probability, also for low quantum efficiency at the photodetectors.
