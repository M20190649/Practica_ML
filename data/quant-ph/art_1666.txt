Born's Principle, Action-Reaction Problem and Arrow of Time
We try to obtain Born's principle as a result of a subquantum heat death,
using classical ${\cal H}$-theorem and the definition of a proper quantum
${\cal H}$-theorem, within the framwork of Bohm's theory. We shall show the
possibility of solving the problem of action-reaction asymmetry present in
Bohm's theory and the arrow of time problem in our procedure.
