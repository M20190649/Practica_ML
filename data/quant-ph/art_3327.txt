Which Kind of Two-Particle States Can Be Teleported through a
  Three-Particle Quantum Channel?
The use of a three-particle quantum channel to teleport entangled states
through a slight modification of the standard teleportation procedure is
studied. It is shown that it is not possible to perform successful
teleportation of an arbitrary and unknown two-particle entangled state,
following our version of the standard teleportation procedure. On the contrary,
it is shown which, and in how many different ways, particular classes of
two-particle states can be teleported.
