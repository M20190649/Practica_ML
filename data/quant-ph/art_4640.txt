Simple trace criterion for classification of multilayers
The action of any lossless multilayer is described by a transfer matrix that
can be factorized in terms of three basic matrices. We introduce a simple trace
criterion that classifies multilayers in three classes with properties closely
related with one (and only one) of these three basic matrices.
