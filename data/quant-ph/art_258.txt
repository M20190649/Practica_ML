Naive Realism about Operators
A source of much difficulty and confusion in the interpretation of quantum
mechanics is a ``naive realism about operators.'' By this we refer to various
ways of taking too seriously the notion of operator-as-observable, and in
particular to the all too casual talk about ``measuring operators'' that occurs
when the subject is quantum mechanics. Without a specification of what should
be meant by ``measuring'' a quantum observable, such an expression can have no
clear meaning. A definite specification is provided by Bohmian mechanics, a
theory that emerges from Sch\"rodinger's equation for a system of particles
when we merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. Bohmian mechanics
clarifies the status and the role of operators as observables in quantum
mechanics by providing the operational details absent from standard quantum
mechanics. It thereby allows us to readily dismiss all the radical claims
traditionally enveloping the transition from the classical to the quantum
realm---for example, that we must abandon classical logic or classical
probability. The moral is rather simple: Beware naive realism, especially about
operators!
