Laser Field Induced Birefringence and Enhancement of Magneto-optical
  Rotation
An initially isotropic medium, when subjected to either a magnetic field or a
coherent field, can induce anisotropy in the medium and can cause the
polarization of a probe field to rotate. Therefore the rotation of probe
polarization, due to magnetic field alone, can be controlled efficiently with
the use of a coherent control field. We demonstrate this enhancement of the
magneto-optical rotation (MOR) of a linearly polarized light, by doing detailed
calculations on a system with relevant transitions $j=0\leftrightarrow
j=1\leftrightarrow j=0$.
