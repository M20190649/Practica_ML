Real continuum
Some physical consequences of the negation of the continuum hypothesis are
considered. It is shown that quantum and classical mechanics are component
parts of the multicomponent description of the set of variable infinite
cardinality. Existence and properties of the set follow directly from the
independence of the continuum hypothesis. Particular emphasis is laid on
set-theoretic aspect.
