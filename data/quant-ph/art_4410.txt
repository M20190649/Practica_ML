A double-slit quantum eraser
We report a quantum eraser experiment which actually uses a Young double-slit
to create interference. The experiment can be considered an optical analogy of
an experiment proposed by Scully, Englert and Walther. One photon of an
entangled pair is incident on a Young double-slit of appropriate dimensions to
create an interference pattern in a distant detection region. Quarter-wave
plates, oriented so that their fast axes are orthogonal, are placed in front of
each slit to serve as which-path markers. The quarter-wave plates mark the
polarization of the interfering photon and thus destroy the interference
pattern. To recover interference, we measure the polarization of the other
entangled photon. In addition, we perform the experiment under delayed erasure
circumstances.
