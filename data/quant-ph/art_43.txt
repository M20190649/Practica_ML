Nonlocal and local ghost fields in quantum correlations.
Einstein Podolsky Rosen quantum correlations are discussed from the
perspective of a ghost field introduced by Einstein. The concepts of ghost
field, hidden variables, local reality and the Bell inequality are reviewed. In
the framework of the correlated singlet state, it is shown that quantum
mechanics can be cast in a way that has the form of either nonpositive and
local ghost field or a positive and nonlocal ghost field.
