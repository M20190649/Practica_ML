Heterodyne Detection of Gravitational Waves in a Michelson
  Interferometer with a Vibrating Mirror
A new heterodyne detection method is suggested for detecting gravitational
waves in a Michelson Interferometer. The method is based on interference
between phase changes which are induced by a vibrating mirror with phase
changes which are due to the gravitational waves. The advantage of using a
second order correlation function in the present analysis is discussed.
