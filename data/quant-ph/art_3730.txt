Private entanglement over arbitrary distances, even using noisy
  apparatus
We give a security proof of quantum cryptography based entirely on
entanglement purification. Our proof applies to all possible attacks
(individual and coherent). It implies the security of cryptographic keys
distributed with the help of entanglement-based quantum repeaters. We prove the
security of the obtained quantum channel which may not only be used for quantum
key distribution, but also for secure, albeit noisy, transmission of quantum
information.
