Is an Electromagnetic Extension of the Schroedinger Equation Possible?
The idea of equivalence of the free electromagnetic phase and
quantum-mechanical one is investigated in an attempt to seek modifications of
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation that could realize it. It is assumed that physically
valid realizations are compatibile with the U(1)-gauge and Galilean invariance.
It is shown that such extensions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation do not exist,
which also means that despite their apparent similarity the quantum-mechanical
phase is essentially different from the electromagnetic one.
