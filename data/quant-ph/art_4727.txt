Local Realistic Model for Two-Particle Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Pairs
A local realistic model for quantum mechanics of two-particle
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is proposed. In this model, it is the strict
obedience of conservation laws in each event at the quantum level that uphold
the perfect correlation of two spatially-separated particles, instead of
nonlocality in the orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics. Therefore, one
can conclude that all components of the spin of two particles, and the position
and momentum of a particle can be measured simultaneously. The proposed model
yields the same statistical prediction on an ensemble of individual particles
as the orthodox formulation does. This suggests that the wave function is not a
complete description of individual particle as assumed in the orthodox
formulation, but only a statistical description of an ensemble of particles.
