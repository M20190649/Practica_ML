Efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing
Fault tolerant quantum computing methods which work with efficient quantum
error correcting codes are discussed. Several new techniques are introduced to
restrict accumulation of errors before or during the recovery. Classes of
eligible quantum codes are obtained, and good candidates exhibited. This
permits a new analysis of the permissible error rates and minimum overheads for
robust quantum computing. It is found that, under the standard noise model of
ubiquitous stochastic, uncorrelated errors, a quantum computer need be only an
order of magnitude larger than the logical machine contained within it in order
to be reliable. For example, a scale-up by a factor of 22, with gate error rate
of order $10^{-5}$, is sufficient to permit large quantum algorithms such as
factorization of thousand-digit numbers.
