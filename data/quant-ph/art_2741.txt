Geometric quantum computation with NMR
The experimental realisation of the basic constituents of quantum information
processing devices, namely fault-tolerant quantum logic gates, requires
conditional quantum dynamics, in which one subsystem undergoes a coherent
evolution that depends on the quantum state of another subsystem. In
particular, the subsystem may acquire a conditional phase shift. Here we
consider a novel scenario in which this phase is of geometric rather than
dynamical origin. As the conditional geometric (Berry) phase depends only on
the geometry of the path executed it is resilient to certain types of errors,
and offers the potential of an intrinsically fault-tolerant way of performing
quantum gates. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has already been used to
demonstrate both simple quantum information processing and Berry's phase. Here
we report an NMR experiment which implements a conditional Berry phase, and
thus a controlled phase shift gate. This constitutes the first elementary
geometric quantum computation.
