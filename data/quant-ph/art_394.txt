Consistent Histories and Quantum Reasoning
A system of quantum reasoning for a closed system is developed by treating
non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a stochastic theory. The sample space
corresponds to a decomposition, as a sum of orthogonal projectors, of the
identity operator on a Hilbert space of histories. Provided a consistency
condition is satisfied, the corresponding Boolean algebra of histories, called
a {\it framework}, can be assigned probabilities in the usual way, and within a
single framework quantum reasoning is identical to ordinary probabilistic
reasoning. A refinement rule, which allows a probability distribution to be
extended from one framework to a larger (refined) framework, incorporates the
dynamical laws of quantum theory. Two or more frameworks which are incompatible
because they possess no common refinement cannot be simultaneously employed to
describe a single physical system.
