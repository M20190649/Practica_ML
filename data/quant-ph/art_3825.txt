On the connection between the radial momentum operator and the
  Hamiltonian in n dimensions
The radial momentum operator in quantum mechanics is usually obtained through
canonical quantization of the (symmetrical form of the) classical radial
momentum. We show that the well known connection between the Hamiltonian of a
free particle and the radial momentum operator $\hat{H}=\hat{P}_{r}^2/2m+
$\hat{L}^2$}/2mr^{2}$ is true only in one or three dimensions. In general, an
extra term of the form $\hbar^{2}(n-1)(n-3)/ 2m \cdot 4r^{2}$ has to be added
to the Hamiltonian.
