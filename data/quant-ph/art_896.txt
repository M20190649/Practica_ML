Generation of single-mode SU(1,1) intelligent states and an analytic
  approach to their quantum statistical properties
We discuss a scheme for generation of single-mode photon states associated
with the two-photon realization of the SU(1,1) algebra. This scheme is based on
the process of non-degenerate down-conversion with the signal prepared
initially in the squeezed vacuum state and with a measurement of the photon
number in one of the output modes. We focus on the generation and properties of
single-mode SU(1,1) intelligent states which minimize the uncertainty relations
for Hermitian generators of the group. Properties of the intelligent states are
studied by using a ``weak'' extension of the analytic representation in the
unit disk. Then we are able to obtain exact analytical expressions for
expectation values describing quantum statistical properties of the SU(1,1)
intelligent states. Attention is mainly devoted to the study of photon
statistics and linear and quadratic squeezing.
