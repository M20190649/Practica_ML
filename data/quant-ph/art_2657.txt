Position-momentum local realism violation of the Hardy type
We show that it is, in principle, possible to perform local realism violating
experiments of the Hardy type in which only position and momentum measurements
are made on two particles emanating from a common source. In the optical
domain, homodyne detection of the in-phase and out-of-phase amplitude
components of an electromagnetic field is analogous to position and momentum
measurement. Hence, local realism violations of the Hardy type are possible in
optical systems employing only homodyne detection.
