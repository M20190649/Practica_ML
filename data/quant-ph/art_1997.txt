The cost of exactly simulating quantum entanglement with classical
  communication
We investigate the amount of communication that must augment classical local
hidden variable models in order to simulate the behaviour of entangled quantum
systems. We consider the scenario where a bipartite measurement is given from a
set of possibilities and the goal is to obtain exactly the same correlations
that arise when the actual quantum system is measured. We show that, in the
case of a single pair of qubits in a Bell state, a constant number of bits of
communication is always sufficient--regardless of the number of measurements
under consideration. We also show that, in the case of a system of n Bell
states, a constant times 2^n bits of communication are necessary.
