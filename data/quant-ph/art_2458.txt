Variational Ansatz for PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics
A variational calculation of the energy levels of a class of PT-invariant
quantum mechanical models described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H= p^2 -
(ix)^N with N positive and x complex is presented. Excellent agreement is
obtained for the ground state and low lying excited state energy levels and
wave functions. We use an energy functional with a three parameter class of
PT-symmetric trial wave functions in obtaining our results.
