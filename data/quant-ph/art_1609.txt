The Three-Box "Paradox" and Other Reasons to Reject the Counterfactual
  Usage of the ABL Rule
An apparent paradox proposed by Aharonov and Vaidman in which a single
particle can be found with certainty in two (or more) boxes is analyzed by way
of a simple thought experiment. It is found that the apparent paradox arises
from an invalid counterfactual usage of the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL)
rule, and effectively attributes conflicting properties not to the same
particle but to different particles. A connection is made between the present
analysis and the consistent histories formulation of Griffiths. Finally, a
critique is given of some recent counterarguments by
  Vaidman against the rejection of the counterfactual usage of the ABL rule.
