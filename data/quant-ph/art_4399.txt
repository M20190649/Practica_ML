Quantum memory for photons: I. Dark state polaritons
An ideal and reversible transfer technique for the quantum state between
light and metastable collective states of matter is presented and analyzed in
detail. The method is based on the control of photon propagation in coherently
driven 3-level atomic media, in which the group velocity is adiabatically
reduced to zero. Form-stable coupled excitations of light and matter
(``dark-state polaritons'') associated with the propagation of quantum fields
in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency are identified, their basic
properties discussed and their application for quantum memories for light
analyzed.
