Limits for compression of quantum information carried by ensembles of
  mixed states
We consider the problem of compression of the quantum information carried by
ensemble of mixed states. We prove that for arbitrary coding schemes the least
number of qubits needed to convey the signal states asymptotically faithfully
is bounded from below by the Holevo function
$S(\varrho)-\sum_ip_iS(\varrho_i)$. We also show that a compression protocol
can be composed with another one, provided that the latter offers perfect
transmission. Such a compound protocol is applied to the case of binary source.
It is conjectured to reach the obtained bound. Finally, we point out that in
the case of mixed signal states there could be a difference between the maximal
compression rates at the coding schemes which are ``blind'' to the signal and
the ones which assume the knowledge about the identities of the signal states.
