Simple Scheme for Efficient Linear Optics Quantum Gates
We describe the construction of a conditional quantum control-not (CNOT) gate
from linear optical elements following the program of Knill, Laflamme and
Milburn [Nature {\bf 409}, 46 (2001)]. We show that the basic operation of this
gate can be tested using current technology. We then simplify the scheme
significantly.
