On the observation of decoherence with a movable mirror
Following almost a century of debate on possible `independent of measurement'
elements of reality, or `induced' elements of reality - originally invoked as
an ad-hoc collapse postulate, we propose a novel line of interference
experiments which may be able to examine the regime of induced elements of
reality. At the basis of the proposed experiment, lies the hypothesis that all
models of 'induced' elements of reality should exhibit symmetry breaking within
quantum evolution. The described {\em symmetry experiment} is thus aimed at
being able to detect and resolve symmetry breaking signatures.
