Antibunching effect of the radiation field in a microcavity with a
  mirror undergoing heavily damping oscillation
The interaction between the radiation field in a microcavity with a mirror
undergoing damping oscillation is investigated. Under the heavily damping
cases, the mirror variables are adiabatically eliminated.
  The the stationary conditions of the system are discussed. The small
fluctuation approximation around steady values is applied to analysis the
antibunching effect of the cavity field. The antibunching condition is given
under two limit cases.
