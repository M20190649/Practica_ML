Substituting Quantum Entanglement for Communication
We show that quantum entanglement can be used as a substitute for
communication when the goal is to compute a function whose input data is
distributed among remote parties. Specifically, we show that, for a particular
function among three parties (each of which possesses part of the function's
input), a prior quantum entanglement enables one of them to learn the value of
the function with only two bits of communication occurring among the parties,
whereas, without quantum entanglement, three bits of communication are
necessary. This result contrasts the well-known fact that quantum entanglement
cannot be used to simulate communication among remote parties.
