A Quantum Adiabatic Evolution Algorithm Applied to Random Instances of
  an NP-Complete Problem
A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the
Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum
adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum
computing. We test one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated,
hard, instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we can
simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm works well, and provides evidence
that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform
ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.
