Measurement of the photonic de Broglie wavelength of biphotons generated
  by spontaneous parametric down-conversion
Using a basic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we demonstrate experimentally the
measurement of the photonic de Broglie wavelength of an entangled photon pair
(a biphoton) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The observed
interference manifests the concept of the photonic de Broglie wavelength. The
result also provides a proof-of-principle of the quantum lithography that
utilizes the reduced interferometric wavelength.
