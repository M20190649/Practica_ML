Quantum Averaging I: Poincaré--von Zeipel is Rayleigh--Schrödinger
An exact analogue of the method of averaging in classical mechanics is
constructed for self--adjoint operators. It is shown to be completely
equivalent to the usual Rayleigh--Schr\"odinger perturbation theory but gives
the sums over intermediate states in closed form expressions. The anharmonic
oscillator and the Henon--Heiles system are treated as examples to illustrate
the quantum averaging method.
