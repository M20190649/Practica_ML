Quantum optical input--output relations for dispersive and lossy
  multi-slab dielectric plates
Using the Green function approach to the problem of quantization of the
phenomenological Maxwell theory, the propagation of quantized radiation through
dispersive and absorptive multilayer dielectric plates is studied.
Input--output relations are derived, with special emphasis on the determination
of the quantum noise generators associated with the absorption of radiation
inside the dielectric matter. The input--output relations are used to express
arbitrary correlation functions of the outgoing field in terms of correlation
functions of the incoming field and those of the noise generators. To
illustrate the theory, the effect of a single-slab plate on the mean
photon-number densities in the frequency domain is discussed in more detail.
