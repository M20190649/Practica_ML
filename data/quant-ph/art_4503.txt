On the "Fake" Inferred Entanglement Associated with the Maximum Entropy
  Inference of Quantum States
The inference of entangled quantum states by recourse to the maximum entropy
principle is considered in connection with the recently pointed out problem of
fake inferred entanglement [R. Horodecki, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\it 59}
(1999) 1799]. We show that there are operators $\hat A$, both diagonal and non
diagonal in the Bell basis, such that when the expectation value $<\hat A>$ is
taken as prior information the problem of fake entanglement is not solved by
adding a new constraint associated with the mean value of $\hat A^2$ (unlike
what happens when the partial information is given by the expectation value of
a Bell operator). The fake entanglement generated by the maximum entropy
principle is also studied quantitatively by comparing the entanglement of
formation of the inferred state with that of the original one.
