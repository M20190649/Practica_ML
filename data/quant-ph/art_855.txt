Radon transform and pattern functions in quantum tomography
The two-dimensional Radon transform of the Wigner quasiprobability is
introduced in canonical form and the functions playing a role in its inversion
are discussed. The transformation properties of this Radon transform with
respect to displacement and squeezing of states are studied and it is shown
that the last is equivalent to a symplectic transformation of the variables of
the Radon transform with the contragredient matrix to the transformation of the
variables in the Wigner quasiprobability. The reconstruction of the density
operator from the Radon transform and the direct reconstruction of its
Fock-state matrix elements and of its normally ordered moments are discussed.
It is found that for finite-order moments the integration over the angle can be
reduced to a finite sum over a discrete set of angles. The reconstruction of
the Fock-state matrix elements from the normally ordered moments leads to a new
representation of the pattern functions by convergent series over even or odd
Hermite polynomials which is appropriate for practical calculations. The
structure of the pattern functions as first derivatives of the products of
normalizable and nonnormalizable eigenfunctions to the number operator is
considered from the point of view of this new representation.
