Phenomenological damping in trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
The method of phenomenological damping developed by Pitaevskii for
superfluidity near the $\lambda$ point is simulated numerically for the case of
a dilute, alkali, inhomogeneous Bose-condensed gas near absolute zero. We study
several features of this method in describing the damping of excitations in a
Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, we show that the method may be employed
to obtain numerically accurate ground states for a variety of trap potentials.
