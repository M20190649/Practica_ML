Polarization state of a biphoton: quantum ternary logic
Polarization state of biphoton light generated via collinear
frequency-degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion is considered. A
biphoton is described by a three-component polarization vector, its arbitrary
transformations relating to the SU(3) group. A subset of such transformations,
available with retardation plates, is realized experimentally. In particular,
two independent orthogonally polarized beams of type-I biphotons are
transformed into a beam of type-II biphotons. Polarized biphotons are suggested
as ternary analogs of two-state quantum systems (qubits).
