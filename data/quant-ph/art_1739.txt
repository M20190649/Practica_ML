Governing dynamics by squeezing in a system of cold trapped ions
We consider a system of laser-cooled ions in a linear harmonic trap and study
the phenomenon of squeezing exchange between their internal and motional
degrees of freedom. An interesting relation between the quantum noise reduction
(squeezing) and the dynamical evolution is found when the internal and motional
subsystems are prepared in properly squeezed (intelligent) states.
Specifically, the evolution of the system is fully governed by the relative
strengths of spectroscopic and motional squeezing, including the phenomenon of
total cancellation of the interaction when the initial squeezing parameters are
equal.
