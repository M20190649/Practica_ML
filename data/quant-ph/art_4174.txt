Enhanced Autocompensating Quantum Cryptography System
We have improved the hardware and software of our autocompensating system for
quantum key distribution by replacing bulk optical components at the end
stations with fiber-optic equivalents and implementing software that
synchronizes end-station activities, communicates basis choices, corrects
errors and performs privacy amplification over a local area network. The all
fiber-optic arrangement provides stable, efficient and high-contrast routing of
the photons. The low bit error rate leads to high error correction efficiency
and minimizes data sacrifice during privacy amplification. Characterization
measurements made on a number of commercial avalanche photodiodes are presented
that highlight the need for improved devices tailored specifically for quantum
information applications. A scheme for frequency shifting the photons returning
from Alice's station to allow them to be distinguished from backscattered noise
photons is also described.
