Accessible information in quantum measurement
The amount of information that can be accessed via measurement of a quantum
system prepared in different states is limited by the Kholevo bound. We present
a simple proof of this theorem and its extension to sequential measurements
based on the properties of quantum conditional and mutual entropies. The proof
relies on a minimal physical model of the measurement which does not assume
environmental decoherence, and has an intuitive diagrammatic representation.
