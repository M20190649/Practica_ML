Quantum limits of cold damping with optomechanical coupling
Thermal noise of a mirror can be reduced by cold damping. The displacement is
measured with a high-finesse cavity and controlled with the radiation pressure
of a modulated light beam. We establish the general quantum limits of noise in
cold damping mechanisms and we show that the optomechanical system allows to
reach these limits. Displacement noise can be arbitrarily reduced in a narrow
frequency band. In a wide-band analysis we show that thermal fluctuations are
reduced as with classical damping whereas quantum zero-point fluctuations are
left unchanged. The only limit of cold damping is then due to zero-point energy
of the mirror
