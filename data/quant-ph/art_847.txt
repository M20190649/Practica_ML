Saddle scars: Existence and applications
A quantum scar is a wave function which displays an high intensity in the
region of a classical unstable periodic orbit. Saddle scars are states related
to the unstable harmonic motions along the stable manifold of a saddle point of
the potential. Using a semiclassical method it is shown that, independently of
the overall structure of the potential, the local dynamics of the saddle point
is sufficient to insure the general existence of this type of scars and their
factorized structure is obtained. Potentially useful situations are identified,
where these states appear (directly or in disguise) and might be used for
quantum control purposes.
