Comment on Mohrhoff's "What quantum mechanics is trying to tell us"
Mohrhoff proposes using the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule for
time-symmetric ``objective'' (meaning non-epistemic) probabilities
corresponding to the possible outcomes of not-actually-performed measurements
between specified pre- and post-selection measurement outcomes. It is
emphasized that the ABL rule was formulated on the assumption that such
intervening measurements are actually made and that it does not necessarily
apply to counterfactual situations. The exact nature of the application of the
ABL rule considered by Mohrhoff is made explicit and is shown to fall short of
his stated counterfactual claim.
