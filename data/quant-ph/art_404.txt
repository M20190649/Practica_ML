Complementarity and Phase Distributions for Angular Momentum Systems
Interferences in the distributions of complementary variables for angular
momentum - two level systems are discussed. A quantum phase distribution is
introduced for angular momentum. Explicit results for the phase distributions
and the number distributions for atomic coherent states, squeezed states and
superpositions of coherent states are given. These results clearly demonstrate
the issue of complementarity and provide us with results analogous to those for
the radiation field.
