Parametrization and distillability of three-qubit entanglement
There is an ongoing effort to quantify entanglement of quantum pure states
for systems with more than two subsystems. We consider three approaches to this
problem for three-qubit states: choosing a basis which puts the state into a
standard form, enumerating ``local invariants,'' and using operational
quantities such as the number of maximally entangled states which can be
distilled. In this paper we evaluate a particular standard form, the {\it
Schmidt form}, which is a generalization of the Schmidt decomposition for
bipartite pure states. We show how the coefficients in this case can be
parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful local invariants; we use
this form to prove the efficacy of a particular distillation technique for GHZ
triplets; and we relate the yield of GHZs to classes of states with unusual
entanglement properties, showing that these states represent extremes of
distillability as functions of two local invariants.
