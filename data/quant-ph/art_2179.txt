Adiabatic population transfer via multiple intermediate states
This paper discusses a generalization of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) in which the single intermediate state is replaced by $N$ intermediate
states. Each of these states is connected to the initial state $\state{i}$ with
a coupling proportional to the pump pulse and to the final state $\state{f}$
with a coupling proportional to the Stokes pulse, thus forming a parallel
multi-$\Lambda$ system. It is shown that the dark (trapped) state exists only
when the ratio between each pump coupling and the respective Stokes coupling is
the same for all intermediate states. We derive the conditions for existence of
a more general adiabatic-transfer state which includes transient contributions
from the intermediate states but still transfers the population from state
$\state{i}$ to state $\state{f}$ in the adiabatic limit. We present various
numerical examples for success and failure of multi-$\Lambda$ STIRAP which
illustrate the analytic predictions. Our results suggest that in the general
case of arbitrary couplings, it is most appropriate to tune the pump and Stokes
lasers either just below or just above all intermediate states.
