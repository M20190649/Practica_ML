Decoherence in QED at finite temperature
We consider a wave packet of a charged particle passing through a cavity
filled with photons at temperature T and investigate its localization and
interference properties. It is shown that the wave packet becomes localized and
the interference disappears with an exponential speed after a sufficiently long
path through the cavity.
