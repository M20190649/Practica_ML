Two-photocurrent devices
Heterodyne, eight-port homodyne and six-port homodyne detectors belong to the
class of two-photocurrent devices. Their full equivalence in probing radiation
field has been proved both for ideal and not fully efficient photodetectors.
The output probability distribution has been also evaluated for a generic probe
mode.
