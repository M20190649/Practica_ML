Quantum computation based on particle statistics
In spite of their evident logical character, particle statistics symmetries
are not among the inherently quantum features exploited in quantum computation.
A difficulty may be that, being a constant of motion of a unitary evolution, a
particle statistics symmetry cannot affect the course of such an evolution. We
try to avoid this possible deadlock by introducing a generalized
(counterfactual, blunt) formulation where this type of symmetry becomes a
watchdog effect shaping the evolution of a unitary computation process. The
work is an exploration.
