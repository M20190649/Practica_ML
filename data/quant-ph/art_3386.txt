Quantum Kolmogorov Complexity
In this paper we give a definition for quantum Kolmogorov complexity. In the
classical setting, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of the
shortest program that can produce this string as its output. It is a measure of
the amount of innate randomness (or information) contained in the string.
  We define the quantum Kolmogorov complexity of a qubit string as the length
of the shortest quantum input to a universal quantum Turing machine that
produces the initial qubit string with high fidelity. The definition of Vitanyi
(Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Annual Conference on Computational Complexity,
2000) measures the amount of classical information, whereas we consider the
amount of quantum information in a qubit string. We argue that our definition
is natural and is an accurate representation of the amount of quantum
information contained in a quantum state.
