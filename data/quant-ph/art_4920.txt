Causal Interpretation and Quantum Phase Space
We show that the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation can be easily implemented in
quantum phase space through the method of quasi-distributions. This method
establishes a connection with the formalism of the Wigner function. As a
by-product, we obtain the rules for evaluating the expectation values and
probabilities associated with a general observable in the de Broglie-Bohm
formulation. Finally, we discuss some aspects of the dynamics.
