Relativistic semiclassical wave equation and its solution
The properties of relativistic particles in the quasiclassical region are
investigated. The relativistic semiclassical wave equation appropriate in the
quasiclassical region is derived. It is shown that the leading-order WKB
quantization rule is the appropriate method to solve the equation obtained.
