Local/Non-Local Complementarity in Topological Effects
In certain topological effects the accumulation of a quantum phase shift is
accompanied by a local observable effect. We show that such effects manifest a
complementarity between non-local and local attributes of the topology, which
is reminiscent but yet different from the usual wave-particle complementarity.
This complementarity is not a consequence of non-commutativity, rather it is
due to the non-canonical nature of the observables. We suggest that a
local/non-local complementarity is a general feature of topological effects
that are ``dual'' to the AB effect.
