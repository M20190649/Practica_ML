EPR states for von Neumann algebras
In a recent paper [quant-ph/9910066], Arens and Varadarajan gave a
characterization of what they call EPR-states on a bipartite composite quantum
system. By definition, such states imply perfect correlation between suitable
pairs of observables in the two subsystems, and the task is to determine all
such correlated pairs for a given state. In this note the argument is shortened
and simplified, and at the same time extended to observables in general von
Neumann algebras, which naturally arise in quantum field theory.
