On the Distinguishability of Relativistic Quantum States in Quantum
  Cryptography
Relativistic quantum field theory imposes additional fundamental restrictions
on the distinguishability of quantum states. Because of the unavoidable
delocalization of the quantum field states in the Minkowski space-time, the
reliable (with unit probability) distinguishability of orthogonal states
formally requires infinite time. For the cryptographic protocols which are
finite in time the latter means that the effective ``noise'' is present even in
the ideal communication channel because of the non-localizability of the
quantum field states.
