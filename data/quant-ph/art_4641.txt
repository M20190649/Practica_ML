Distillability, Bell inequalities and multiparticle bound entanglement
We study the relation between violation of Bell inequalities and
distillability properties of quantum states. Recently, D\"ur has shown that
there are some multiparticle bound entangled states, non-separable and
non-distillable, that violate a Bell inequality. We prove that for all the
states violating this inequality there exist at least one splitting of the
parties into two groups such that some pure-state entanglement can be
distilled, obtaining a connection between Bell inequalities and bipartite
distillable entanglement.
