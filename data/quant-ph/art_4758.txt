Variable length universal entanglement concentration by local operations
  and its application to teleportation and dense coding
Using invariance of the $n$-th tensored state w.r.t. the $n$-th symmetric
group, we propose a 'variable length' universal entanglement concentration
without classical communication. Like variable length data compression,
arbitrary unknown states are concentrated into perfect Bell states and not
approximate Bell states and the number of Bell states obtained is equal to the
optimal rate asymptotically with the probability 1. One of the point of our
scheme is that we need no classical communication at all. Using this method, we
can construct a universal teleportation and a universal dense coding.
