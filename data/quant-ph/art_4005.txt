Quantum statistics via perturbation effects of preparation procedures
We study the following problem: Is it possible to explain the quantum
interference of probabilities in the purely corpuscular model for elementary
particles? We demonstrate that (by taking into account perturbation effects of
measurement and preparation procedures) we can obtain $\cos\theta$-perturbation
(interference term) in probabilistic rule connecting preparation procedures for
purely corpuscular objects. On one hand, our investigation demonstrated that
there is nothing special in so called `quantum probabilities': the right choice
of statistical ensembles gives the possibility to escape all `pathologies'. On
the other hand, we found that the standard trigonometric interference of
alternatives (observed, in particular, in quantum mechanics) is not the unique
possibility to extend (disturb) the conventional probabilistic rule for
addition of alternatives. There exist two other probabilistic rules that
connect three preparation procedures: hyperbolic and hyper-trigonometric
interferences.
