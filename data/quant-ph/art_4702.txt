Qubit authentication
Secure communication requires message authentication. In this paper we
address the problem of how to authenticate quantum information sent through a
quantum channel between two communicating parties with the minimum amount of
resources. Specifically, our objective is to determine whether one elementary
quantum message (a qubit) can be authenticated with a key of minimum length. We
show that, unlike the case of classical-message quantum authentication, this is
not possible.
