Spatiotemporal Chaos of Soliton in a Generalized Skyrme Model with the
  Modified Symmetrybreaking Term
The chiral symmetry-breaking term of the Skyrme model with massive pion is
modified to obtain the hedgehog profile function which is in best coincidence
with the kink-like profile function. For the modified Lagrangian, the minimum
of the energy of the B=2 twisty skyrmion configuration is lower than the values
for both the cases of the Skyrme Lagrangian with and without the non-modified
symmetry-breaking term. The equations of motion for the time-dependent hedgehog
of this model and for a generalizated Skyrme model including sixth-order
stabilizing term are derived and integrated nummerically. The time evolution of
soliton is obtained. We have observed the seft-exitation of soliton because of
the fast developement of fluctuation.
