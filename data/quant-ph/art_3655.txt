Schroedinger-Cat Entangled State Reconstruction in the Penning Trap
We present a tomographic method for the reconstruction of the full entangled
quantum state for the cyclotron and spin degrees of freedom of an electron in a
Penning trap. Numerical simulations of the reconstruction of several
significant quantum states show that the method turns out to be quite accurate.
