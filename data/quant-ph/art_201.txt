Noncommuting mixed states cannot be broadcast
We show that, given a general mixed state for a quantum system, there are no
physical means for {\it broadcasting\/} that state onto two separate quantum
systems, even when the state need only be reproduced marginally on the separate
systems. This result generalizes and extends the standard no-cloning theorem
for pure states.
