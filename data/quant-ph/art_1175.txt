Note on the stability of a confined Bose gas: Comment on
  quant-ph/9712030 by L. Salasnich
We demonstrate analytically that a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a
harmonic trap with zero-range attractive interparticle interactions is unstable
if there is more than 1 boson. Replacing the zero-range interaction by a
short-range attractive interaction lifts the instability, and leads to a
pronounced clustering, by which the particles leak out of the condensate.
