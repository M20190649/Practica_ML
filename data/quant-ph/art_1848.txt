Stationary States in Saturated Two-Photon Processes and Generation of
  Phase-Averaged Mixtures of Even and Odd Quantum States
We consider a relaxation of a single mode of the quantized field in a
presence of one- and two-photon absorption and emission processes. Exact
stationary solutions of the master equation for the diagonal elements of the
density matrix in the Fock basis are found in the case of completely saturated
two-photon emission. If two-photon processes dominate over single-photon ones,
the stationary state is a mixture of phase averaged even and odd coherent
states.
