The theory of heating of the quantum ground state of trapped ions
Using a displacement operator formalism, I analyse the depopulation of the
vibrational ground state of trapped ions. Two heating times, one characterizing
short time behaviour, the other long time behaviour are found. The short time
behaviour is analyzed both for single and multiple ions, and a formula for the
relative heating rates of different modes is derived. The possibility of
correction of heating via the quantum Zeno effect, and the exploitation of the
suppression of heating of higher modes to reduce errors in quantum computation
is considered.
