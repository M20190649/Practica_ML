Noise in Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm
Grover's quantum algorithm improves any classical search algorithm. We show
how random Gaussian noise at each step of the algorithm can be modelled easily
because of the exact recursion formulas available for computing the quantum
amplitude in Grover's algorithm. We study the algorithm's intrinsic robustness
when no quantum correction codes are used, and evaluate how much noise the
algorithm can bear with, in terms of the size of the phone book and a desired
probability of finding the correct result. The algorithm loses efficiency when
noise is added, but does not slow down. We also study the maximal noise under
which the iterated quantum algorithm is just as slow as the classical
algorithm. In all cases, the width of the allowed noise scales with the size of
the phone book as N^-2/3.
