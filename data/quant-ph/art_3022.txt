CSL Collapse Model And Spontaneous Radiation: An Update
A brief review is given of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL)
model in which a classical field interacts with quantized particles to cause
dynamical wavefunction collapse. One of the model's predictions is that
particles "spontaneously" gain energy at a slow rate. When applied to the
excitation of a nucleon in a Ge nucleus, it is shown how a limit on the
relative collapse rates of neutron and proton could be obtained, and a rough
estimate is made from data. When applied to the spontaneous excitation of 1s
electrons in Ge, by a more detailed analysis of more accurate data than
previously given, an updated limit is obtained on the relative collapse rates
of the electron and proton, suggesting that the coupling of the field to
electrons and nucleons is mass proportional.
