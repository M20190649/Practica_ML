Continuity of Relative Entropy of Entanglement
We show that an entanglement measure called relative entropy of entanglement
satisfies a strong continuity condition. If two states are close to each other
then so are their entanglements per particle pair in this measure. It follows
in particular, that the measure is appropriate for the description of
entanglement manipulations in the limit of an infinite number of pairs of
particles.
