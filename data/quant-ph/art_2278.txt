A local hidden variable model of quantum correlation exploiting the
  detection loophole
A local hidden variable model exploiting the detection loophole to reproduce
exactly the quantum correlation of the singlet state is presented. The model is
shown to be compatible with both the CHSH and the CH Bell inequalities.
Moreover, it bears the same rotational symmetry as spins. The reason why the
model can reproduce the quantum correlation without violating the Bell theorem
is that in the model the efficiency of the detectors depends on the local
hidden variable. On average the detector efficiency is limited to 75%.
