Quantum chaos in small quantum networks
We study a 2-spin quantum Turing architecture, in which discrete local
rotations \alpha_m of the Turing head spin alternate with quantum controlled
NOT-operations. We show that a single chaotic parameter input \alpha_m leads to
a chaotic dynamics in the entire Hilbert space. The instability of periodic
orbits on the Turing head and `chaos swapping' onto the Turing tape are
demonstrated explicitly as well as exponential parameter sensitivity of the
Bures metric.
