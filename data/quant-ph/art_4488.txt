Optimal sequence of POVMs in the sense of Stein's lemma in quantum
  hypothesis testing
In this paper, we give another proof of quantum Stein's lemma by calculating
the information spectrum, and study an asymptotic optimal measurement in the
sense of Stein's lemma. We propose a projection measurement characterized by
the irreducible representation theory of the special linear group SL(H).
Specially, in spin 1/2 system, it is realized by a simultaneous measurement of
the total momentum and a momentum of a specified direction.
