A quantum analog of Huffman coding
We analyze a generalization of Huffman coding to the quantum case. In
particular, we notice various difficulties in using instantaneous codes for
quantum communication. Nevertheless, for the storage of quantum information, we
have succeeded in constructing a Huffman-coding inspired quantum scheme. The
number of computational steps in the encoding and decoding processes of N
quantum signals can be made to be of polylogarithmic depth by a massively
parallel implementation of a quantum gate array. This is to be compared with
the O (N^3) computational steps required in the sequential implementation by
Cleve and DiVincenzo of the well-known quantum noiseless block coding scheme of
Schumacher. We also show that O(N^2(log N)^a) computational steps are needed
for the communication of quantum information using another Huffman-coding
inspired scheme where the sender must disentangle her encoding device before
the receiver can perform any measurements on his signals.
