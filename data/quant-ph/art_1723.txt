Instantaneous Spreading and Einstein Causality in Quantum Theory
In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the wave-function of a free particle
which initially is in a finite volume immediately spreads to infinity. In a
nonrelativistic theory this is of no concern, but we show that the same
instantaneous spreading can occur in relativistic quantum theory and that
transition probabilities in widely separated systems may instantaneously become
nonzero. We discuss how this affects Einstein causality.
