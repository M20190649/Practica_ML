Enhancement of Magneto-Optic Effects via Large Atomic Coherence
We utilize the generation of large atomic coherence to enhance the resonant
nonlinear magneto-optic effect by several orders of magnitude, thereby
eliminating power broadening and improving the fundamental signal-to-noise
ratio. A proof-of-principle experiment is carried out in a dense vapor of Rb
atoms. Detailed numerical calculations are in good agreement with the
experimental results. Applications such as optical magnetometry or the search
for violations of parity and time reversal symmetry are feasible.
