Quantum games and quantum algorithms
A quantum algorithm for an oracle problem can be understood as a quantum
strategy for a player in a two-player zero-sum game in which the other player
is constrained to play classically. I formalize this correspondence and give
examples of games (and hence oracle problems) for which the quantum player can
do better than would be possible classically. The most remarkable example is
the Bernstein-Vazirani quantum search algorithm which I show creates no
entanglement at any timestep.
