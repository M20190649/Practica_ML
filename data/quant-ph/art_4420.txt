Towards a tomographic picture of a Bose-Einstein condensate
We investigate by means of numerical simulations the possibilities of
tomographic techniques applied to a Bose-Einstein condensate in order to
reconstruct its ground state. Essentially, two scenarios are considered for
which the density matrix elements can be retrieved from atom counting
probabilities. The methods presented here allow to distinguish among various
possible quantum states.
