Proposal for the Measurement of Bell-like Correlations from Continuous
  Variables
We show theoretically that Bell-type correlations can be observed between
continuous variable measurements performed on a parametric source. An auxiliary
measurement, performed on the detection environment, negates the possibility of
constructing a local realistic description of these correlations.
