Transmitting One Qubit Can Increase One Ebit Between Two Parties at Most
Entanglement shared between two seperated parties could not be increased
without transmitting quantum system. We suggest the project to gain
entanglement shared between Alice and Bob by transmitting quantum system and a
nem scheme to achieve efficient rate of entanglement. It is proven that under
any local operations and communicating classically, to transmit one qubit
through an ideal or a noisy quantum channel can increase no more than one ebit
between two parties. Furthermore, the prior nonmaximally transmitted
entanglement could not be improved by subsequently transmitted qubit. Although
our proof is given in the measure of formation of entanglement, we believe that
the above conclusion is also hold independently of the measure of entanglement.
