Does the quantum collapse make sense? Quantum Mechanics vs
  Multisimultaneity in interferometer-series experiments
It is argued that the three assumptions of quantum collapse, one photon-one
count, and relativity of simultaneity cannot hold together: Nonlocal
correlations can depend on the referential frames of the beam-splitters but not
of the detectors. New experiments using interferometers in series are proposed
which make it possible to test Quantum Mechanics vs Multisimultaneity.
