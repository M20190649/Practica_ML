Coupled Q-oscillators as a model for vibrations of polyatomic molecules
The system of two $Q$-deformed oscillators coupled so that the total
Hamiltonian has the su$_Q$(2) symmetry is proved to be equivalent, to lowest
order approximation, to a system of two identical Morse oscillators coupled by
the cross-anharmonicity usually used empirically in describing vibrational
spectra of triatomic molecules. The symmetry also imposes a connection between
the self-anharmonicity of the Morse oscillators and the cross-anharmonicity
strength, which can be removed by replacing the $Q$-oscillators by deformed
anharmonic oscillators. The generalization to $n$ oscillators is
straightforward. The applicability of the formalism to highly symmetric
polyatomic molecules is discussed.
