Ultracold atoms interacting with a sinusoidal mode of a high-Q cavity
We consider the interaction of two level ultracold atoms resonant with a
sinusoidal mode of the electromagnetic field in a high Q cavity. We found that
well resolved resonances appear in the transmission coefficients even for
actual interaction and cavity parameters. The probability of emission of one
photon and the probability of transmission of an atom, when a number of
coherent states is initially present in the cavity, are discussed. The
interplay between the increasing width of the resonances and multi-peak
steady-state photon-statistics is also studied. Furthermore, we compare our
results with those of a constant field mode.
