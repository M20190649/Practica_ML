Quantum information distribution via entanglement
We present a generalization of quantum teleportation that distributes quantum
information from a sender's $d$-level particle to $N_o$ particles held by
remote receivers via an initially shared multiparticle entangled state. This
entangled state functions as a multiparty quantum information distribution
channel between the sender and the receivers. The structure of the distribution
channel determines how quantum information is processed. Our generalized
teleportation scheme allows multiple receivers at arbitrary locations, and can
be used for applications such as optimal quantum information broadcasting,
asymmetric telecloning, and quantum error correction.
