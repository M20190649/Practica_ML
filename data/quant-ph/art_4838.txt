Coherence and squeezing in superpositions of spin coherent states
We consider the superpositions of spin coherent states and study the
coherence properties and spin squeezing in these states. The spin squeezing is
examined using a new version of spectroscopic squeezing criteria. The results
show that the antibuching effect can be enhanced and spin squeezing can be
generated in the superpositions of two spin coherent states.
