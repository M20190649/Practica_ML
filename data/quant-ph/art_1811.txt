Backward Causation and the EPR Paradox
Backward causation in which future events affect the past is formalized in a
way consistent with Special Relativity and shown to restore locality to
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It can explain the correlations of the EPR
paradox without using hidden variables. It also restores time-symmetry to
microphysics. Quantum Mechanics has the right properties to allow for backward
causation. The new model is probably untestable experimentally but it has
profound philosophical implications concerning reality.
