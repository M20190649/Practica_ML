Partial Factorization of Wave Function for A Quantum Dissipation System
The microscopic approach quantum dissipation process presented by Yu and Sun
[Phys. Rev., A49(1994)592, A51(1995)1845] is developed to analyze the wave
function structure of dynamic evolution of a typical dissipative system, a
single mode boson soaked in a bath of many bosons. In this paper, the wave
function of total system is explicitly obtained as a product of two components
of the system and the bath in the coherent state representation. It not only
describes the influence of the bath on the variable of the system through the
Brownian motion, but also manifests the back- action of the system on the bath
and the effects of the mutual interaction among the bosons of the bath. Due to
the back-action, the total wave function can only be partially factorizable
even for the Brownian motion can be ignored in certain senses, such as the
cases with weak coupling and large detuning
