Localization and diffusion in Ising-type quantum networks
We investigate the effect of phase randomness in Ising-type quantum networks.
These networks model a large class of physical systems. They describe micro-
and nanostructures or arrays of optical elements such as beam splitters
(interferometers) or parameteric amplifiers. Most of these stuctures are
promising candidates for quantum information processing networks. We
demonstrate that such systems exhibit two very distinct types of behaviour. For
certain network configurations (parameters), they show quantum localization
similar to Anderson localization whereas classical stochastic behaviour is
observed in other cases. We relate these findings to the standard theory of
quantum localization.
