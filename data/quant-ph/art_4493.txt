The Precise Formula in a Sine Function Form of the norm of the Amplitude
  and the Necessary and Sufficient Phase Condition for Any Quantum Algorithm
  with Arbitrary Phase Rotations
In this paper we derived the precise formula in a sine function form of the
norm of the amplitude in the desired state, and by means of he precise formula
we presented the necessary and sufficient phase condition for any quantum
algorithm with arbitrary phase rotations. We also showed that the phase
condition: identical rotation angles, is a sufficient but not a necessary phase
condition.
