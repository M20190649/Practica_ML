A Possible New Quantum Algorithm: Arithmetic with Large Integers via the
  Chinese Remainder Theorem
Residue arithmetic is an elegant and convenient way of computing with
integers that exceed the natural word size of a computer. The algorithms are
highly parallel and hence naturally adapted to quantum computation. The process
differs from most quantum algorithms currently under discussion in that the
output would presumably be obtained by classical superposition of the output of
many identical quantum systems, instead of by arranging for constructive
interference in the wave function of a single quantum computer.
