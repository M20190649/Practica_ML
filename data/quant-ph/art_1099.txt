Quantum Mechanical Square Root Speedup in a Structured Search Problem
An unstructured search for one item out of N can be performed quantum
mechanically in time of order square root of N whereas classically this
requires of order N steps. This raises the question of whether square root
speedup persists in problems with more structure. In this note we focus on one
example of a structured problem and find a quantum algorithm which takes time
of order the square root of the classical time.
