On the validity of the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule
It is argued that the proof of Cohen [Phys. Rev. A 51, 4373 (1995)] which
shows that an application of the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule leads to
contradiction with predictions of quantum theory is erroneous. A generalization
of the ABL rule for the case of an incomplete final measurement (which is
needed for the analysis of Cohen's proof) is presented.
