On Quaternions and Monopoles
It is shown that the quaternionic Hilbert space formulation of quantum
mechanics allows a quantization, based on a generalized system of
imprimitivity, that leads to a description of the motion of a quantum particle
in the field of a magnetic monopole. The corresponding Hamilton operator is
linked to the theory of projective representations in the weakened form
proposed by Adler.
