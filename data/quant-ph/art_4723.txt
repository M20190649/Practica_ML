Entanglement, joint measurement, and state reduction
Entanglement is perhaps the most important new feature of the quantum world.
It is expressed in quantum theory by the joint measurement formula. We prove
the formula for self-adjoint observables from a plausible assumption, which for
spacelike separated measurements is an expression of relativistic causality.
State reduction is simply a way to express the JMF after one measurement has
been made, and its result known.
