Quantum state transfer between motion and light
We describe schemes for transferring quantum states between light fields and
the motion of a trapped atom. Coupling between the motion and the light is
achieved via Raman transitions driven by a laser field and the quantized field
of a high-finesse microscopic cavity mode. By cascading two such systems and
tailoring laser field pulses, we show that it is possible to transfer an
arbitrary motional state of one atom to a second atom at a spatially distant
site.
