General Polarization Matrix of Electromagnetic Radiation
A general form of the polarization matrix valid for any type of
electromagnetic radiation (plane waves, multipole radiation etc.) is defined in
terms of a certain bilinear form in the field-strength tensor. The quantum
counterpart is determined as an operator matrix with normal-ordered elements
with respect to the creation and annihilation operators. The zero-point
oscillations (ZPO) of polarization are defined via difference between the
anti-normal and normal ordered operator polarization matrices. It is shown that
ZPO of the multipole field are stronger than those described by the model of
plane waves and are concentrated in a certain neighborhood of a local source.
