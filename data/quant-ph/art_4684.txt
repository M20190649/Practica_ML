Quantum Theory of Observers
This is an attempt to create a consistent and non-trivial extension of
quantum theory, describing in detail the quantum measurement process. A
tentative but concrete model is presented, based on the concept of multiple
observer/participators, represented by separate state vectors. The evolution is
deterministic, and in the chaotic regime implies approximate adherence to the
Born rule for probabilities. The model is applied in a number of contexts:
simple detectors, multi-state selectors, and intermittent systems. The results
are consistent with phenomenology. We also consider more speculative
applications, including specific spin and position `observables.' Finally the
outlook for the model is discussed, and its relation to other work.
