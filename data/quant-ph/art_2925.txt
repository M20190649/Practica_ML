Classicality Criteria
We present two possible criteria quantifying the degree of classicality of an
arbitrary (finite dimensional) dynamical system. The inputs for these criteria
are the classical dynamical structure of the system together with the quantum
and the classical data providing the two alternative descriptions of its
initial time configuration. It is proved that a general quantum system
satisfying the criteria up to some extend displays a time evolution consistent
with the classical predictions up to some degree and thus it is argued that the
criteria provide a suitable measure of classicality. The features of the
formalism are illustrated through two simple examples.
