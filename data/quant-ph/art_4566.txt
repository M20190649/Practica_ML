Semiclassical Explanation of the Matteucci-Pozzi and Aharonov-Bohm Phase
  Shifts
Classical electromagnetic forces can account for the experimentally observed
phase shifts seen in an electron interference pattern when a line of electric
dipoles or a line of magnetic dipoles (a solenoid) is placed between the
electron beams forming the interference pattern.
