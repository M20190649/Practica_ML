Cooling of a mirror by radiation pressure
We describe an experiment in which a mirror is cooled by the radiation
pressure of light. A high-finesse optical cavity with a mirror coated on a
mechanical resonator is used as an optomechanical sensor of the Brownian motion
of the mirror. A feedback mechanism controls this motion via the radiation
pressure of a laser beam reflected on the mirror. We have observed either a
cooling or a heating of the mirror, depending on the gain of the feedback loop.
