Quantum dynamics with two Planck constants and the semiclassical limit
The mathematical possibility of coupling two quantum dynamic systems having
two different Planck constants, respectively, is investigated. It turns out
that such canonical dynamics are always irreversible. Semiclassical dynamics is
obtained by letting one of the two Planck constants go to zero. This
semiclassical dynamics will preserve positivity, as expected, so an improvement
of the earlier proposals by Aleksandrov and by Boucher and Traschen is
achieved. Coupling of quantized matter to gravity is illustrated by a
simplistic example.
