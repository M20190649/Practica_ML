A Supersymmetric Treatment of a Particle Subjected to a Ring-shaped
  Potential
The ring-shaped Hartmann potential $V = \eta \sigma^{2} \epsilon_{0} \left(
\frac{2 a_{0}}{r} - \frac{\eta a_{0}^{2}}{r^{2} sin^{2} \theta} \right)$ was
introduced in quantum chemistry to describe ring-shaped molecules like benzene.
In this article, fundamental concepts of supersymmetric quantum mechanics
(SUSYQM) are discussed.
  The energy eigenvalues and (radial) eigenfunctions of the Hartmann potential
are subsequently rederived using the techniques of SUSYQM.
