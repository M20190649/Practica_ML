Universal quantum computation and simulation using any entangling
  Hamiltonian and local unitaries
What interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a
composite quantum system? We provide an efficient algorithm to simulate any
desired two-body Hamiltonian evolution using any fixed two-body entangling
n-qubit Hamiltonian and local unitaries. It follows that universal quantum
computation can be performed using any entangling interaction and local unitary
operations.
