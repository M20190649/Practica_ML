Geometric Phase, Curvature, and Extrapotentials in Constrained Quantum
  Systems
We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a quantum system constrained to a
submanifold (the constraint manifold) of configuration space (the ambient
space) by an infinite restoring force. We pay special attention to how this
Hamiltonian depends on quantities which are external to the constraint
manifold, such as the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the
(Riemannian) curvature of the ambient space, and the constraining potential. In
particular, we find the remarkable fact that the twisting of the constraining
potential appears as a gauge potential in the constrained Hamiltonian. This
gauge potential is an example of geometric phase, closely related to that
originally discussed by Berry. The constrained Hamiltonian also contains an
effective potential depending on the external curvature of the constraint
manifold, the curvature of the ambient space, and the twisting of the
constraining potential. The general nature of our analysis allows applications
to a wide variety of problems, such as rigid molecules, the evolution of
molecular systems along reaction paths, and quantum strip waveguides.
