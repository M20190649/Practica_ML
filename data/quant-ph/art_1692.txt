A note on the paper, "Quarks or Leptons?"
In the context of a recent description of Fermions as Kerr-Newman type black
holes with Quantum Mechanical inputs, it is shown how the quark picture can be
recovered. The advantage is that in the process we obtain a rationale for such
features as the puzzling fractional charges of the quarks, their masses,
confinement and handedness in a unified scheme.
