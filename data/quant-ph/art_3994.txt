Quantum dynamical properties of a two-photon non-linear Jaynes-Cummings
  model
In this paper we study a two-photon time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model
interacting with a Kerr-like medium. We assumed that the electromagnetic field
is in different states such as coherent, squeezed vacuum and pair coherent, and
that the atom is initially in the excited state. We studied the temporal
evolution of the population of the excited level, and the second order
coherence function. The results obtained show that this system has some
similarities with the two-mode Stark system. We analize two photon entanglement
for different initial conditions.
