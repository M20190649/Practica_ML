Implementing universal multi-qubit quantum logic gates in three and
  four-spin systems at room temperature
In this paper, we present the experimental realization of multi-qubit gates
$% \Lambda_n(not) $ in macroscopic ensemble of three-qubit and four-qubit
molecules. Instead of depending heavily on the two-bit universal gate, which
served as the basic quantum operation in quantum computing, we use pulses of
well-defined frequency and length that simultaneously apply to all qubits in a
quantum register. It appears that this method is experimentally convenient when
this procedure is extended to more qubits on some quantum computation, and it
can also be used in other physical systems.
