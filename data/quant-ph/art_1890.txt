The conditionally exactly solvable potentials: A misunderstanding
  (comment on "Conditionally exactly soluble class of quantum potentials")
In the paper "Conditionally exactly soluble class of quantum potentials" by
A. de Souza Dutra [Phys. Rev. A 47 (1993) R2435] the whole $s-$wave spectrum of
bound states in potentials $V_1(r)=A/r+B/r^{1/2}+G_0/r^2$ with
$G_0=-3\hbar/32\mu$ and $V_2(r)=A r^{2/3}+B/r^{2/3}+g_0/r^2$ with
$g_0=-5\hbar^2/72\mu$ has been constructed in closed form. We show that both
the result and the method of its derivation are not correct.
