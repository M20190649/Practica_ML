Do dynamical reduction models imply that arithmetic does not apply to
  ordinary macroscopic objects?
We analyze a recent paper in which an alleged devastating criticism to the so
called GRW proposal to account for the objectification of the properties of
macroscopic systems has been presented and we show that the author has not
taken into account the precise implications of the GRW theory. This fact makes
his conclusions basically wrong. We also perform a survey of measurement theory
aimed to better focus the physical and the conceptual aspects of the so-called
macro-objectification problem.
