Clifford algebras and universal sets of quantum gates
In this paper is shown an application of Clifford algebras to the
construction of computationally universal sets of quantum gates for $n$-qubit
systems. It is based on the well-known application of Lie algebras together
with the especially simple commutation law for Clifford algebras, which states
that all basic elements either commute or anticommute.
