On bound entanglement assisted distillation
We investigate asymptotic distillation of entanglement in the presence of an
unlimited amount of bound entanglement for bi-partite systems. We show that the
distillability is still bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement. This
offers a strong support to the fact that bound entanglement does not improve
distillation of entanglement.
