Scattering of dislocated wavefronts by vertical vorticity and the
  Aharonov-Bohm effect I: Shallow water
When a surface wave interacts with a vertical vortex in shallow water the
latter induces a dislocation in the incident wavefronts that is analogous to
what happens in the Aharonov-Bohm effect for the scattering of electrons by a
confined magnetic field. In addition to this global similarity between these
two physical systems there is scattering. This paper reports a detailed
calculation of this scattering, which is quantitatively different from the
electronic case in that a surface wave penetrates the inside of a vortex while
electrons do not penetrate a solenoid. This difference, together with an
additional difference in the equations that govern both physical systems lead
to a quite different scattering in the case of surface waves, whose main
characteristic is a strong asymmetry in the scattering cross section. The
assumptions and approximations under which these effects happen are carefully
considered, and their applicability to the case of scattering of acoustic waves
by vorticity is noted.
