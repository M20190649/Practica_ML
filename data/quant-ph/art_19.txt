Sub-femtosecond determination of transmission delay times for a
  dielectric mirror (photonic bandgap) as a function of angle of incidence
Using a two-photon interference technique, we measure the delay for
single-photon wavepackets to be transmitted through a multilayer dielectric
mirror, which functions as a ``photonic bandgap'' medium. By varying the angle
of incidence, we are able to confirm the behavior predicted by the group delay
(stationary phase approximation), including a variation of the delay time from
superluminal to subluminal as the band edge is tuned towards to the wavelength
of our photons. The agreement with theory is better than 0.5 femtoseconds (less
than one quarter of an optical period) except at large angles of incidence. The
source of the remaining discrepancy is not yet fully understood.
