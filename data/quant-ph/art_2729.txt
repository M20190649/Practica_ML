On mechanisms that enforce complementarity
In a recent publication Luis and Sanchez-Soto arrive at the conclusion that
complementarity is universally enforced by random classical phase kicks. We
disagree. One could just as well argue that quantum entanglement is the
universal mechanism. Both claims of universality are unjustified, however.
