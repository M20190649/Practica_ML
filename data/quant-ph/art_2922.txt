Comment on the Adiabatic Condition
The experimental observation of effects due to Berry's phase in quantum
systems is certainly one of the most impressive demonstrations of the
correctness of the superposition principle in quantum mechanics. Since Berry's
original paper in 1984, the spin 1/2 coupled with rotating external magnetic
field has been one of the most studied models where those phases appear. We
also consider a special case of this soluble model. A detailed analysis of the
coupled differential equations and comparison with exact results teach us why
the usual procedure (of neglecting nondiagonal terms) is mathematically sound.
