Teleportation via generalized measurements, and conclusive teleportation
In this work we show that teleportation is a special case of a generalized
Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen (EPR) non-locality. Based on the connection between
teleportation and generalized measurements we define conclusive teleportation.
We show that perfect conclusive teleportation can be obtained with any pure
entangled state, and it can be arbitrarily approached with a particular mixed
state.
