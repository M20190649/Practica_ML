Criteria for Continuous-Variable Quantum Teleportation
We derive an experimentally testable criterion for the teleportation of
quantum states of continuous variables. This criterion is especially relevant
to the recent experiment of Furusawa et al. [Science 282, 706-709 (1998)] where
an input-output fidelity of $0.58 \pm 0.02$ was achieved for optical coherent
states. Our derivation demonstrates that fidelities greater than 1/2 could not
have been achieved through the use of a classical channel alone; quantum
entanglement was a crucial ingredient in the experiment.
