Quasi-classical dynamics of interacting Bose condensates
The dynamics of the composition of uniform Bose condensates involving two
species capable of reciprocal interconversion is treated in terms of a
collective quasi-spin model. This collective model quickly reduces to classical
form towards the thermodynamic limit. Quantum solutions are easily obtained
numerically short of this limit which give insight into the dynamically
relevant correlation processes.
