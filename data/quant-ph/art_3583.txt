Multipartite generalisation of the Schmidt decomposition
We find a canonical form for pure states of a general multipartite system, in
which the constraints on the coordinates (with respect to a factorisable
orthonormal basis) are simply that certain ones vanish and certain others are
real. For identical particles they are invariant under permutations of the
particles. As an application, we find the dimension of the generic local
equivalence class.
