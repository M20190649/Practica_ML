Entanglement quantification and purification in continuous variable
  systems
We develop theoretical and numerical tools for the quantification of
entanglement in systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Continuous variable
entanglement swapping is introduced and based on this idea we develop methods
of entanglement purification for continuous variable systems. The success of
these entanglement purification methods is then assessed using these tools.
