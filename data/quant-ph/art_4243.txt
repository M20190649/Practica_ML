Four-photon Entanglement as Stochastic-signal Correlation
A fully classical model of a recent experiment exhibiting what is interpreted
as teleportation and four-photon entanglement is described. It is shown that
the reason that a classical model is possible, contrary to the current belief,
results ultimately from a misguided modification by Bohm of the EPR Gedanken
experiment. Finally, teleportation is reinterpreted as the passive filtration
of correlated but stochastic events in stead of the active transfer of either
material or information.
