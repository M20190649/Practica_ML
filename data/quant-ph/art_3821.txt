Comment on "Quantum key distribution without alternative measurements"
In a recent paper [A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. A 61, 052312 (2000)], a quantum key
distribution protocol based on entanglement swapping was proposed. However, in
this comment, it is shown that this protocol is insecure if Eve use a special
strategy to attack.
