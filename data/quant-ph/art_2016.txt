High-sensitivity optical measurement of mechanical Brownian motion
We describe an experiment in which a laser beam is sent into a high-finesse
optical cavity with a mirror coated on a mechanical resonator. We show that the
reflected light is very sensitive to small mirror displacements. We have
observed the Brownian motion of the resonator with a very high sensitivity.
