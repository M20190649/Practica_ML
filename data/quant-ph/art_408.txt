Quantum Adiabatic Approximation, Quantum Action, and Berry's Phase
An alternative interpretation of the quantum adiabatic approximation is
presented. This interpretation is based on the ideas originally advocated by
David Bohm in his quest for establishing a hidden variable alternative to
quantum mechanics. It indicates that the validity of the quantum adiabatic
approximation is a sufficient condition for the separability of the quantum
action function in the time variable. The implications of this interpretation
for Berry's adiabatic phase and its semi-classical limit are also discussed.
