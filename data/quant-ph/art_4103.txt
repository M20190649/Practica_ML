On a Lie algebraic approach of quasi-exactly solvable potentials with
  two known eigenstates
We compare two recent approaches of quasi-exactly solvable Schr\" odinger
equations, the first one being related to finite-dimensional representations of
$sl(2,R)$ while the second one is based on supersymmetric developments. Our
results are then illustrated on the Razavy potential, the sextic oscillator and
a scalar field model.
