Relativistic properties of marginal distributions
We study the properties of marginal distributions-projections of the phase
space representation of a physical system-under relativistic transforms. We
consider the Galileo case as well as the Lorentz transforms exploiting the
relativistic oscillator model used for describing the mass spectrum of
elementary particles.
