Quantum Data Hiding
We expand on our work on Quantum Data Hiding -- hiding classical data among
parties who are restricted to performing only local quantum operations and
classical communication (LOCC). We review our scheme that hides one bit between
two parties using Bell states, and we derive upper and lower bounds on the
secrecy of the hiding scheme. We provide an explicit bound showing that
multiple bits can be hidden bitwise with our scheme. We give a preparation of
the hiding states as an efficient quantum computation that uses at most one
ebit of entanglement. A candidate data hiding scheme that does not use
entanglement is presented. We show how our scheme for quantum data hiding can
be used in a conditionally secure quantum bit commitment scheme.
