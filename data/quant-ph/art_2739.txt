Reduced phase space quantization
We examine two singular Lagrangian systems with constraints which apparently
reduce the phase space to a 2-dimensional sphere and a 2-dimensional
hyperboloid. Rigorous constraint analysis by Dirac's method, however, gives
2-dimensional open disc and an infinite plane with a hole in the centre
respectively as the reduced phase spaces. Upon canonical quantisation the
classical constraints show up as restrictions on the Hilbert space.
