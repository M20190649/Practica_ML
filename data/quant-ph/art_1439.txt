The Piecewise Deterministic Process Associated to EEQT
In the framework of Event Enhanced Quantum Theory (EEQT) a probabilistic
construction of the piecewise deterministic process associated with a dynamical
semigroup is presented. The process generates sample histories of individual
systems quantums systems continuously coupled to classical measuring devices;
it gives a unique algorithm generating time series of pointer readings in real
experiments with quantum systems.
