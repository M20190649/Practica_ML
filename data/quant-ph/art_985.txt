Unusual light spectra from a two-level atom in squeezed vacuum
We investigate the interaction of an atom with a multi-channel squeezed
vacuum. It turns out that the light coming out in a particular channel can have
anomalous spectral properties, among them asymmetry of the spectrum, absence of
the central peak as well as central hole burning for particular parameters. As
an example plane-wave squeezing is considered. In this case the above phenomena
can occur for the light spectra in certain directions. In the total spectrum
these phenomena are washed out.
