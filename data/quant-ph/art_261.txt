Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform and Decoherence
We discuss the advantages of using the approximate quantum Fourier transform
(AQFT) in algorithms which involve periodicity estimations. We analyse quantum
networks performing AQFT in the presence of decoherence and show that extensive
approximations can be made before the accuracy of AQFT (as compared with
regular quantum Fourier transform) is compromised. We show that for some
computations an approximation may imply a better performance.
