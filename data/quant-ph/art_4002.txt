Quantum mechanics vs. local realism, is that the question?
The conjecture is made that quantum mechanics is compatible with local hidden
variables (or local realism). The conjecture seems to be ruled out by the
theoretical argument of Bell, but it is supported by the empirical fact that
nobody has been able to perform a loophole-free test of local realism in spite
of renewed effort during almost 40 years.
