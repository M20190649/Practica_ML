Losing Your Marbles in Wavefunction Collapse Theories
Peter Lewis ([1997]) has recently argued that the wavefunction collapse
theory of GRW (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber [1986]) can only solve the problem
of wavefunction tails at the expense of predicting that arithmetic does not
apply to ordinary macroscopic objects. More specifically, Lewis argues that the
GRW theory must violate the enumeration principle: that `if marble 1 is in the
box and marble 2 is in the box and so on through marble $n$, then all $n$
marbles are in the box' ([1997], p. 321). Ghirardi and Bassi ([1999]) have
replied that it is meaningless to say that the enumeration principle is
violated because the wavefunction Lewis uses to exhibit the violation cannot
persist, according to the GRW theory, for more than a split second ([1999], p.
709). On the contrary, we argue that Lewis's argument survives Ghirardi and
Bassi's criticism unscathed. We then go on to show that, while the enumeration
principle can fail in the GRW theory, the theory itself guarantees that the
principle can never be empirically falsified, leaving the applicability of
arithmetical reasoning to both micro- and macroscopic objects intact.
