Quantum Mechanics as a Principle Theory
I show how quantum mechanics, like the theory of relativity, can be
understood as a 'principle theory' in Einstein's sense, and I use this notion
to explore the approach to the problem of interpretation developed in my book
Interpreting the Quantum World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999).
