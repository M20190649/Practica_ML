On hybrid dynamics of the Copenhagen dichotomic world
In the Copenhagen viewpoint, part of the world is quantized and the
complementary part remains classical. From a formal dynamic aspect, standard
theory is incomplete since it does never account for the so-called
'back-reaction' of quantized systems on classical systems except for the highly
idealized system-detector interaction. To resolve this formal issue, a certain
'hybrid dynamics' can be constructed to account for the generic interaction
between classical and quantized parts. Hybrid dynamics incorporates standard
quantum theory, including collapse of the wave function during system-detector
interaction. Measurable predictions are robust against shifting the
classical-quantum boundary (von Neumann-cut).
