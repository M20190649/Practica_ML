Use of Mathematical Logical Concepts in Quantum Mechanics: An Example
The representation of numbers by product states in quantum mechanics can be
extended to the representation of words and word sequences in languages by
product states. This can be used to study quantum systems that generate text
that has meaning. A simple example of such a system, based on an example
described by Smullyan, is studied here. Based on a path interpretation for some
word states, definitions of truth, validity, consistency and completeness are
given and their properties studied. It is also shown that the relation between
the meaning, if any, of word states and the algorithmic complexity of the
process generating the states must be quite complex or nonexistent.
