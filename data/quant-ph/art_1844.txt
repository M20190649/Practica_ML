Quantum limit of decoherence: Environment induced superselection of
  energy eigenstates
We investigate decoherence in the limit where the interaction with the
environment is weak and the evolution is dominated by the self Hamiltonian of
the system. We show that in this case quantized eigenstates of energy emerge as
pointer states selected through the predictability sieve.
