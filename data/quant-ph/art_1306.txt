Solvable three boson model with attractive delta function interactions
A one parameter solvable model for three bosons subject to delta function
interactions in one-dimension with periodic boundary conditions is studied. The
energy levels and wave functions are classified and given explicitly in terms
of three momenta. In particular, eigenstates and eigenvalues are described as
functions of the model parameter, c. Some of the states are given in terms of
complex momenta and represent dimer or trimer configurations for large negative
c. The asymptotic behaviour for small and large values of the parameter, and at
thresholds between real and complex momenta is provided. The properties of the
potential energy are also discussed.
