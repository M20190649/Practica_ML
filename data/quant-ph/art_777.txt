Phase preparation by atom counting of Bose-Einstein condensates in mixed
  states
We study the build up of quantum coherence between two Bose-Einstein
condensates which are initially in mixed states. We consider in detail the two
cases where each condensate is initially in a thermal or a Poisson distribution
of atom number. Although initially there is no relative phase between the
condensates, a sequence of spatial atom detections produces an interference
pattern with arbitrary but fixed relative phase. The visibility of this
interference pattern is close to one for the Poisson distribution of two
condensates with equal counting rates but it becomes a stochastic variable in
the thermal case, where the visibility will vary from run to run around an
average visibility of $\pi /4.$ In both cases, the variance of the phase
distribution is inversely proportional to the number of atom detections in the
regime where this number is large compared to one but small compared with the
total number of atoms in the condensates.
