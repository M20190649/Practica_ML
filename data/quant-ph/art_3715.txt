Addition on a Quantum Computer
A new method for computing sums on a quantum computer is introduced. This
technique uses the quantum Fourier transform and reduces the number of qubits
necessary for addition by removing the need for temporary carry bits. This
approach also allows the addition of a classical number to a quantum
superposition without encoding the classical number in the quantum register.
This method also allows for massive parallelization in its execution.
