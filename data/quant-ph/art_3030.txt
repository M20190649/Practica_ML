An Approach to Measurement by Quantum-Stochastic-Parameter Averaged
  Bohmian Mechanics
A coarse-grained quantum operator technique is used along with the formalism
of Bohmian mechanics endowed with stochastic character at the quantum level in
order to address some central issues in the quantum theory of measurement. A
surprisingly simple picture of decoherence and EPR correlations emerges from
its use.
