The Quantum Entanglement of Binary and Bipolar Sequences
Classification of different forms of quantum entanglement is an active area
of research, central to development of effective quantum computers, and similar
to classification of error-correction codes, where code duality is broadened to
equivalence under all 'local' unitary transforms. We explore links between
entanglement, coding theory, and sequence design, by examining multi-spectra of
quantum states under local unitary action, and show that optimal
error-correcting codes and sequences represent states with high multiparticle
entanglement.
