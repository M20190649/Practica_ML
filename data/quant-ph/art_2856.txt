Motional Squashed States
We show that by using a feedback loop it is possible to reduce the
fluctuations in one quadrature of the vibrational degree of freedom of a
trapped ion below the quantum limit. The stationary state is not a proper
squeezed state, but rather a ``squashed'' state, since the uncertainty in the
orthogonal quadrature, which is larger than the standard quantum limit, is
unaffected by the feedback action.
