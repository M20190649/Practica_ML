Adiabatic Berry Phase and Hannay Angle for Open Paths
We obtain the adiabatic Berry phase by defining a generalised gauge potential
whose line integral gives the phase holonomy for arbitrary evolutions of
parameters. Keeping in mind that for classical integrable systems it is hardly
clear how to obtain open-path Hannay angle, we establish a connection between
the open-path Berry phase and Hannay angle by using the parametrised coherent
state approach. Using the semiclassical wavefunction we analyse the open-path
Berry phase and obtain the open-path Hannay angle. Further, by expressing the
adiabatic Berry phase in terms of the commutator of instantaneous projectors
with its differential and using Wigner representation of operators we obtain
the Poisson bracket between distribution function and its differential. This
enables us to talk about the classical limit of the phase holonomy which yields
the angle holonomy for open-paths. An operational definition of Hannay angle is
provided based on the idea of classical limit of quantum mechanical inner
product. A probable application of the open-path Berry phase and Hannay angle
to wave-packet revival phenomena is also pointed out.
