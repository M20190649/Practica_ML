Quantization of a Constant of Motion for the Harmonic Oscillator with a
  Time-Explicitly Depending Force
The quantization of a constant of motion for the harmonic oscillator with a
time-explicitly depending external force is carried out. This quantization
approach is compared with the normal Hamiltonian quantization approach.
Numerical results show that there are qualitative and quantitative differences
for both approaches, suggesting that the quantization of this constant of
motion may be verified experimentally.
