Algebraic Approach to Shape Invariance
The integrability condition called shape invariance is shown to have an
underlying algebraic structure and the associated Lie algebras are identified.
These shape-invariance algebras transform the parameters of the potentials such
as strength and range. Shape-invariance algebras, in general, are shown to be
infinite-dimensional. The conditions under which they become finite-dimensional
are explored.
