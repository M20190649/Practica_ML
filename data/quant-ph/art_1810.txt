Bell's theorem, quantum mechanical non-locality and atomic cascade
  photons
Bell's theorem of 1965 is a proof that all realistic interpretations of
quantum mechanics must be non-local. Bell's theorem consists of two parts:
first a correlation inequality is derived that must be satisfied by all local
realistic theories; second it is demonstrated that quantum mechanical
probabilities violate this inequality in certain cases. In the case of ideal
experiments, Bell's theorem has been proven. However, in the case of real
experiments where polarizers and detectors are non-ideal, the theorem has not
yet been proven since the proof always requires some arbitrary and {\em ad hoc}
supplementary assumptions. In this paper, we state a new and rather weak
supplementary assumption for the ensemble of photons that emerge from the
polarizers, and we show that the conjunction of Einstein's locality with this
assumption leads to validity of an inequality that is violated by a factor as
large as 1.5 in the case of real experiments. Moreover, the present
supplementary assumption is considerably weaker and more general than Clauser,
Horne, Shimony, Holt supplementary assumption.
