The entanglement fidelity and quantum error correction
Two new expressions for the entanglement fidelity recently introduced by
Schumacher (LANL e-print quant-ph/9604023, to appear in Phys. Rev. A) are
derived. These expressions show that it is the entanglement fidelity which must
be maximized when performing error correction on qubits for quantum computers,
not the fidelity, which is the most-often used generalization of the
probability for storing a qubit correctly.
