Non-thermal nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computing using
  hyperpolarized Xenon
Current experiments in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance quantum
computing are limited by low initial polarization. To address this problem, we
have investigated the use of optical pumping techniques to enhance the
polarization of a 2-qubit NMR quantum computer (13C and 1H in 13CHCl3). To
efficiently use the increased polarization, we have generalized the procedure
for effective pure state preparation. With this new, more flexible scheme, an
effective pure state was prepared with polarization-enhancement of a factor of
10 compared to the thermal state. An implementation of Grover's quantum search
algorithm was demonstrated using this new technique.
