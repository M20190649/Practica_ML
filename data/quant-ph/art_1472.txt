On a Resolution of the Identity in Terms of Coherent States
Transformations of coherent states of the free particle by bounded and
semibounded symmetry operators are considered. Resolution of the identity
operator in terms of the transformed states is analyzed. A generalized identity
resolution is formulated. Darboux transformation operators are analyzed as
operators defined in a Hilbert space. Coherent states of multisoliton
potentials are studied.
