Elementary Particles in a New Quantum Scheme
Proceeding from the main principles of the non-unitary quantum theory of
relativistic bi-Hamiltonian systems, a system of Lagrangian fields
characterized by a certain dispersion law (mass spectrum of particles),
interactions between them and their coupling constants are constructed. In this
article the mass spectrum formula for ``bare'' fundamental hadrons is
introduced, and an a priori normalization of particle fields is found as well.
Numerical values of some parameters of the present theory are determined.
