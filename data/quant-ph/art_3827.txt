Quantum propagators in a random metric
We consider second order differential operators with coefficients which are
Gaussian random fields. When the covariance becomes singular at short distances
then the propagators of the Schr\"odinger equation as well as of the wave
equation behave in an anomalous way. In particular, the Feynman propagator for
the wave equation is less singular than the one with deterministic
coefficients. We suggest some applications to quantum gravity.
