Quantum Error Correction by Coding
Recent progress in quantum cryptography and quantum computers has given hope
to their imminent practical realization. An essential element at the heart of
the application of these quantum systems is a quantum error correction scheme.
We propose a new technique based on the use of coding in order to detect and
correct errors due to imperfect transmission lines in quantum cryptography or
memories in quantum computers. We give a particular example of how to detect a
decohered qubit in order to transmit or preserve with high fidelity the
original qubit.
