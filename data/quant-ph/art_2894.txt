Classical Capacity of A Quantum Multiple Access Channel
We consider the transmission of classical information over a quantum channel
by two senders. The channel capacity region is shown to be a convex hull bound
by the Von Neumann entropy and the conditional Von Neumann entropy. We discuss
some possible applications of our result. We also show that our scheme allows a
reasonable distribution of channel capacity over two senders.
