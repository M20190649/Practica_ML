Quantum theory of fluctuations in a cold damped accelerometer
We present a quantum network approach to real high sensitivity measurements.
Thermal and quantum fluctuations due to active as well as passive elements are
taken into account. The method is applied to the analysis of the capacitive
accelerometer using the cold damping technique, developed for fundamental
physics in space by ONERA and the ultimate limits of this instrument are
discussed. It is confirmed in this quantum analysis that the cold damping
technique allows one to control efficiently the test mass motion without
degrading the noise level.
