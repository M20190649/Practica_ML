Quantum limits and symphotonic states in free-mass gravitational-wave
  antennae
Quantum mechanics sets severe limits on the sensitivity and required
circulating energy in traditional free-mass gravitational-wave antennas. One
possible way to avoid these restrictions is the use of intracavity QND
measurements. We analyze a new QND observable, which possesses a number of
features that make it a promising candidate for such measurements and propose a
practical scheme for the realization of this measurement. In combination with
an advanced coordinate meter, this scheme makes it possible to lower
substantially the requirements on the circulating power.
