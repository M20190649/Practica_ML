Characterisation of an entanglement-free evolution
Two or more quantum systems are said to be in an entangled or
non-factorisable state if their joint (supposedly pure) wave-function is not
expressible as a product of individual wave functions but is instead a
superposition of product states. It is only when the systems are in a
factorisable state that they can be considered to be separated (in the sense of
Bell). We show that whenever two quantum systems interact with each other, it
is impossible that all factorisable states remain factorisable during the
interaction unless the full Hamiltonian does not couple these systems so to say
unless they do not really interact. We also present certain conditions under
which particular factorisable states remain factorisable although they
represent a bipartite system whose components mutually interact and pay a
particular attention to the case where the two particles interact mutually
through an action at a distance in the three dimensional space.
