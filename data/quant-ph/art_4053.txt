Low energy atomic collision with dipole interactions
We apply quantum defect theory to study low energy ground state atomic
collisions including aligned dipole interactions such as those induced by an
electric field. Our results show that coupled even ($l$) relative orbital
angular momentum partial wave channels exhibit shape resonance structures while
odd ($l$) channels do not. We analyze and interpret these resonances within the
framework of multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT).
