Test of quantum nonlocality for cavity fields
There have been studies on formation of quantum-nonlocal states in spatially
separate two cavities. We suggest a nonlocal test for the field prepared in the
two cavities. We couple classical driving fields with the cavities where a
nonlocal state is prepared. Two independent two-level atoms are then sent
through respective cavities to interact off-resonantly with the cavity fields.
The atomic states are measured after the interaction. Bell's inequality can be
tested by the joint probabilities of two-level atoms being in their excited or
ground states. We find that quantum nonlocality can also be tested using a
single atom sequentially interacting with the two cavities. Potential
experimental errors are also considered. We show that with the present
experimental condition of 5% error in the atomic velocity distribution, the
violation of Bell's inequality can be measured.
