Atomic position localization via dual measurement
We study localization of atomic position when a three-level atom interacts
with a quantized standing-wave field in the Ramsey interferometer setup. Both
the field quadrature amplitude and the atomic internal state are measured to
obtain the atomic position information. It is found that this dual measurement
scheme produces an interference pattern superimposed on a diffraction-like
pattern in the atomic position distribution, where the former pattern
originates from the state-selective measurement and the latter from the field
measurement. The present scheme results in a better resolution in the position
localization than the field-alone measurement schemes. We also discuss the
measurement-correlated mechanical action of the standing-wave field on the atom
in the light of Popper's test.
