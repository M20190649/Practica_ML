Autofeedback scheme for preservation of macroscopic coherence in
  microwave cavities
We present a scheme for controlling the decoherence of a linear superposition
of two coherent states with opposite phases in a high-Q microwave cavity, based
on the injection of appropriately prepared ``probe'' and ``feedback'' Rydberg
atoms, improving the one presented in [D. Vitali et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 79,
2442 (1997)]. In the present scheme, the information transmission from the
probe to the feedback atom is directly mediated by a second auxiliary cavity.
The detection efficiency for the probe atom is no longer a critical parameter,
and the decoherence time of the superposition state can be significantly
increased using presently available technology.
