Quantum neural network
It is suggested that a quantum neural network (QNN), a type of artificial
neural network, can be built using the principles of quantum information
processing. The input and output qubits in the QNN can be implemented by
optical modes with different polarization, the weights of the QNN can be
implemented by optical beam splitters and phase shifters
