Teleportation as a Depolarizing Quantum Channel, Relative Entropy and
  Classical Capacity
We show that standard teleportation with an arbitrary mixed state resource is
equivalent to a generalized depolarizing channel with probabilities given by
the maximally entangled components of the resource. This enables the usage of
any quantum channel as a generalized depolarizing channel without additional
twirling operations. It also provides a nontrivial upper bound on the
entanglement of a class of mixed states. Our result allows a consistent and
statistically motivated quantification of teleportation success in terms of the
relative entropy and this quantification can be related to a classical
capacity.
