A Tentative Expression of the Karolyhazy Uncertainty of the Space-Time
  Structure through Vacuum Spreads in Quantum Gravity
In the existing expositions of the Karolyhazy model, quantum mechanical
uncertainties are mimicked by classical spreads. It is shown how to express
those uncertainties through entities of the future unified theory of general
relativity and quantum theory.
