On Using Quantum Protocols to Detect Traffic Analysis
We consider the problem of detecting whether an attacker measures the amount
of traffic sent over a communication channel-possibly without extracting
information about the transmitted data. A basic approach for designing a
quantum protocol for detecting a perpetual traffic analysis of this kind is
described.
