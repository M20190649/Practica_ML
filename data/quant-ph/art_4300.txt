Long-distance quantum communication with atomic ensembles and linear
  optics
Quantum communication holds a promise for absolutely secure transmission of
secret messages and faithful transfer of unknown quantum states. Photonic
channels appear to be very attractive for physical implementation of quantum
communication. However, due to losses and decoherence in the channel, the
communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. We
describe a scheme that allows to implement robust quantum communication over
long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic
ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate
efficiencies, and therefore well fits the status of the current experimental
technology. We show that the communication efficiency scale polynomially with
the channel length thereby facilitating scalability to very long distances.
