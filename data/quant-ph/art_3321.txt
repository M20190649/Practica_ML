Teleportation using coupled oscillator states
We analyse the fidelity of teleportation protocols, as a function of resource
entanglement, for three kinds of two mode oscillator states: states with fixed
total photon number, number states entangled at a beam splitter, and the
two-mode squeezed vacuum state. We define corresponding teleportation protocols
for each case including phase noise to model degraded entanglement of each
resource.
