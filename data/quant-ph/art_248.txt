Comment on ``Quantum Phase of Induced Dipoles Moving in a Magnetic
  Field''
It has recently been suggested that an Aharonov-Bohm phase should be capable
of detection using beams of neutral polarizable particles. A more careful
analysis of the proposed experiment suffices to show, however, that it cannot
be performed regardless of the strength of the external electric and magnetic
fields.
