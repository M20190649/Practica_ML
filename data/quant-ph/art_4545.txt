How to share a continuous-variable quantum secret by optical
  interferometry
We develop the theory of continuous-variable quantum secret sharing and
propose its interferometric realization using passive and active optical
elements. In the ideal case of infinite squeezing, a fidelity ${\cal F}$ of
unity can be achieved with respect to reconstructing the quantum secret. We
quantify the reduction in fidelity for the (2,3) threshold scheme due to finite
squeezing and establish the condition for verifying that genuine quantum secret
sharing has occurred.
