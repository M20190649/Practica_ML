On the Number of Elements Needed in a POVM Attaining the Accessible
  Information
We investigate a symmetric set of three quantum states in three dimensions
having interesting properties, which we call the lifted trine states. We show
that for the ensemble consisting of the three lifted trine states taken with
equal probabilities, the POVM measurement realizing the accessible information
must contain six projectors, giving a counterexample to a conjecture of
Levitin.
