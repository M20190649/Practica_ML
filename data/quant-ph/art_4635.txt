Universal quantum computation using only projective measurement, quantum
  memory, and preparation of the 0 state
What resources are universal for quantum computation? In the standard model,
a quantum computer consists of a sequence of unitary gates acting coherently on
the qubits making up the computer. This paper shows that a very different model
involving only projective measurements, quantum memory, and the ability to
prepare the |0> state is also universal for quantum computation. In particular,
no coherent unitary dynamics are involved in the computation.
