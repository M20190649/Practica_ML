Conditionally Exactly Solvable Potentials and Supersymmetric
  Transformations
A general procedure is presented to construct conditionally solvable (CES)
potentials using the techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.The method
is illustrated with potentials related to the harmonic oscillator
problem.Besides recovering known results,new CES potentials are also obtained
within the framework of this general approach.The conditions under which this
method leads to CES potentials are also discussed.
