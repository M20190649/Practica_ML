A Numerical Investigation of the Effects of Classical Phase Space
  Structure on a Quantum System
We present a detailed numerical study of a chaotic classical system and its
quantum counterpart. The system is a special case of a kicked rotor and for
certain parameter values possesses cantori dividing chaotic regions of the
classical phase space. We investigate the diffusion of particles through a
cantorus; classical diffusion is observed but quantum diffusion is only
significant when the classical phase space area escaping through the cantorus
per kicking period greatly exceeds Planck's constant. A quantum analysis
confirms that the cantori act as barriers. We numerically estimate the
classical phase space flux through the cantorus per kick and relate this
quantity to the behaviour of the quantum system. We introduce decoherence via
environmental interactions with the quantum system and observe the subsequent
increase in the transport of quantum particles through the boundary.
