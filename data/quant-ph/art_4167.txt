The hidden cost of quantum teleportation and remote state preparation
The amount of information transferred during standard quantum teleportation
or remote state preparation is equal to the preparation information of the
transmitted state, rather than the classical communication required by
respective protocol. This is shown by noting that the information required to
specify the operation that verifies the transmitted state is identical to the
preparation information, at the given level of precision m (in bits). Depending
on the resolution of the projective Hilbert space, the preparation information
can be made arbitrarily precise and hence indefinitely larger than the
classical communication cost. Therefore, the classical communication is
insufficient to account for the transfer of preparation information, which is
then attributed to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channel. Some fundamental
repercussions for relativistic quantum information processing are briefly
discussed.
