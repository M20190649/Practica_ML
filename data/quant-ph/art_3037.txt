Causality and probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
It is shown that probabilistic treatment of quantum mechanics can be
coordinated with causality of all physical processes. The physical
interpretation of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as process of measurement
and collapse of quantum state is given.
