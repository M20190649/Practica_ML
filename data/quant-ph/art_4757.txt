A nonlocal classical perspective on quantum electrodynamics
The ideas behind the nonlocal classical statistical field theory model for
the quantized Klein-Gordon field introduced in Morgan(2001, quant-ph/0106141)
are extended to accommodate quantum electrodynamics. The anticommutation rules
for the quantized Dirac spinor field are given a classical interpretation as a
relativistically covariant modification of the minimal coupling interaction
between the classical electromagnetic field and a classical Dirac spinor field.
