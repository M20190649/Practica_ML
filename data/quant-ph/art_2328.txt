Exactly solvable path integral for open cavities in terms of quasinormal
  modes
We evaluate the finite-temperature Euclidean phase-space path integral for
the generating functional of a scalar field inside a leaky cavity. Provided the
source is confined to the cavity, one can first of all integrate out the fields
on the outside to obtain an effective action for the cavity alone.
Subsequently, one uses an expansion of the cavity field in terms of its
quasinormal modes (QNMs)-the exact, exponentially damped eigenstates of the
classical evolution operator, which previously have been shown to be complete
for a large class of models. Dissipation causes the effective cavity action to
be nondiagonal in the QNM basis. The inversion of this action matrix inherent
in the Gaussian path integral to obtain the generating functional is therefore
nontrivial, but can be accomplished by invoking a novel QNM sum rule. The
results are consistent with those obtained previously using canonical
quantization.
