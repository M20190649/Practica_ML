Exact derivation of the Langevin and master equations for harmonic
  quantum Brownian motion
A many particle Hamiltonian, where the interaction term conserves the number
of particles, is considered. A master equation for the populations of the
different levels is derived in an exact way. It results in a local equation
with time-dependent coefficients, which can be identified with the transition
probabilities in the golden rule approximation. A reinterpretation of the model
as a set of coupled harmonic oscillators enables one to obtain for one of them
an exact local Langevin equation, with time-dependent coefficients.
