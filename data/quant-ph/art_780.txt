Stochastically positive structures on Weyl algebras. The case of
  quasi-free states
We consider quasi-free stochastically positive ground and thermal states on
Weyl algebras in Euclidean time formulation. In particular, we obtain a new
derivation of a general form of thermal quasi-free state and give conditions
when such state is stochastically positive i.e. when it defines periodic
stochastic process with respect to Euclidean time, so called thermal process.
Then we show that thermal process completely determines modular structure
canonically associated with quasi-free state on Weyl algebra. We discuss a
variety of examples connected with free field theories on globally hyperbolic
stationary space-times and models of quantum statistical mechanics.
