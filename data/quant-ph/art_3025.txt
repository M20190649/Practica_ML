Quantum key distribution relied on trusted information center
Quantum correlation between two particles and among three particles show
nonclassic properties that can be used for providing secure transmission of
information. In this paper, we propose two quantum key distribution schemes for
quantum cryptographic network, which use the correlation properties of two and
three particles. One is implemented by the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state,
and another is implemented by the Bell states. These schemes need a trusted
information center like that in the classic cryptography. The optimal
efficiency of the proposed protocols are higher than that in the previous
schemes.
