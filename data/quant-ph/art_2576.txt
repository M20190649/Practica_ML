Universal teleportation with a twist
We give a transfer theorem for teleportation based on twisting the
entanglement measurement. This allows one to say what local unitary operation
must be performed to complete the teleportation in any situation, generalizing
the scheme to include overcomplete measurements, non-abelian groups of local
unitary operations (e.g., angular momentum teleportation), and the effect of
non-maximally entangled resources.
