Quantum origin of classical properties within the modal interpretations
An example is presented when decoherence and quantum interference gives rise
to narrow eigenstates (in coordinate representation) for the reduced density
matrix of macroscopic quantum systems. On the basis of modal interpretations
this means the emergence of classical properties.
