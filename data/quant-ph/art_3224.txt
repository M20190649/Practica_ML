Dynamics of Nonlocality for A Two-Mode Squeezed State in Thermal
  Environment
We investigate the time evolution of nonlocality for a two-mode squeezed
state in the thermal environment. The initial two-mode pure squeezed state is
nonlocal with a stronger nonlocality for a larger degree of squeezing. It is
found that the larger the degree of initial squeezing is, the more rapidly the
squeezed state loses its nonlocality. We explain this by the rapid destruction
of quantum coherence for the strongly squeezed state.
