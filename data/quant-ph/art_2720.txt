Quantum State Reconstruction Using Atom Optics
We present a novel technique in which the total internal quantum state of an
atom may be reconstructed via the measurement of the momentum transferred to an
atom following its interaction with a near resonant travelling wave laser beam.
We present the first such measurement and demonstrate the feasibility of the
technique.
