Quantum search on structured problems
This paper shows how a basic property of unitary transformations can be used
for meaningful computations. This approach immediately leads to search-type
applications, where it improves the number of steps by a square-root - a simple
minded search that takes N steps, can be improved to O(sqrt(N)) steps. The
quantum search algorithm is one of several immediate consequences of this
framework. Several novel search-related applications are presented.
