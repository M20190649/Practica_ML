Programmable quantum gate arrays
We show how to construct quantum gate arrays that can be programmed to
perform different unitary operations on a data register, depending on the input
to some program register. It is shown that a universal quantum gate array - a
gate array which can be programmed to perform any unitary operation - exists
only if one allows the gate array to operate in a probabilistic fashion. The
universal quantum gate array we construct requires an exponentially smaller
number of gates than a classical universal gate array.
