Optomechanical Cooling of a Macroscopic Oscillator by Homodyne Feedback
We propose a simple optomechanical model in which a mechanical oscillator
quadrature could be "cooled" well below its equilibrium temperature by applying
a suitable feedback to drive the orthogonal quadrature by means of the homodyne
current of the radiation field used to probe its position.
