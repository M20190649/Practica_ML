Quantum state diffusion, measurement and second quantization
Realistic dynamical theories of measurement based on the diffusion of quantum
states are nonunitary, whereas quantum field theory and its generalizations are
unitary. This problem in the quantum field theory of quantum state diffusion
(QSD) appears already in the Lagrangian formulation of QSD as a classical
equation of motion, where Liouville's theorem does not apply to the usual field
theory formulation. This problem is resolved here by doubling the number of
freedoms used to represent a quantum field. The space of quantum fields is then
a classical configuration space, for which volume need not be conserved,
instead of the usual phase space, to which Liouville's theorem applies. The
creation operator for the quantized field satisfies the QSD equations, but the
annihilation operator does not satisfy the conjugate eqation. It appears only
in a formal role.
