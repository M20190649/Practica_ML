Exponential Asymptotics in a Singular Limit for $n$-Level Scattering
  Systems
The singular limit $\eps\ra 0$ of the $S$-matrix associated with the equation
$i\eps d\psi(t)/dt=H(t)\psi(t)$ is considered, where the analytic generator
$H(t)\in M_n(\C)$ is such that its spectrum is real and non-degenerate for all
$t\in\R$. Sufficient conditions allowing to compute asymptotic formulas for the
exponentially small off-diagonal elements of the $S$-matrix as $\eps\ra 0$ are
explicited and a wide class of generators for which these conditions are
verified is defined. These generators are obtained by means of generators whose
spectrum exhibits eigenvalue crossings which are perturbed in such a way that
these crossings turn to avoided crossings. The exponentially small asymptotic
formulas which are derived are shown to be valid up to exponentially small
relative error, by means of a joint application of the complex WKB method
together with superasymptotic renormalization. The application of these results
to the study of quantum adiabatic transitions in the time dependent
Schr\"odinger equation and of the semiclassical scattering properties of the
multichannel stationary Schr\"odinger equation closes this paper. The results
presented here are a generalization to $n$-level systems, $n\geq 2$, of results
previously known for $2$-level systems only.
