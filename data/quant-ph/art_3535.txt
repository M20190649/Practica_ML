A Suggestion for a Teleological Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
We suggest solving the measurement problem by postulating the existence of a
special future final boundary condition for the universe. Although this is an
extension of the way boundary conditions are usually chosen (in terrestrial
laboratories), it is our only deviation from standard quantum mechanics. Using
two state vectors, or the "two-state", to describe completely the state of
systems of interest, we analyze ideal and "weak" measurements, and show the
consistency of our scheme. If the final state of a measuring device is assigned
to be one of the possible outcomes of the measurement, an effective reduction
is observed after an ideal measurement process. For final conditions chosen
with an appropriate distribution, the predictions of standard quantum mechanics
may be reconstructed, thus eliminating probability from the description of any
single measurement. The interpretation attained, the Teleological
Interpretation, is an ontological one; it is local and deterministic. Other
special assumptions in the choice of the final boundary condition may explain
certain unaccounted for phenomena, or even supply a mechanism for essential
free will. In this context we believe that a new conception of time should be
adopted.
