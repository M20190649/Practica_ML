Unitary relation between a harmonic oscillator of time-dependent
  frequency and a simple harmonic oscillator with and without an inverse-square
  potential
The unitary operator which transforms a harmonic oscillator system of
time-dependent frequency into that of a simple harmonic oscillator of different
time-scale is found, with and without an inverse-square potential. It is shown
that for both cases, this operator can be used in finding complete sets of wave
functions of a generalized harmonic oscillator system from the well-known sets
of the simple harmonic oscillator. Exact invariants of the time-dependent
systems can also be obtained from the constant Hamiltonians of unit mass and
frequency by making use of this unitary transformation. The geometric phases
for the wave functions of a generalized harmonic oscillator with an
inverse-square potential are given.
