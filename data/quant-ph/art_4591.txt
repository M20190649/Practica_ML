Coherent population trapping in two-electron three-level systems with
  aligned spins
The possibility of coherent population trapping in two electron states with
aligned spins (ortho-system) is evidenced. From the analysis of a three-level
atomic system containing two electrons, and driven by the two laser fields
needed for coherent population trapping, a conceptually new kind of
two-electron dark state appears. The properties of this trapping are studied
and are physically interpreted in terms of a dark hole, instead of a dark
two-electron state. This technique, among many other applications, offers the
possibility of measuring, with subnatural resolution, some superposition-state
matrix-elements of the electron-electron correlation that due to their time
dependent nature are inaccesible by standard measuring procedures.
