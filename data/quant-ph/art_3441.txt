Quantum algorithm for distributed clock synchronization
The clock synchronization problem is to determine the time difference
$\Delta$ between two spatially separated clocks. When message delivery times
between the two clocks are uncertain, $O(2^{2n})$ classical messages must be
exchanged between the clocks to determine $n$ digits of $\Delta$. On the other
hand, as we show, there exists a quantum algorithm to obtain $n$ digits of
$\Delta$ while communicating only O(n) quantum messages.
