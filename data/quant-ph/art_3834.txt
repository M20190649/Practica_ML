Bell's Theorem and Random Variables
Bell's theorem states that quantum correlation function of two spins can not
be represented as an expectation value of two classical random variables. Spin
is described in Bell's model by a single scalar random variable. We discuss
another classical model of spin in which spin is described by a triple of
classical random variables. It is shown that in this model the quantum
correlation function can be represented as the expectation value of classical
random variables. Implications of this result to the problem of local causality
of quantum mechanics and relations with problems of moments are briefly
mentioned.
