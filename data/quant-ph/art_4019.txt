Optimal quantum estimation of the coupling between two bosonic modes
We address the problem of the optimal quantum estimation of the coupling
parameter of a bilinear interaction, such as the transmittivity of a beam
splitter or the internal phase-shift of an interferometer. The optimal
measurement scheme exhibits Heisenberg scaling of the measurement precision
versus the total energy.
