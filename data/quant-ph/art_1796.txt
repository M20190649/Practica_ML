Quantum computation with ions in thermal motion
We propose an implementation of quantum logic gates via virtual vibrational
excitations in an ion trap quantum computer. Transition paths involving
unpopulated, vibrational states interfere destructively to eliminate the
dependence of rates and revolution frequencies on vibrational quantum numbers.
As a consequence quantum computation becomes feasible with ions whos vibrations
are strongly coupled to a thermal reservoir.
