A Linear Programming Approach to Attainable Cramer-Rao type Bounds and
  Randomness Condition
The author studies the Cramer-Rao type bound by a linear programming
approach. By this approach, he found a necessary and sufficient condition that
the Cramer-Rao type bound is attained by a random measurement. In a spin 1/2
system, this condition is satisfied.
