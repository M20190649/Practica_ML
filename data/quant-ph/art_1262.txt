Generalized Quantum Control-Not Gate in Two-Spin Ising System
The physical implementation of the quantum Control-Not gate for a two-spin
system is investigated numerically. The concept of a generalized quantum
Control-Not gate, with arbitrary phase shift, is introduced. It is shown that a
resonant $\pi$-pulse provides a simple example of a generalized quantum
Control-Not gate.
