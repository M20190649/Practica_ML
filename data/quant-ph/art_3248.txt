Quantum Fluctuations of a Single Trapped Atom: Transient Rabi
  Oscillations and Magnetic Bistability
Isolation of a single atomic particle and monitoring its resonance
fluorescence is a powerful tool for studies of quantum effects in
radiation-matter interaction. Here we present observations of quantum dynamics
of an isolated neutral atom stored in a magneto-optical trap. By means of
photon correlations in the atom's resonance fluorescence we demonstrate the
well-known phenomenon of photon antibunching which corresponds to transient
Rabi oscillations in the atom. Through polarization-sensitive photon
correlations we show a novel example of resolved quantum fluctuations:
spontaneous magnetic orientation of an atom. These effects can only be observed
with a single atom.
