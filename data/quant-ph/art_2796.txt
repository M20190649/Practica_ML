The Rate of Optimal Purification procedures
Purification is a process in which decoherence is partially reversed by using
several input systems which have been subject to the same noise. The purity of
the outputs generally increases with the number of input systems, and decreases
with the number of required output systems. We construct the optimal quantum
operations for this task, and discuss their asymptotic behaviour as the number
of inputs goes to infinity. The rate at which output systems may be generated
depends crucially on the type of purity requirement. If one tests the purity of
the outputs systems one at a time, the rate is infinite: this fidelity may be
made to approach 1, while at the same time the number of outputs goes to
infinity arbitrarily fast. On the other hand, if one also requires the
correlations between outputs to decrease, the rate is zero: if fidelity with
the pure product state is to go to 1, the number of outputs per input goes to
zero. However, if only a fidelity close to 1 is required, the optimal purifier
achieves a positive rate, which we compute.
