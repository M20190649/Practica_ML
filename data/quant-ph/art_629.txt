Optimizing entropy relative to a channel or a subalgebra
After recalling definition, monotonicity, concavity, and continuity of a
channel's entropy with respect to a state (finite dimensional cases only), I
introduce the roof property, a convex analytic tool, and show its use in
treating an example. Full proofs and more examples will appear elsewhere. The
relation (a la Benatti) to accessible information is mentioned.
