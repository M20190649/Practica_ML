Master Equation for Retrodiction of Quantum Communication Signals
We derive the master equation that governs the evolution of the measured
state backwards in time in an open system. This allows us to determine
probabilities for a given set of preparation events from the results of
subsequent measurements, which has particular relevance to quantum
communication.
