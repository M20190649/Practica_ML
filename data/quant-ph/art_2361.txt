On the Teleportation of Continuous Variable
The measurement procedures used in quantum teleportation are analyzed from
the viewpoint of the general theory of quantum-mechanical measurements. It is
shown that to find the teleported state one should only know the identity
resolution (positive operator-valued measure) generated by the corresponding
instrument (quantum operation describing the system state change caused by the
measurement) rather than the instrument itself. A quantum teleportation
protocol based on a measurement associated with a non-orthogonal identity
resolution is proposed for a system with non-degenerate continuous spectrum.
