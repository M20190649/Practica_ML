Selective continuous quantum measurements: Restricted path integrals and
  wave equations
We discuss both the restricted path integral (RPI) and the wave equation (WE)
techniques in the theory of continuous quantum measurements. We intend to make
Mensky's fresh review complete by transforming his "effective" WE with complex
Hamiltonian into Ito-differential equations.
