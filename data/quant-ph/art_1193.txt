Quantum-state synthesis of multi-mode bosonic fields: Preparation of
  arbitrary states of 2-D vibrational motion of trapped ions
We present a universal algorithm for an efficient deterministic preparation
of an arbitrary two--mode bosonic state. In particular, we discuss in detail
preparation of entangled states of a two-dimensional vibrational motion of a
trapped ion via a sequence of laser stimulated Raman transitions. Our formalism
can be generalized for multi-mode bosonic fields. We examine stability of our
algorithm with respect to a technical noise.
