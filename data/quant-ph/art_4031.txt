A quantum evaporation effect
A small momentum transfer to a particle interacting with a steep potential
barrier gives rise to a quantum evaporation effect which increases the
transmission appreciably. This effect results from the unexpectedly large
population of quantum states with energies above the height of the barrier. Its
characteristic properties are studied and an example of physical system in
which it may be observed is given.
