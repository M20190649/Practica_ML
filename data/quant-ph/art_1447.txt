Quantum mechanical 'Backward in Time'? Comments, Answers, and the Causal
  Indistinguishability Condition
We discuss a number of comments on quant-ph/9801061, and propose to introduce
the concept of 'Causal Indistinguishability'. The incompatibility between
Quantum Mechanics and Nonlocal Causality appears to be unavoidable: upholding
of Quantum Mechanics by experiment would mean to live with influences backward
in time, just as we are now living with such faster than light.
