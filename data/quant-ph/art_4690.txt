A General Phase Matching Condition for Quantum Searching Algorithm
A general consideration on the phase rotations in quantum searching algorithm
is taken in this work. As four phase rotations on the initial state, the marked
states, and the states orthogonal to them are taken account, we deduce a phase
matching condition for a successful search. The optimal options for these phase
are obtained consequently.
