Ground state laser cooling using electromagnetically induced
  transparency
A laser cooling method for trapped atoms is described which achieves ground
state cooling by exploiting quantum interference in a driven Lambda-shaped
arrangement of atomic levels. The scheme is technically simpler than existing
methods of sideband cooling, yet it can be significantly more efficient, in
particular when several motional modes are involved, and it does not impose
restrictions on the transition linewidth. We study the full quantum mechanical
model of the cooling process for one motional degree of freedom and show that a
rate equation provides a good approximation.
