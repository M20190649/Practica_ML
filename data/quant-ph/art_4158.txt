Continuous-variable and hybrid quantum gates
We provide several schemes to construct the continuous-variable SWAP gate and
present a Hermitian generalized many-body continuous controlled^n-NOT gate. We
introduce and study the hybrid controlled-NOT gate and controlled-SWAP gate,
and physical realizations of them are discussed in trapped-ion systems. These
continuous-variable and hybrid quantum gates may be used in the corresponding
continuous-variable and hybrid quantum computations.
