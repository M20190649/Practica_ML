Non-Resonant Effects in Implementation of Quantum Shor Algorithm
We simulate Shor's algorithm on an Ising spin quantum computer. The influence
of non-resonant effects is analyzed in detail. It is shown that our ``$2\pi
k$''-method successfully suppresses non-resonant effects even for relatively
large values of the Rabi frequency.
