Error-free optical quantum communication
An optical scheme for the reliable transfer of quantum information through a
noisy quantum channel is proposed. The scheme is inspired by quantum
error-correction protocols, but it avoids the currently infeasible requirement
for a controlled-NOT operation between single photons. The quantum
communication scheme presented here rejects single bit-flip errors instead of
correcting them and combines quantum-measurement properties of three-particle
entangled (GHZ) states with properties of quantum teleportation.
