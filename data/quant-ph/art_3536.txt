Separability of n-particle mixed states: necessary and sufficient
  conditions in terms of linear maps
We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of mixed
states of n-particle systems. The conditions are formulated in terms of maps
which are positive on product states of $n-1$ particles. The method of
providing of the maps on the basis of unextendable product bases is provided.
The three qubit state problem is reformulated in the form suggesting
possibility of explicite characterisation of all maps needed for separability
condition.
