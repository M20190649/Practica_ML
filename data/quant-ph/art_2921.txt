Bell Theorem for Nonclassical Part of Quantum Teleportation Process
The quantum teleportation process is composed of a joint measurement
performed upon two subsystems A and B (uncorrelated), followed by a unitary
transformation (parameters of which depend on the outcome of the measurement)
performed upon a third subsystem C (EPR correlated with system B). The
information about the outcome of the measurement is transferred by classical
means. The measurement performed upon the systems A and B collapses their joint
wavefunction into one of the four {\it entangled} Bell states. It is shown here
that this measurement process plus a possible measurement on the third
subsystem (with classical channel switched off - no additional unitary
transformation performed) cannot be described by a local realistic theory.
