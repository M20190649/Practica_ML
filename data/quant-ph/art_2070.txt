Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion: Perturbation approach
We present a perturbation theory for non-Markovian quantum state diffusion
(QSD), the theory of diffusive quantum trajectories for open systems in a
bosonic environment [Physical Review {\bf A 58}, 1699, (1998)]. We establish a
systematic expansion in the ratio between the environmental correlation time
and the typical system time scale. The leading order recovers the Markov
theory, so here we concentrate on the next-order correction corresponding to
first-order non-Markovian master equations. These perturbative equations
greatly simplify the general non-Markovian QSD approach, and allow for
efficient numerical simulations beyond the Markov approximation. Furthermore,
we show that each perturbative scheme for QSD naturally gives rise to a
perturbative scheme for the master equation which we study in some detail.
Analytical and numerical examples are presented, including the quantum Brownian
motion model.
