Measurement in Quantum Mechanics: From Probabilities to Objective Events
The problem of measurement in quantum mechanics is reanalyzed within a
general, strictly probabilistic framework (without reduction postulate). Based
on a novel comprehensive definition of measurement the natural emergence of
objective events is demonstrated and their formal representation within quantum
mechanics is obtained. In order to be objective an event is required to be
observable or readable in at least two independent, mutually non-interfering
ways with necessarily agreeing results. Consistency in spite of unrestricted
validity of reversibility of the evolution or the superposition principle is
demonstrated and the role played by state reduction, in a properly defined
restricted sense, is discussed. Some general consequences are pointed out.
