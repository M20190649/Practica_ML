Is "entanglement" always entangled?
Entanglement, including ``quantum entanglement,'' is a consequence of
correlation between objects. When the objects are subunits of pairs which in
turn are members of an ensemble described by a wave function, a correlation
among the subunits induces the mysterious properties of ``cat-states.''
However, correlation between subsystems can be present from purely non-quantum
sources, thereby entailing no unfathomable behavior. Such entanglement arises
whenever the so-called ``qubit space'' is not afflicted with Heisenberg
Uncertainty. It turns out that all optical experimental realizations of EPR's
\emph{Gedanken} experiment in fact do not suffer Heisenberg Uncertainty.
Examples will be analyzed and non-quantum models for some of these described.
The consequences for experiments that were to test EPR's contention in the form
of Bell's Theorem are drawn: \emph{valid tests of EPR's hypothesis have yet to
be done.}
