Cold Atoms For Testing Quantum Mechanics and Parity Violation In
  Gravitation
Techniques of Atom trapping and laser cooling have proved to be very
important tools in probing many aspects of fundamental physics. In this talk I
wish to present ideas on how they may used to settle certain issues in the
foundational aspects of quantum mechanics on the one hand and about some
quantum gravitational interactions of matter that violate parity and
time-reversal, on the other hand.
