Ensemble versus individual system in quantum optics
Modern techniques allow experiments on a single atom or system, with new
phenomena and new challenges for the theoretician. We discuss what quantum
mechanics has to say about a single system. The quantum jump approach as well
as the role of quantum trajectories are outlined and a rather sophisticated
example is given.
