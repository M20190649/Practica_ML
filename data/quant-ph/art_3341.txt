Defect Mass in Gravitational Field and Red Shift of Atomic and Nuclear
  Radiation Spectra
It is shown, that radiation spectrum of atoms (or nuclei) in the
gravitational field has a red shift since the effective mass of radiating
electrons (or nucleons) changes in this field. This red shift is equal to the
red shift of radiation spectrum in the gravitational field measured in
existence experiments. The same shift must arise when the photon (or $ \gamma $
quantum) is passing through the gravitational field if it participates in
gravitational interactions (photon has no rest mass). The absence of the double
effect in the experiments, probably, means that photons (or $ \gamma $ quanta)
are passing through the gravitational field without interactions.
