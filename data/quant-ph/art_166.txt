Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory VII: The Classical Spin
  Eigenfunctions
In this continuation paper the Schr\"odinger equation for the half-integral
spin eigenfunctions is obtained and solved. We show that all the properties
already derived using the Heisemberg matrix calculation and Pauli's matrices
are also obtained in the realm of these analytical functions. We also show that
Einstein-Bose condensation for fermions is expected. We then conclude this
series of two papers on the concept of classical spin.
