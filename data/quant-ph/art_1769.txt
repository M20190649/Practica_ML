A posteriori teleportation
The article by Bouwmeester et al. on experimental quantum teleportation
constitutes an important advance in the burgeoning field of quantum
information. The experiment was motivated by the proposal of Bennett et al. in
which an unknown quantum state is `teleported' by Alice to Bob. As illustrated
in Fig. 1, in the implementation of this procedure, by Bouwmeester et al., an
input quantum state is `disembodied' into quantum and classical components, as
in the original protocol. However, in contrast to the original scheme,
Bouwmeester et al.'s procedure necessarily destroys the state at Bob's
receiving terminal, so a `teleported' state can never emerge as a freely
propagating state for subsequent examination or exploitation. In fact,
teleportation is achieved only as a postdiction.
