Single Molecule Magnetic Resonance and Quantum Computation
It is proposed that nuclear (or electron) spins in a trapped molecule would
be well isolated from the environment and the state of each spin can be
measured by means of mechanical detection of magnetic resonance. Therefore
molecular traps make an entirely new approach possible for spin-resonance
quantum computation which can be conveniently scaled up. In the context of
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a molecular trap promises the ultimate
sensitivity for single spin detection and an unprecedented spectral resolution
as well.
