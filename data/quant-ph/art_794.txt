Quantum Gates and Circuits
A historical review is given of the emergence of the idea of the quantum
logic gate from the theory of reversible Boolean gates. I highlight the quantum
XOR or controlled NOT as the fundamental two-bit gate for quantum computation.
This gate plays a central role in networks for quantum error correction.
