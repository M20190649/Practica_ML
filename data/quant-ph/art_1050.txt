Laser cooling of single trapped atoms to the ground state: a dark state
  in position space
We propose a scheme that allows to laser cool trapped atoms to the ground
state of a one-dimensional confining potential. The scheme is based on the
creation of a dark state by designing the laser profile, so that the hottest
atoms are coherently pumped to another internal level, and then repumped back.
The scheme works beyond the Lamb-Dicke limit. We present results of a full
quantum treatment for a one-dimensional model.
