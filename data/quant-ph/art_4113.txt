The dissipative dynamics of the field of two-photon Jaynes-Cummings
  model with Stark shift in dispersive approximation
We present the dissipative dynamics of the field of two-photon
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) with Stark shift in dispersive approximation and
investigate the influence of dissipation on entanglement. We show the coherence
properties of the field can be affected by the dissipative cavity when
nonlinear two-photon process is involved.
