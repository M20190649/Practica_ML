Coherent transport of matter waves
A transport theory for atomic matter waves in low-dimensional waveguides is
outlined. The thermal fluctuation spectrum of magnetic near fields leaking out
of metallic microstructures is estimated. The corresponding scattering rate for
paramagnetic atoms turns out to be quite large in micrometer-sized waveguides
(approx. 100/s). Analytical estimates for the heating and decoherence of a cold
atom cloud are given. We finally discuss numerical and analytical results for
the scattering from static potential imperfections and the ensuing spatial
diffusion process.
