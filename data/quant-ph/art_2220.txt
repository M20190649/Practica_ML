Testing of quantum phase in matter wave optics
Various phase concepts may be treated as special cases of the maximum
likelihood estimation. For example the discrete Fourier estimation that
actually coincides with the operational phase of Noh, Fouge`res and Mandel is
obtained for continuous Gaussian signals with phase modulated mean.Since
signals in quantum theory are discrete, a prediction different from that given
by the Gaussian hypothesis should be obtained as the best fit assuming a
discrete Poissonian statistics of the signal. Although the Gaussian estimation
gives a satisfactory approximation for fitting the phase distribution of almost
any state the optimal phase estimation offers in certain cases a measurable
better performance. This has been demonstrated in neutron--optical experiment.
