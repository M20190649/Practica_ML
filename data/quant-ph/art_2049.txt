Pattern formation in quantum Turing machines
We investigate the iteration of a sequence of local and pair unitary
transformations, which can be interpreted to result from a Turing-head
(pseudo-spin $S$) rotating along a closed Turing-tape ($M$ additional
pseudo-spins). The dynamical evolution of the Bloch-vector of $S$, which can be
decomposed into $2^{M}$ primitive pure state Turing-head trajectories, gives
rise to fascinating geometrical patterns reflecting the entanglement between
head and tape. These machines thus provide intuitive examples for quantum
parallelism and, at the same time, means for local testing of quantum network
dynamics.
