Remote State Preparation
Quantum teleportation uses prior entanglement and forward classical
communication to transmit one instance of an unknown quantum state. Remote
state preparation (RSP) has the same goal, but the sender knows classically
what state is to be transmitted. We show that the asymptotic classical
communication cost of RSP is one bit per qubit - half that of teleportation -
and becomes even less when transmitting part of a known entangled state. We
explore the tradeoff between entanglement and classical communication required
for RSP, and discuss RSP capacities of general quantum channels.
