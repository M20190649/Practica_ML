Squeezed angular momentum coherent states: construction and time
  evolution
A family of angular momentum coherent states on the sphere is constructed
using previous work by Aragone et al [1]. These states depend on a complex
parameter which allows an arbitrary squeezing of the angular momentum
uncertainties. The time evolution of these states is analyzed assuming a rigid
body hamiltonian. The rich scenario of fractional revivals is exhibited with
cloning and many interference effects.
