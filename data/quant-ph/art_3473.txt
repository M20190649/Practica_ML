Cooling of a single atom in an optical trap inside a resonator
We present detailed discussions of cooling and trapping mechanisms for an
atom in an optical trap inside an optical cavity, as relevant to recent
experiments. The interference pattern of cavity QED and trapping fields in
space makes the trapping wells distinguishable from one another. This adds
considerable flexibility to creating effective trapping and cooling conditions
and to detection possibilities. Friction and diffusion coefficients are
calculated in and beyond the low excitation limit and full 3-D simulations of
the quasiclassical motion of a Cs atom are performed.
