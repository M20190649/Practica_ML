Quantum computation in a one-dimensional crystal lattice with NMR force
  microscopy
A proposal for a scalable, solid-state implementation of a quantum computer
is presented. Qubits are fluorine nuclear spins in a solid crystal of
fluorapatite [Ca_5 F(PO_4)_3] with resonant frequencies separated by a large
field gradient. Quantum logic is accomplished using nuclear-nuclear dipolar
couplings with decoupling and selective recoupling RF pulse sequences. Magnetic
resonance force microscopy is used for readout. As many as 300 qubits can be
implemented in the laboratory extremes of T=10 mK and B_0=20 T with the
existing sensitivity of force microscopy.
