Testing Bell's inequality with two-level atoms via population
  spectroscopy
We propose a feasible experimental scheme, employing methods of population
spectroscopy with two-level atoms, for a test of Bell's inequality for massive
particles. The correlation function measured in this scheme is the joint atomic
$Q$ function. An inequality imposed by local realism is violated by any
entangled state of a pair of atoms.
