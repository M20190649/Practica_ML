Supersymmetry and Supercoherent States of a Nonrelativistic Free
  Particle
Coordinate atypical representation of the orthosymplectic superalgebra
osp(2/2) in a Hilbert superspace of square integrable functions constructed in
a special way is given. The quantum nonrelativistic free particle Hamiltonian
is an element of this superalgebra which turns out to be a dynamical
superalgebra for this system. The supercoherent states, defined by means of a
supergroup displacement operator, are explicitly constructed. These are the
coordinate representation of the known atypical abstract super group $OSp(2/2)$
coherent states. We interpret obtained results from the classical mechanics
viewpoint as a model of classical particle which is immovable in the even
sector of the phase superspace and is in rectilinear movement (in the
appropriate coordinate system) in its odd sector.
