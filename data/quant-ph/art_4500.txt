Correlations in quantum systems and branch points in the complex plane
Branch points in the complex plane are responsible for avoided level
crossings in closed and open quantum systems. They create not only an exchange
of the wave functions but also a mixing of the states of a quantum system at
high level density. The influence of branch points in the complex plane on the
low-lying states of the system is small.
