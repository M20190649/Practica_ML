Macroscopically distinct quantum superposition states as a bosonic code
  for amplitude damping
We show how macroscopically distinct quantum superposition states
(Schroedinger cat states) may be used as logical qubit encodings for the
correction of spontaneous emission errors. Spontaneous emission causes a bit
flip error which is easily corrected by a standard error correction circuit.
The method works arbitrarily well as the distance between the amplitudes of the
superposed coherent states increases.
