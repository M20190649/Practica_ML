Classical and Quantum Perturbation Theory for two Non--Resonant
  Oscillators with Quartic Interaction
We study the classical and quantum perturbation theory for two non--resonant
oscillators coupled by a nonlinear quartic interaction. In particular we
analyze the question of quantum corrections to the torus quantization of the
classical perturbation theory (semiclassical mechanics). We obtain up to the
second order of perturbation theory an explicit analytical formula for the
quantum energy levels, which is the semiclassical one plus quantum corrections.
We compare the "exact" quantum levels obtained numerically to the semiclassical
levels studying also the effects of quantum corrections.
