Quantum Tunneling in the Wigner Representation
Time dependence for barrier penetration is considered in the phase space. An
asymptotic phase-space propagator for nonrelativistic scattering on a one -
dimensional barrier is constructed. The propagator has a form universal for
various initial state preparations and local potential barriers. It is
manifestly causal and includes time-lag effects and quantum spreading. Specific
features of quantum dynamics which disappear in the standard semi-classical
approximation are revealed. The propagator may be applied to calculation of the
final momentum and coordinate distributions, for particles transmitted through
or reflected from the potential barrier, as well as for elucidating the
tunneling time problem.
