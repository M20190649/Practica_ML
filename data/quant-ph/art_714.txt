Weisskopf-Wigner model for wave packet excitation
We consider a laser induced molecular excitation process as a decay of a
single energy state into a continuum. The analytic results based on
Weisskopf-Wigner approach and perturbation calculations are compared with
numerical wave packet results. We find that the decay model describes the
excitation process well within the expected parameter region.
