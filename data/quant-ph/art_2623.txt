Exact solution for Morse oscillator in PT-symmetric quantum mechanics
The recently proposed PT-symmetric quantum mechanics works with complex
potentials which possess, roughly speaking, a symmetric real part and an
anti-symmetric imaginary part. We propose and describe a new exactly solvable
model of this type. It is defined as a specific analytic continuation of the
shape-invariant potential of Morse. In contrast to the latter well-known
example, all the new spectrum proves real, discrete and bounded below. All its
three separate subsequences are quadratic in n.
