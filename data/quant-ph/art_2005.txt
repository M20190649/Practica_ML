Broadband detection of squeezed vacuum: A spectrum of quantum states
We demonstrate the simultaneous quantum state reconstruction of the spectral
modes of the light field emitted by a continuous wave degenerate optical
parametric amplifier. The scheme is based on broadband measurement of the
quantum fluctuations of the electric field quadratures and subsequent Fourier
decomposition into spectral intervals. Applying the standard reconstruction
algorithms to each bandwidth-limited quantum trajectory, a "spectrum" of
density matrices and Wigner functions is obtained. The recorded states show a
smooth transition from the squeezed vacuum to a vacuum state. In the time
domain we evaluated the first order correlation function of the squeezed output
field, showing good agreement with the theory.
