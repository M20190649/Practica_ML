The derivation of Bell inequalities for beables
The derivation of Bell inequalities for beables is well-known to require a
"no-conspiracy" assumption. This assumption is widely accepted, the alternative
being correlations between instrument settings and hidden beables. Two further
assumptions are identified here: (1) a "no-contextuality" assumption, similar
to the prohibition of contextuality that is required to derive the
Kochen-Specker theorem, which is closely related to the "no-conspiracy"
assumption; (2) a "no-correlation" assumption, which prohibits correlations
between hidden beables. The three assumptions together are less acceptable than
the "no-conspiracy" assumption alone.
