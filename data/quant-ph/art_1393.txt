Recoil and momentum diffusion of an atom close to a vacuum-dielectric
  interface
We derive the quantum-mechanical master equation (generalized optical Bloch
equation) for an atom in the vicinity of a flat dielectric surface. This
equation gives access to the semiclassical radiation pressure force and the
atomic momentum diffusion tensor, that are expressed in terms of the vacuum
field correlation function (electromagnetic field susceptibility). It is
demonstrated that the atomic center-of-mass motion provides a nonlocal probe of
the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. We show in particular that in a
circularly polarized evanescent wave, the radiation pressure force experienced
by the atoms is not colinear with the evanescent wave's propagation vector. In
a linearly polarized evanescent wave, the recoil per fluorescence cycle leads
to a net magnetization for a Jg = 1/2 ground state atom.
