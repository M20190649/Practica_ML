Higher order conductivity corrections to the Casimir force
The finite conductivity corrections to the Casimir force in two
configurations are calculated in the third and fourth orders in relative
penetration depth of electromagnetic zero oscillations into the metal. The
obtained analytical perturbation results are compared with recent computations.
Applications to the modern experiments are discussed.
