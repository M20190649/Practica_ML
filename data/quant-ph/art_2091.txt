Broadcasting of entanglement and universal quantum cloners
We study broadcasting of entanglement where we use universal quantum cloners
(in general less optimal) to perform local cloning operations. We show that
there is a lower bound on the fidelity of the universal quantum cloners that
can be used for broadcasting. We prove that an entanglement is optimally
broadcast only when optimal quantum cloners are used for local copying. We also
show that broadcasting of entanglement into more than two entangled pairs is
forbidden using only local operations.
