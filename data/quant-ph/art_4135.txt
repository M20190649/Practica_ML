Magnetic Dipoles and Quantum Coherence in Muscle Contraction
An actin filament contacting myosin molecules as a functional unit of muscle
contraction induces magnetic dipoles along the filament when ATP molecules to
be hydrolyzed are available there. The induced magnetic dipoles are coherent
over the entire filament, though they are fluctuating altogether as constantly
being subject to the ambient thermal agitations.
