Emergence of Weak Values
Various quantum measurement procedures are analyzed and it is shown that
under certain conditions they yield consistently {\em weak values} which might
be very different from the eigenvalues, the allowed outcomes according to the
standard quantum formalism. The weak value outcomes result from peculiar
quantum interference of the pointer variable of the measuring device.
