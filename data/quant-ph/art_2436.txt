How to realize quantum superluminal communication?
We deeply analyze the possibility to achieve quantum superluminal
communication beyond the domain of special relativity and present quantum
theory, and show that when using the conscious object as one part of the
measuring device, quantum superluminal communication may be a natural thing.
