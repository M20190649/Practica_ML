Fundamentals of quantum mutual entropy and capacity
The study of mutual entropy (information) and capacity in classica l system
was extensively done after Shannon by several authors like Kolmogor ov and
Gelfand. In quantum systems, there have been several definitions of t he mutual
entropy for classical input and quantum output. In 1983, the autho r defined
the fully quantum mechanical mutual entropy by means of the relati ve entropy
of Umegaki, and he extended it to general quantum systems by the relative
entropy of Araki and Uhlmann. When the author introduced the quantu m mutual
entropy, he did not indicate that it contains other definitions of the mutual
entropy including classical one, so that there exist several misu nderstandings
for the use of the mutual entropy (information) to compute the capacity of
quantum channels. Therefore in this note we point out that our quantum mutual
entropy generalizes others and where the m isuse occurs.
