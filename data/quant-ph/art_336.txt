Coherent States for Kronecker Products of Non-Compact Groups:
  Formulation and Applications
We introduce and study the properties of a class of coherent states for the
group SU(1,1) X SU(1,1) and derive explicit expressions for these using the
Clebsch-Gordan algebra for the SU(1,1) group. We restrict ourselves to the
discrete series representations of SU(1,1). These are the generalization of the
`Barut Girardello' coherent states to the Kronecker Product of two non-compact
groups.The resolution of the identity and the analytic phase space
representation of these states is presented. This phase space representation is
based on the basis of products of `pair coherent states' rather than the
standard number state canonical basis. We discuss the utility of the resulting
`bi-pair coherent states' in the context of four-mode interactions in quantum
optics.
