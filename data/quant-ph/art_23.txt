What happens to spin during the SO(3)->SE(2) contraction? (On spin and
  extended structures in quantum mechanics)
It is shown that the spin operator can be described by an algebra which is in
between so(3) and e(2). Relativistic version of the singlet state for two Dirac
electrons is discussed. It is shown that a measure of massless particle's
extension can be naturally constructed and that this measure corresponds at the
classical level to the radius of the Robinson congruence.
