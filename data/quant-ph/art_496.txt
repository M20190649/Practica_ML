Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment with relativistic massive
  particles
The EPRB experiment with massive partcles can be formulated if one defines
spin in a relativistic way. Two versions are discussed: The one using the spin
operator defined via the relativistic center-of-mass operator, and the one
using the Pauli-Lubanski vector. Both are shown to lead to the SAME prediction
for the EPRB experiment: The degree of violation of the Bell inequality
DECREASES with growing velocity of the EPR pair of spin-1/2 particles. The
phenomenon can be physically understood as a combined effect of the Lorentz
contraction and the Moller shift of the relativistic center of mass. The effect
is therefore stronger than standard relativistic phenomena such as the Lorentz
contraction or time dilatation. The fact that the Bell inequality is in general
less violated than in the nonrelativistic case will have to be taken into
account in tests for eavesdropping if massive particles will be used for a key
transfer.
