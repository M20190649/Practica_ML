Comments on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation
A proof is given that if the nonlinear Schrodinger wave function is
constrained to have support over only a finite volume in configuration space,
then the total energy is bounded from below for either sign of the logarithmic
term in the Hamiltonian. It is concluded that the usual assumption about the
sign of the logarithmic term made by Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski is not the
only possibility, and that a sensible theory can be made with the opposite sign
as well.
