Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory V: The Quantum Schwartzchild
  Problem
In this continuation paper, we apply the general relativistic quantum theory
for one particle systems, derived in paper II of this series, to a simple
problem: the quantum Schwartzchild problem, where one particle of mass {\it m%
} gravitates around a massive body. The results thus obtained reveal that, in
the realm of such a theory, the negative mass conjecture we made in paper IV of
this series is, indeed, adequate. It is shown that gravitation is responsible
for the loss of energy quantization. We relate this property with the ideas of
irreversibility and time arrow.
