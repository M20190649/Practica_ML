About Position Measurements Which Do Not Show the Bohmian Particle
  Position
``Weak'', ``protective'', and ``delayed observation'' measurements are
analyzed in the framework of the Bohm interpretation of quantum theory. It is
argued that the above varieties of measurements manifest some difficulties of
the Bohm interpretation since they show that Bohmian trajectories behave not as
we would expect from a classical type model.
