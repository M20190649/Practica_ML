Non-local two-photon correlations using interferometers physically
  separated by 35 meters
An experimental demonstration of quantum correlations is presented. Energy
and time entangled photons at wavelengths of 704 and 1310 nm are produced by
parametric downconversion in KNbO3 and are sent through optical fibers into a
bulk-optical (704 nm) and an all-fiber Michelson-interferometer (1310 nm),
respectively. The two interferometers are located 35 meters aside from one
another. Using Faraday-mirrors in the fiber-interferometer, all birefringence
effects in the fibers are automatically compensated. We obtained two-photon
fringe visibilities of up to 95 % from which one can project a violation of
Bell's inequality by 8 standard deviations. The good performance and the
auto-aligning feature of Faraday-mirror interferometers show their potential
for a future test of Bell's inequalities in order to examine
quantum-correlations over long distances.
