Spontaneous emission of non-dispersive Rydberg wave packets
Non dispersive electronic Rydberg wave packets may be created in atoms
illuminated by a microwave field of circular polarization. We discuss the
spontaneous emission from such states and show that the elastic incoherent
component (occuring at the frequency of the driving field) dominates the
spectrum in the semiclassical limit, contrary to earlier predictions. We
calculate the frequencies of single photon emissions and the associated rates
in the "harmonic approximation", i.e. when the wave packet has approximately a
Gaussian shape. The results agree well with exact quantum mechanical
calculations, which validates the analytical approach.
