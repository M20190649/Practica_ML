Total Teleportation of an Entangled State
We present a setup for a direct, total teleportation of a single-particle
entangled state. Our scheme consists of a parametric down-conversion source,
which emits a pair of entangled photons, and a dual Bell measurement system
with two beam splitters and two pairs of detectors. An entangled state shared
by a pair of beams can be directly transferred to another pair of beams with a
50% probability of success. By a straightforward generalization of the scheme,
total teleportation of a multi-particle entangled state can also be performed.
