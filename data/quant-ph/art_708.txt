Separability criterion and inseparable mixed states with positive
  partial transposition
It is shown that any separable state on Hilbert space ${\cal H}={\cal
H}_1\otimes{\cal H}_2$, can be written as a convex combination of N pure
product states with $N\leq (dim{\cal H})^2$. Then a new separability criterion
for mixed states in terms of range of density matrix is obtained. It is used in
construction of inseparable mixed states with positive partial transposition in
the case of $3\times 3$ and $2\times 4$ systems. The states represent an
entanglement which is hidden in a more subtle way than it has been known so
far.
