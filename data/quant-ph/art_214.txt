Purification of Noisy Entanglement and Faithful Teleportation via Noisy
  Channels
Two separated observers, by applying local operations to a supply of
not-too-impure entangled states ({\em e.g.} singlets shared through a noisy
channel), can prepare a smaller number of entangled pairs of arbitrarily high
purity ({\em e.g.} near-perfect singlets). These can then be used to faithfully
teleport unknown quantum states from one observer to the other, thereby
achieving faithful transfrom one observer to the other, thereby achieving
faithful transmission of quantum information through a noisy channel. We give
upper and lower bounds on the yield $D(M)$ of pure singlets ($\ket{\Psi^-}$)
distillable from mixed states $M$, showing $D(M)>0$ if
$\bra{\Psi^-}M\ket{\Psi^-}>\half$.
