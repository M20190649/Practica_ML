Quantum computers can search rapidly by using almost any transformation
A quantum computer has a clear advantage over a classical computer for
exhaustive search. The quantum mechanical algorithm for exhaustive search was
originally derived by using subtle properties of a particular quantum
mechanical operation called the Walsh-Hadamard (W-H) transform. This paper
shows that this algorithm can be implemented by replacing the W-H transform by
almost any quantum mechanical operation. This leads to several new applications
where it improves the number of steps by a square-root. It also broadens the
scope for implementation since it demonstrates quantum mechanical algorithms
that can readily adapt to available technology.
