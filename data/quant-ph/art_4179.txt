Distillability via protocols respecting the positivity of partial
  transpose
We show that all quantum states that do not have a positive partial transpose
are distillable via channels, which preserve the positivity of the partial
transpose. The question whether NPT bound entanglement exist is therefore
closely related to the connection between the set of separable superoperators
and PPT-preserving maps.
