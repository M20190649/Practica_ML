Classical and Quantum Propagation of Chaos
This article examines the relationship between classical and quantum
propagation of chaos. (In this context, "chaos" refers to the Boltzmann's
Ansatz of molecular disorder, not to chaotic dynamics.) Classical propagation
of chaos is shown to occur when quantum systems that propagate quantum
molecular chaos are suitably prepared, allowed to evolve without interference,
and then observed.
