Multiphoton Coincidence Spectroscopy
We extend the analysis of photon coincidence spectroscopy beyond bichromatic
excitation and two-photon coincidence detection to include multichromatic
excitation and multiphoton coincidence detection. Trichromatic excitation and
three-photon coincidence spectroscopy are studied in detail, and we identify an
observable signature of a triple resonance in an atom-cavity system.
