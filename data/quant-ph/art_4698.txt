A quantum Goldreich-Levin theorem with cryptographic applications
We investigate the Goldreich-Levin Theorem in the context of quantum
information. This result is a reduction from the computational problem of
inverting a one-way function to the problem of predicting a particular bit
associated with that function. We show that the quantum version of the
reduction -- between quantum one-way functions and quantum hard-predicates --
is quantitatively more efficient than the known classical version. Roughly
speaking, if the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in
the reduction is by a factor of O(n/epsilon^2) in the classical case but only
by a factor of O(1/epsilon) in the quantum case, where 1/2 + epsilon is the
probability of predicting the hard-predicate. Moreover, we prove via a lower
bound that, in a black-box framework, the classical version of the reduction
cannot have overhead less than order n/epsilon^2.
  We also show that, using this reduction, a quantum bit commitment scheme that
is perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any
quantum one-way permutation. This complements a recent result by Dumais, Mayers
and Salvail, where the bit commitment scheme is perfectly concealing and
computationally binding. We also show how to perform qubit commitment by a
similar approach.
