Laser Cooling of Trapped Fermi Gases deeply below the Fermi Temperature
We study the collective Raman cooling of a polarized trapped Fermi gas in the
Festina Lente regime, when the heating effects associated with photon
reabsorptions are suppressed. We predict that by adjusting the spontaneous
Raman emission rates and using appropriately designed anharmonic traps,
temperatures of the order of 2.7% of the Fermi temperature can be achieved in
3D.
