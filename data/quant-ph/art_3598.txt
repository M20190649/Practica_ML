Locality and Bell's inequality
We prove that the locality condition is irrelevant to Bell in equality. We
check that the real origin of the Bell's inequality is the assumption of
applicability of classical (Kolmogorovian) probability theory to quantum
mechanics. We describe the chameleon effect which allows to construct an
experiment realizing a local, realistic, classical, deterministic and
macroscopic violation of the Bell inequalities.
