Quantum secure identification using entanglement and catalysis
I consider the use of entanglement between two parties to enable one to
authenticate her identity to another over a quantum communication channel.
Exploiting the phenomenon of entanglement-catalyzed transformations between
pure states gives a potentially reusable entangled identification token. In
analyzing this, I consider the independently interesting problem of the best
possible approximation to a given pure entangled state realizable using local
actions and classical communication by parties sharing a different entangled
state.
