A Critique on `Quantum No-Deleting Principle'
The argument used, in a recent letter to Nature (Nature 130 vol 404, 2000) to
arrive at the `quantum-no-deleting principle' is erroneous. It is pointed out
here that there may not be anything like such a principle. In any case, the
claims made in the letter are beyond its working premise.
