Unconditional teleportation of continuous-variable entanglement
We give a protocol and criteria for demonstrating unconditional teleportation
of continuous-variable entanglement (i.e., entanglement swapping). The initial
entangled states are produced with squeezed light and linear optics. We show
that any nonzero entanglement (any nonzero squeezing) in both of two
entanglement sources is sufficient for entanglement swapping to occur. In fact,
realization of continuous-variable entanglement swapping is possible using only
{\it two} single-mode squeezed states.
