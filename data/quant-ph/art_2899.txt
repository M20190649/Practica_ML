Driving Atoms Into Decoherence-Free States
We describe the decoherence-free subspace of N atoms in a cavity, in which
decoherence due to the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors is
suppressed. We show how the states of the subspace can be entangled with the
help of weak laser pulses, using the high decay rate of the cavity field and
strong coupling between the atoms and the resonator mode. The atoms remain
decoherence-free with a probability which can, in principle, be arbitrarily
close to unity.
