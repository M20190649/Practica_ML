Matter-wave entanglement and teleportation by molecular dissociation and
  collisions
We propose dissociation of cold diatomic molecules as a source of atom pairs
with highly correlated (entangled) positions and momenta, approximating the
original quantum state introduced by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) [Phys.
Rev. 47, 777 (1935)]. Wavepacket teleportation is shown to be achievable by its
collision with one of the EPR correlated atoms and manipulation of the other
atom in the pair.
