Local symmetry properties of pure 3-qubit states
Entanglement types of pure states of 3 qubits are classified by means of
their stabilisers in the group of local unitary operations. It is shown that
the stabiliser is generically discrete, and that a larger stabiliser indicates
a stationary value for some local invariant. We describe all the exceptional
states with enlarged stabilisers.
