Impossibility of deleting an unknown quantum state
A photon in an arbitrary polarization state cannot be cloned perfectly. But
suppose that at our disposal we have several copies of an unknown photon. Is it
possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a
physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial
polarization state is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same
initial state and the other in some standard polarization state. If this can be
done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an
unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by
probabilistic cloning. This might be useful in quantum computation, where one
could store some new information in an already computed state by deleting the
old information. Here we show that the linearity of quantum theory does not
allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a
classical computer information can be deleted against a copy, the same task
cannot be accomplished with quantum information.
