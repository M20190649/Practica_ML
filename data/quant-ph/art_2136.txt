Quantum superposition of multiple clones and the novel cloning machine
we envisage a novel quantum cloning machine, which takes an input state and
produces an output state whose success branch can exist in a linear
superposition of multiple copies of the input state and the failure branch
exist in a superposition of composite state independent of the input state. We
prove that unknown non-orthogonal states chosen from a set $\cal S$ can evolve
into a linear superposition of multiple clones by a unitary process if and only
if the states are linearly independent. We derive a bound on the success
probability of the novel cloning machine. We argue that the deterministic and
probabilistic clonings are special cases of our novel cloning machine.
