Heterodyne and adaptive phase measurements on states of fixed mean
  photon number
The standard technique for measuring the phase of a single mode field is
heterodyne detection. Such a measurement may have an uncertainty far above the
intrinsic quantum phase uncertainty of the state. Recently it has been shown
[H. M. Wiseman and R. B. Killip, Phys. Rev. A 57, 2169 (1998)] that an adaptive
technique introduces far less excess noise. Here we quantify this difference by
an exact numerical calculation of the minimum measured phase variance for the
various schemes, optimized over states with a fixed mean photon number. We also
analytically derive the asymptotics for these variances. For the case of
heterodyne detection our results disagree with the power law claimed by
D'Ariano and Paris [Phys. Rev. A 49, 3022 (1994)].
