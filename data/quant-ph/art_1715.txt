Comment on "Consistency, amplitudes, and probabilities in quantum
  theory"
In a recent article [Phys. Rev. A 57, 1572 (1998)] Caticha has concluded that
``nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics are inconsistent.'' In this note we
identify what it is that nonlinear quantum theories have been shown to be
inconsistent with.
