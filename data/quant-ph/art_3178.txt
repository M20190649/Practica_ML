Factoring the unitary evolution operator and quantifying entanglement
The unitary evolution can be represented by a finite product of exponential
operators. It leads to a perturbative expression of the density operator of a
close system. Based on the perturbative expression scheme, we present a
entanglement measure, this measure has the advantage that it is easy to compute
for a general dynamical process.
