Quantum copying: Fundamental inequalities
How well one can copy an arbitrary qubit? To answer this question we consider
two arbitrary vectors in a two-dimensional state space and an abstract copying
transformation which will copy these two vectors. If the vectors are
orthogonal, then perfect copies can be made. If they are not, then errors will
be introduced. The size of the error depends on the inner product of the two
original vectors. We derive a lower bound for the amount of noise induced by
quantum copying. We examine both copying transformations which produce one copy
and transformations which produce many, and show that the quality of each copy
decreases as the number of copies increases.
