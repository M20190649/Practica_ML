q-Deformed Boson Oscillators and Zero Point Energy
Just as for the ordinary quantum harmonic oscillators, we expect the
zero-point energy to play a crucial role in the correct high temperature
behavior. We accordingly reformulate the theory of the statistical distribution
function for the q-deformed boson oscillators and develop an approximate theory
incorporating the zero-point energy. We are then able to demonstrate that for
small deformations, the theory reproduces the correct limits both for very high
temperatures and for very low temperatures. The deformed theory thus reduces to
the undeformed theory in these extreme cases.
