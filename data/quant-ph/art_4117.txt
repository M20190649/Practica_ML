Finite-precision measurement does not nullify the Kochen-Specker theorem
It is proven that any hidden variable theory of the type proposed by Meyer
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 83}, 3751 (1999)], Kent [{\em ibid.} {\bf 83}, 3755
(1999)], and Clifton and Kent [Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A {\bf 456}, 2101
(2000)] leads to experimentally testable predictions that are in contradiction
with those of quantum mechanics. Therefore, it is argued that the existence of
dense Kochen-Specker-colorable sets must not be interpreted as a nullification
of the physical impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem once the finite precision
of real measurements is taken into account.
