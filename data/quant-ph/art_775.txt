Equivalence between squeezed-state and twin-beam communication channels
We show the equivalence between two different communication schemes that
employ a couple of modes of the electromagnetic field. One scheme uses
unconventional heterodyne detection, with correlated signal and image-band
modes in a twin-beam state from parametric downconversion. The other scheme is
realized through a complex-number coding over quadrature-squeezed states of two
uncorrelated modes, each detected by ordinary homodyning. This equivalence
concerns all the stages of the communication channel: the encoded state, the
optimal amplifier for the channel, the master equation modeling the loss, and
the output measurement scheme. The unitary transformation that connects the two
communication schemes is realized by a frequency conversion device.
