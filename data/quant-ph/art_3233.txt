Cavity induced modifications to the resonance fluorescence and probe
  absorption of a laser-dressed V atom
A cavity-modified master equation is derived for a coherently driven, V-type
three-level atom coupled to a single-mode cavity in the bad cavity limit. We
show that population inversion in both the bare and dressed-state bases may be
achieved, originating from the enhancement of the atom-cavity interaction when
the cavity is resonant with an atomic dressed-state transition. The atomic
populations in the dressed state representation are analysed in terms of the
cavity-modified transition rates. The atomic fluorescence spectrum and probe
absorption spectrum also investigated, and it is found that the spectral
profiles may be controlled by adjusting the cavity frequency. Peak suppression
and line narrowing occur under appropriate conditions.
