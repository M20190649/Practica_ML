Perturbation theory for quantum-mechanical observables
The quantum-mechanical state vector is not directly observable even though it
is the fundamental variable that appears in Schrodinger's equation. In
conventional time-dependent perturbation theory, the state vector must be
calculated before the experimentally-observable expectation values of relevant
operators can be computed. We discuss an alternative form of time-dependent
perturbation theory in which the observable expectation values are calculated
directly and expressed in the form of nested commutators. This result is
consistent with the fact that the commutation relations determine the
properties of a quantum system, while the commutators often have a form that
simplifies the calculation and avoids canceling terms. The usefulness of this
method is illustrated using several problems of interest in quantum optics and
quantum information processing.
