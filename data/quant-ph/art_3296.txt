RISQ - reduced instruction set quantum computers
Candidates for quantum computing which offer only restricted control, e.g.,
due to lack of access to individual qubits, are not useful for general purpose
quantum computing. We present concrete proposals for the use of systems with
such limitations as RISQ - reduced instruction set quantum computers and
devices - for simulation of quantum dynamics, for multi-particle entanglement
and squeezing of collective spin variables. These tasks are useful in their own
right, and they also provide experimental probes for the functioning of quantum
gates in pre-mature proto-types of quantum computers.
