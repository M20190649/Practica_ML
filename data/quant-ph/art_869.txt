Correlations in interference and diffraction
Quantum formalism of Fraunhofer diffraction is obtained. The state of the
diffraction optical field is connected with the state of the incident optical
field by a diffraction factor. Based on this formalism, correlations of the
diffraction modes are calculated with different kinds of incident optical
fields. Influence of correlations of the incident modes on the diffraction
pattern is analyzed and an explanation of the ''ghost'' diffraction is
proposed.
