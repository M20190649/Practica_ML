Nondistortion Quantum Interrogation using EPR entangled Photons
We propose a novel scheme for nondistortion quantum interrogation (NQI),
defined as an interaction-free measurement which preserves the internal state
of the object being detected. In our scheme, two EPR entangled photons are used
as the probe and polarization sensitive measurements are performed at the four
ports of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In comparison with the previous
single photon scheme, it is shown that the two photon approach has a higher
probability of initial state preserving interrogation of an atom prepared in a
quantum superposition. In the case that the presence of the atom is not
successfully detected, the experiment can be repeated since the initial state
of the atom is unperturbed.
