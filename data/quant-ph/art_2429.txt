Single Spin State Detection for the Kane Model of Silicon-Based Quantum
  Computer
The scheme for measurement of the state of a single spin (or a few spin
system) based on the single-electron turnstile and injection of spin polarized
electrons from magnetic metal contacts is proposed. Applications to the recent
proposal concerning the spin gates based on a silicon matrix (B.Kane, Nature,
{\bf 393}, 133 (1998)) are discussed.
