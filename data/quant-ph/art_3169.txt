Atomic Quantum State Teleportation and Swapping
A set of protocols for atomic quantum state teleportation and swapping
utilizing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen light is proposed. The protocols are suitable
for collective spin states of a macroscopic sample of atoms, i.e. for
continuous atomic variables. Feasibility of experimental realization for
teleportation of a gas sample of atoms is analyzed.
