Single-Step Quantum Search Using Problem Structure
The structure of satisfiability problems is used to improve search algorithms
for quantum computers and reduce their required coherence times by using only a
single coherent evaluation of problem properties. The structure of random k-SAT
allows determining the asymptotic average behavior of these algorithms, showing
they improve on quantum algorithms, such as amplitude amplification, that
ignore detailed problem structure but remain exponential for hard problem
instances. Compared to good classical methods, the algorithm performs better,
on average, for weakly and highly constrained problems but worse for hard
cases. The analytic techniques introduced here also apply to other quantum
algorithms, supplementing the limited evaluation possible with classical
simulations and showing how quantum computing can use ensemble properties of NP
search problems.
