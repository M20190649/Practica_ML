su(1,1) coherent states and a normal extension of su(1,1) annihilation
  operator: squeezed states and the simultaneous measurement of Q^{-1}P+PQ^{-1}
  and Q^{-2}
The the over-complete eigenvector system of the operator Q^{-1}P (Q:position,
P:momentum) which consists of the squeezed states |0; s, t > with various s and
t are investigated from the viewpoint of the annihilation and creation
relations related to the algebra su(1,1). We derive a positive operator-valued
measure(POVM) for the simultaneous measurement between the self-adjoint and
anti-self-adjoint parts of PQ^{-1}.
