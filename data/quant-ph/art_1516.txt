Quantum Logic Gates in Optical Lattices
We propose a new system for implementing quantum logic gates: neutral atoms
trapped in a very far-off-resonance optical lattice. Pairs of atoms are made to
occupy the same well by varying the polarization of the trapping lasers, and
then a near-resonant electric dipole is induced by an auxiliary laser. A
controlled-NOT can be implemented by conditioning the target atomic resonance
on a resolvable level shift induced by the control atom. Atoms interact only
during logical operations, thereby suppressing decoherence.
