Self-Binding Transition in Bose Condensates with Laser-Induced
  ``Gravitation''
In our recent publication (D. O'Dell, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5687
(2000)) we proposed a scheme for electromagnetically generating a self-bound
Bose-Einstein condensate with 1/r attractive interactions: the analog of a Bose
star. Here we focus upon the conditions neccessary to observe the transition
from external trapping to self-binding. This transition becomes manifest in a
sharp reduction of the condensate radius and its dependence on the laser
intensity rather that the trap potential.
