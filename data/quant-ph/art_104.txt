A NOTE ON DEGENERATE AND ANAMOLOUS BOSONS
In this note it is shown that for a mono-energetic collection of Bosons, at a
certain (non-zero) momentum or temperature, there is condensation while there
is another momentum or temperature at which there is infinite dilution and
below which the gas exhibits anomalous Fermionic behaviour.
