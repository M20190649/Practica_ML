Optical scattering angles and Bose-stimulated motion in cold atomic gas
Bose statistics imply a substantial enhancement at small angles for light
scattering off a cold, Bose gas. The enhancement increases dramatically at the
Bose-Einstein temperature. This phenomenon could be utilized to eliminate
almost entirely the heating of the gas by a weak probe light beam.
