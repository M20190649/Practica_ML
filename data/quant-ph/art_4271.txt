Quantum Portfolios
Quantum computation holds promise for the solution of many intractable
problems. However, since many quantum algorithms are stochastic in nature they
can only find the solution of hard problems probabilistically. Thus the
efficiency of the algorithms has to be characterized both by the expected time
to completion {\it and} the associated variance. In order to minimize both the
running time and its uncertainty, we show that portfolios of quantum algorithms
analogous to those of finance can outperform single algorithms when applied to
the NP-complete problems such as 3-SAT.
