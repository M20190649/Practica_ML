Local environment can enhance fidelity of quantum teleportation
We show how an interaction with the environment can enhance fidelity of
quantum teleportation. To this end, we present examples of states which cannot
be made useful for teleportation by any local unitary transformations;
nevertheless, after being subjected to a dissipative interaction with the local
environment, the states allow for teleportation with genuinely quantum
fidelity. The surprising fact here is that the necessary interaction does not
require any intelligent action from the parties sharing the states. In passing,
we produce some general results regarding optimization of teleportation
fidelity by local action. We show that bistochastic processes cannot improve
fidelity of two-qubit states. We also show that in order to have their fidelity
improvable by a local process, the bipartite states must violate the so-called
reduction criterion of separability.
