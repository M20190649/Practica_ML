Using entanglement improves precision of quantum measurements
We show how entanglement can be used to improve the estimation of an unknown
transformation. Using entanglement is always of benefit, in improving either
the precision or the stability of the measurement. Examples relevant for
applications are illustrated, for either qubits and continuous variables
