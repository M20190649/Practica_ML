Quantum collision states for positive charges in an octahedral cage
One-electron energy levels are studied for a configuration of two positive
charges inside an octahedral cage, the vertices of the cage being occupied by
atoms with a partially filled shell. Although ground states correspond to large
separations, there are relatively low-lying states with large collision
probabilities. Electromagnetic radiation fields used to excite the quantum
collisional levels may provide a means to control nuclear reactions. However,
given the scale of the excitation energies involved, this mechanism cannot
provide an explanation for the unexplained ``cold fusion'' events.
