Spatial entanglement of twin quantum images
We show that spatial entanglement of two twin images obtained by parametric
down-conversion is complete, i.e. concerns both amplitude and phase. This is
realised through a homodyne detection of these images which allows for
measurement of the field quadrature components. EPR correlations are shown to
exist between symmetrical pixels of the two images. The best possible
correlation is obtained by adjusting the phase of the local oscillator field
(LO) in the area of maximal amplification. The results for quadrature
components hold unchanged even in absence of any input image i.e. for pure
parametric fluorescence. In this case they are not related to intensity and
phase fluctuations.
