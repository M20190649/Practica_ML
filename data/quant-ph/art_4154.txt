A Quantum-Mechanical Explanation of the Collapse of the Wave Function
The quantum field of a single particle is expressed as the sum of the
particle's ordinary wave function and the vacuum fluctuations. An exact
quantum-field calculation shows that the squared amplitude of this field sums,
at any time, to a delta function representing a discrete corpuscle at one point
and zero everywhere else. The peak of the delta function is located at the
point where the vacuum fluctuations interfere constructively with the ordinary
wave function. Similarly, the collapsed wave function after a measurement of an
observable is determined by interference between the initial wave function and
vacuum fluctuations.
