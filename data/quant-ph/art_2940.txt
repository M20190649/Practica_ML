Subdynamics as a mechanism for objective description
The relationship between microsystems and macrosystems is considered in the
context of quantum field formulation of statistical mechanics: it is argued
that problems on foundations of quantum mechanics can be solved relying on this
relationship. This discussion requires some improvement of non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics that is briefly presented.
