Quantum cryptography using balanced homodyne detection
We report an experimental quantum key distribution that utilizes balanced
homodyne detection, instead of photon counting, to detect weak pulses of
coherent light. Although our scheme inherently has a finite error rate, it
allows high-efficiency detection and quantum state measurement of the
transmitted light using only conventional devices at room temperature. When the
average photon number was 0.1, an error rate of 0.08 and "effective" quantum
efficiency of 0.76 were obtained.
