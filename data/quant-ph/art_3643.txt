Experimental Demonstration of Optimal Unambiguous State Discrimination
We present the first full demonstration of unambiguous state discrimination
between non-orthogonal quantum states. Using a novel free space interferometer
we have realised the optimum quantum measurement scheme for two non-orthogonal
states of light, known as the Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP) measurement. We have
for the first time gained access to all three possible outcomes of this
measurement. All aspects of this generalised measurement scheme, including its
superiority over a standard von Neumann measurement, have been demonstrated
within 1.5% of the IDP predictions.
