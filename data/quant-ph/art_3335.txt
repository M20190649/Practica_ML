Decoherence in a single trapped ion due to engineered reservoir
The decoherence in trapped ion induced by coupling the ion to the engineered
reservoir is studied in this paper. The engineered reservoir is simulated by
random variations in the trap frequency, and the trapped ion is treated as a
two-level system driven by a far off-resonant plane wave laser field. The
dependence of the decoherence rate on the amplitude of the superposition state
is given.
