Interaction of 3-level atom with radiation
The interaction of 3-level system with a quantum field in a non-equilibrium
state is considered. We describe a class of states of the quantum field for
wich a stationary state drives the system to inverse populated state. We find
that the quotient of the population of the energy levels in the simplest case
is described by the double Einstein formula which involves products of two
Einstein emission/absorption relations. Emission and absorption of radiation by
3-level atom in non-equlibrium stationary state is described.
