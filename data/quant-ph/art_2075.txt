Quantum cryptography on noisy channels: quantum versus classical
  key-agreement protocols
When the 4-state or the 6-state protocol of quantum cryptography is carried
out on a noisy (i.e. realistic) quantum channel, then the raw key has to be
processed to reduce the information of an adversary Eve down to an arbitrarily
low value, providing Alice and Bob with a secret key. In principle, quantum
algorithms as well as classical algorithms can be used for this processing. A
natural question is: up to which error rate on the raw key is a secret-key
agreement at all possible? Under the assumption of incoherent eavesdropping, we
find that the quantum and classical limits are precisely the same: as long as
Alice and Bob share some entanglement both quantum and classical protocols
provide secret keys.
