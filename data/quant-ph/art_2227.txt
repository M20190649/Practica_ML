Optimal generalized quantum measurements for arbitrary spin systems
Positive operator valued measurements on a finite number of N identically
prepared systems of arbitrary spin J are discussed. Pure states are
characterized in terms of Bloch-like vectors restricted by a SU(2 J+1)
covariant constraint. This representation allows for a simple description of
the equations to be fulfilled by optimal measurements. We explicitly find the
minimal POVM for the N=2 case, a rigorous bound for N=3 and set up the analysis
for arbitrary N.
