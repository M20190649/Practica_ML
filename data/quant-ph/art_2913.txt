Quantum Mechanics as Information Fusion
We provide evidence that quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a rational
algorithm for finding the least complex description for the correlations in the
outputs of sensors in a large array. In particular, by comparing the
self-organization approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with a
solution based on taking the classical limit of a Feynman path integral, we are
led to a connection between the quantum mechanics of motion in a magnetic field
and self-organized information fusion.
