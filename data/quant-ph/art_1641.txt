Epistemology of Quantization
A notion of quantization is proposed that is independent of the original
statistical interpretation of the distribution of energy in a photon gas or of
the quantization of angular momentum in hydrogen atom. Such a procedutre
implies the existance of finite space-time four-interval that any relativistic
preparation and measurement of a physical event requires. That finite
four-interval is also the epistemological source of QM uncertainty relations.
Furthermore, the consetrvation of helicity in the propagation of a photon is a
relativistic invariant, and is the origin of the "appearence" of a paradox of
nonlocal interaction in Bell's inequality [2,3,4] as shown in A. Aspect et all
[5] experiment. That is a spin of a photon is always correlated with its
momentum.
