Quantum computers can search arbitrarily large databases by a single
  query
This paper shows that a quantum mechanical algorithm that can query
information relating to multiple items of the database, can search a database
in a single query (a query is defined as any question to the database to which
the database has to return a (YES/NO) answer). A classical algorithm will be
limited to the information theoretic bound of at least O(log N) queries (which
it would achieve by using a binary search).
