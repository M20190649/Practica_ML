Supersymmetry in Stochastic Processes with Higher-Order Time Derivatives
A supersymmetric path integral representation is developed for stochastic
processes whose Langevin equation contains any number N of time derivatives,
thus generalizing the Langevin equation with inertia studied by Kramers, where
N=2. The supersymmetric action contains N fermion fields with first-order time
derivatives whose path integral is evaluated for fermionless asymptotic states.
