Hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics, Kahler structure, and
  Fisher information
The Schrodinger equation can be derived using the minimum Fisher information
principle. I discuss why such an approach should work, and also show that the
Kahler and Hilbert space structures of quantum mechanics result from combining
the symplectic structure of the hydrodynamical model with the Fisher
information metric.
