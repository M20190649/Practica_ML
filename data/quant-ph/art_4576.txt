J-matrix method and Bargmann potentials
By applying the J-matrix method [1] to neutral particles scattering we have
discovered that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonlocal
separable potential with the Laguerre form factors and a Bargmann potential.
Thus this discrete approach to direct and inverse scattering problem can be
considered as a tool of the S-matrix rational parametrization. As an
application, the Bargmann potentials, phase-equivalent to the np $^1S_0$
Yamaguchi potential [7] and to the np potential from inverse scattering in the
J-matrix approach [6] have been obtained.
