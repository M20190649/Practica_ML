Sensitivity optimization in quantum parameter estimation
We present a general framework for sensitivity optimization in quantum
parameter estimation schemes based on continuous (indirect) observation of a
dynamical system. As an illustrative example, we analyze the canonical scenario
of monitoring the position of a free mass or harmonic oscillator to detect weak
classical forces. We show that our framework allows the consideration of
sensitivity scheduling as well as estimation strategies for non-stationary
signals, leading us to propose corresponding generalizations of the Standard
Quantum Limit for force detection.
