Simplified quantum logic with trapped ions
We describe a simplified scheme for quantum logic with a collection of
laser-cooled trapped atomic ions. Building on the scheme of Cirac and Zoller,
we show how the fundamental controlled-NOT gate between a collective mode of
ion motion and the internal states of a single ion can be reduced to a single
laser pulse, and the need for a third auxiliary internal electronic state can
be eliminated.
