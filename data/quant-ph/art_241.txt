A simple quantum oblivious transfer protocol
A simple and efficient protocol for quantum oblivious transfer is proposed.
The protocol can easily be implemented with present technology and is secure
against cheaters with unlimited computing power provided the receiver does not
have the technology to store the particles for an arbitrarily long period of
time. The proposed protocol is a significant improvement over the previous
protocols. Unlike the protocol of Cr\'epeau and Kilian which is secure if only
if the spin of the particle is measured along the $x$ or the $y$ axis, the
present protocol is perfectly secure no matter along which axes the spin of the
particles are measured, and unlike the protocol of Bennett et al. which
requires tens of thousand of particles, the present protocol requires only two
particles.
