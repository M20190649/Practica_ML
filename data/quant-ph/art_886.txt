Quantum Computation and Decision Trees
Many interesting computational problems can be reformulated in terms of
decision trees. A natural classical algorithm is to then run a random walk on
the tree, starting at the root, to see if the tree contains a node n levels
from the root. We devise a quantum mechanical algorithm that evolves a state,
initially localized at the root, through the tree. We prove that if the
classical strategy succeeds in reaching level n in time polynomial in n, then
so does the quantum algorithm. Moreover, we find examples of trees for which
the classical algorithm requires time exponential in n, but for which the
quantum algorithm succeeds in polynomial time. The examples we have so far,
however, could also be solved in polynomial time by different classical
algorithms.
