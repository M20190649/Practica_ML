Comment on ``Experimental Separation of Geometric and Dynamical Phases
  Using Neutron Interferometry"
We analyse a recently reported neutron interference experiment to measure a
geometric phase and attempt to bring out the inadequacy of the ``phase modulo
2\pi" approach to the geometric phase. A modified neutron interferometer
experiment to observe 2n\pi phase changes of topological origin resulting from
closed circuits around singularities in the parameter space of the experiment
is proposed.
