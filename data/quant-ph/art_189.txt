Keplerian Squeezed States and Rydberg Wave Packets
We construct minimum-uncertainty solutions of the three-dimensional
Schr\"odinger equation with a Coulomb potential. These wave packets are
localized in radial and angular coordinates and are squeezed states in three
dimensions. They move on elliptical keplerian trajectories and are appropriate
for the description of the corresponding Rydberg wave packets, the production
of which is the focus of current experimental effort. We extend our analysis to
incorporate the effects of quantum defects in alkali-metal atoms, which are
used in experiments.
