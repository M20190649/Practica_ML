Quantum Computing
The main features of quantum computing are described in the framework of spin
resonance methods. Stress is put on the fact that quantum computing is in
itself nothing but a re-interpretation (fruitful indeed) of well-known
concepts. The role of the two basic operations, one-spin rotation and
controlled-NOT gates, is analyzed, and some exercises are proposed.
