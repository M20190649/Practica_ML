Quantum-Classical Correspondence: Controlling Quantum Transport by State
  Synthesis in Ion Traps
A procedure to enhance the quantum--classical correspondence even in
situations far from the classical limit is proposed. It is based on controlling
the quantum transport between classical regions using the capability to
synthesize arbitrary motional states in ion traps. Quantum barriers and
passages to transport can be created selecting the relevant frequencies. This
technique is then applied to stabilize the quantum motion onto classical
structures or alter the dynamical tunneling in nonintegrable systems.
