Semiclassical density of degeneracies in quantum regular systems
The spectrum of eigenenergies of a quantum integrable system whose
hamiltonian depends on a single parameter shows degeneracies (crossings) when
the parameter varies. We derive a semiclassical expression for the density of
crossings in the plane energy-parameter, that is the number of crossings per
unit of energy and unit of parameter, in terms of classical periodic orbits. We
compare the results of the semiclassical formula with exact quantum
calculations for two specific quantum integrable billiards.
