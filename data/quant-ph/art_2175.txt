Anomalies in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
It is shown that if a potential in a nonrelativistic system of Fermi
particles has a sufficiently strong singularity, anomalies (nonzero values of
quantities formally equal to zero) will probably appear. For different types of
singularities (in paticular, for the Coulomb potential), anomalies associated
with the energy and total number of particles in the system are calculated.
These anomalies may be beneficial in deriving a semiclassical description of
electron- nuclear systems.
