Alternative Forms of Generalized Vectors and Operators for Spin 1/2
The forms of the generalized quantities that we have recently introduced are
dependent on the phase of the probability amplitudes for spin-projection
measurements. In this paper, we show explicitly that changing the phase gives
different forms for both the spin vectors and spin operators. Therefore, there
are as many forms of these quantities as there are different choices of phase.
