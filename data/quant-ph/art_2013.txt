Green's function for the Relativistic Coulomb System via Sum Over
  Perturbation Series
We evaluate the Green's function of the D-dimensional relativistic Coulomb
system via sum over perturbation series which is obtained by expanding the
exponential containing the potential term $V({\bf x)}$ in the path integral
into a power series. The energy spectra and wave functions are extracted from
the resulting amplitude.
