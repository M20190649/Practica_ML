Ion-trap quantum logic using long-wavelength radiation
A quantum information processor is proposed that combines experimental
techniques and technology successfully demonstrated either in nuclear magnetic
resonance experiments or with trapped ions. An additional inhomogenenous
magnetic field applied to an ion trap i) shifts individual ionic resonances
(qubits), making them distinguishable by frequency, and, ii) mediates the
coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom of trapped ions. This
scheme permits one to individually address and coherently manipulate ions
confined in an electrodynamic trap using radiation in the radiofrequency or
microwave regime.
