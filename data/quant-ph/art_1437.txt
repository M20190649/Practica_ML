The Chiral Oscillator and its Applications in Quantum Theory
The fundamental importance of the chiral oscillator is elaborated. Its
quantum invariants are computed. As an application the Zeeman effect is
analysed. We also show that the chiral oscillator is the most basic example of
a duality invariant model, simulating the effect of the familiar
electric-magnetic duality.
