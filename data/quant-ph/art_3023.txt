Is Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics compatible with Duality
Supersymmetry applied to quantum mechanics has given new insights in various
topics of theoretical physics like analytically solvable potentials, WKB
approximation or KdV solitons. Duality plays a central role in many
supersymmetric theories such as Yang-Mills theories or strings models. We
investigate the possible existence of some duality within supersymmetric
quantum mechanics.
