On the Concept of Quantum State Reduction: Inconsistency of the Orthodox
  View
The argument is re-examined that the program of deriving the rule of state
reduction from the Schroedinger equation holding for the object-apparatus
composite system falls into a vicious circle or an infinite regress called the
von Neumann chain. It is shown that this argument suffers from a serious
physical inconsistency concerning the causality between the reading of the
outcome and the state reduction. A consistent argument which accomplishes the
above program without falling into the circular argument is presented.
