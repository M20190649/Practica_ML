Classical and quantum dynamics of a particle constrained on a circle
The Dirac method is used to analyze the classical and quantum dynamics of a
particle constrained on a circle. The method of Lagrange multipliers is
scrutinized, in particular in relation to the quantization procedure. Ordering
problems are tackled and solved by requiring the hermiticity of some operators.
The presence of an additional term in the quantum Hamiltonian is discussed.
