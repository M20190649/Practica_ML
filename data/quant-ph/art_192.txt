A True Equation to Couple Classical and Quantum Dynamics
Starting from the Schr\"odinger-equation of a composite system, we derive
unified dynamics of a classical harmonic system coupled to an arbitrary
quantized system. The classical subsystem is described by random phase-space
coordinates entangled with the quantized variables of the complementary
subsystem. Our semiclassical equation is {\it true} in a sense that its
predictions are identical to those of the fully quantized composite dynamics.
This exact method applies to a broad class of theories, including e.g. the
relativistic quantum-electrodynamics and the electron-fonon dynamics.
