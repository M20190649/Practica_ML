Codes for the Quantum Erasure Channel
The quantum erasure channel (QEC) is considered. Codes for the QEC have to
correct for erasures, i. e., arbitrary errors at known positions. We show that
four qubits are necessary and sufficient to encode one qubit and correct one
erasure, in contrast to five qubits for unknown positions. Moreover, a family
of quantum codes for the QEC, the quantum BCH codes, that can be efficiently
decoded is introduced.
