Quantum-Classical Complexity-Security Tradeoff In Secure Multi-Party
  Computation
I construct a secure multi-party scheme to compute a classical function by a
succinct use of a specially designed fault-tolerant random polynomial quantum
error correction code. This scheme is secure provided that (asymptotically)
strictly greater than five-sixths of the players are honest. Moreover, the
security of this scheme follows directly from the theory of quantum error
correcting code, and hence is valid without any computational assumption. I
also discuss the quantum-classical complexity-security tradeoff in secure
multi-party computation schemes and argue why a full-blown quantum code is
necessary in my scheme.
