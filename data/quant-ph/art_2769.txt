An Universal Quantum Network - Quantum CPU
An universal quantum network which can implement a general quantum computing
is proposed. In this sense, it can be called the quantum central processing
unit (QCPU). For a given quantum computing, its realization of QCPU is just its
quantum network. QCPU is standard and easy-assemble because it only has two
kinds of basic elements and two auxiliary elements. QCPU and its realizations
are scalable, that is, they can be connected together, and so they can
construct the whole quantum network to implement the general quantum algorithm
and quantum simulating procedure.
