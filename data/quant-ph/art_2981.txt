Complementarity between Position and Momentum as a Consequence of
  Kochen-Specker Arguments
We give two simple Kochen-Specker arguments for complementary between the
position and momentum components of spinless particles, arguments that are
identical in structure to those given by Peres and Mermin for spin-1/2
particles.
