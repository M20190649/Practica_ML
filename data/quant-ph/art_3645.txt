Multiparty multilevel Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
The proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities by Greenberger, Horne, and
Zeilinger (GHZ) is extended to multiparticle multilevel systems. The proposed
procedure generalizes previous partial results and provides an operational
characterization of the so-called GHZ states for multiparticle multilevel
systems.
