Dynamical Semigroup Description of Coherent and Incoherent
  Particle-Matter Interaction
The meaning of statistical experiments with single microsystems in quantum
mechanics is discussed and a general model in the framework of non-relativistic
quantum field theory is proposed, to describe both coherent and incoherent
interaction of a single microsystem with matter. Compactly developing the
calculations with superoperators, it is shown that the introduction of a time
scale, linked to irreversibility of the reduced dynamics, directly leads to a
dynamical semigroup expressed in terms of quantities typical of scattering
theory. Its generator consists of two terms, the first linked to a coherent
wavelike behaviour, the second related to an interaction having a measuring
character, possibly connected to events the microsystem produces propagating
inside matter. In case these events breed a measurement, an explicit
realization of some concepts of modern quantum mechanics ("effects" and
"operations") arises. The relevance of this description to a recent debate
questioning the validity of ordinary quantum mechanics to account for such
experimental situations as, e.g., neutron-interferometry, is briefly discussed.
