Quantum gates with neutral atoms: Controlling collisional interactions
  in time dependent traps
We theoretically study specific schemes for performing a fundamental
two-qubit quantum gate via controlled atomic collisions by switching
microscopic potentials. In particular we calculate the fidelity of a gate
operation for a configuration where a potential barrier between two atoms is
instantaneously removed and restored after a certain time. Possible
implementations could be based on microtraps created by magnetic and electric
fields, or potentials induced by laser light.
