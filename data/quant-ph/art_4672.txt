Optical quantum computer based on RDS crystal
We have proposed the construction of optical quantum computer (OQC) on
regular domain structure (RDS) crystal. By using RDS crystal, we can perform
all the logical operations on one RDS crystal. Moreover, RDS crystals are
parctically independent to the heating effects i.e., can perform logic
operations constantly without cooling the RDS crystal. Also, we have proposed
the quantum parallelsim i.e., parallel coherent laser beams are injected at the
input of the RDS crystals. By using the RDS crystal we can perform the reduce
the requirements of the linear and nonlinear optical components.
