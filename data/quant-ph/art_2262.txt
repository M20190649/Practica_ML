Quantum Computation as a Dynamical Process
In this paper, we discuss the dynamical issues of quantum computation. We
demonstrate that fast wave function oscillations can affect the performance of
Shor's quantum algorithm by destroying required quantum interference. We also
show that this destructive effect can be routinely avoided by using
resonant-pulse techniques. We discuss the dynamics of resonant pulse
implementations of quantum logic gates in Ising spin systems. We also discuss
the influence of non-resonant excitations. We calculate the range of parameters
where undesirable non-resonant effects can be minimized. Finally, we describe
the ``$2\pi k$-method'' which avoids the detrimental deflection of non-resonant
qubits.
