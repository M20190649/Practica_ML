Phases of Wave Functions and Level Repulsion
Avoided level crossings are associated with exceptional points which are the
singularities of the spectrum and eigenfunctions, when they are considered as
functions of a coupling parameter. It is shown that the wave function of {\it
one} state changes sign but not the other, if the exceptional point is
encircled in the complex plane. An experimental setup is suggested where this
peculiar phase change could be observed.
