Ponderomotive entangling of atomic motions
We propose the use of ponderomotive forces to entangle the motions of
different atoms. Two situations are analyzed: one where the atoms belong to the
same optical cavity and interact with the same radiation field mode; the other
where each atom is placed in own optical cavity and the output field of one
cavity enters the other.
