On The Significance of Bell's Locality Condition
Reviewing the general representation of a stochastic local hidden variables
theory in the context of an ideal Bohm's version of the EPR experiment, we show
explicitly that the violation of Bell's locality condition is due to the
assumption of ``outcome independence'' at the hidden variables level. Also, we
show that if we introduce determinism, the assumption of outcome independence
will be allowed.
