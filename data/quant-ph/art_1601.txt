On Quantum Algorithms for Noncommutative Hidden Subgroups
Quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm have previously been
generalized to finding hidden subgroups of finite Abelian groups. This paper
explores the possibility of extending this general viewpoint to finding hidden
subgroups of noncommutative groups. We present a quantum algorithm for the
special case of dihedral groups which determines the hidden subgroup in a
linear number of calls to the input function. We also explore the difficulties
of developing an algorithm to process the data to explicitly calculate a
generating set for the subgroup. A general framework for the noncommutative
hidden subgroup problem is discussed and we indicate future research
directions.
