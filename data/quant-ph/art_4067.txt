Squeezed light from spin squeezed atoms
We propose to produce pulses of strongly squeezed light by Raman scattering
of a strong laser pulse on a spin squeezed atomic sample. We prove that the
emission is restricted to a single field mode which perfectly inherits the
quantum correlations of the atomic system.
