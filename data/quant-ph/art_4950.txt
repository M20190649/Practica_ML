Dilemma and Quantum Battle of Sexes
We analysed quantum version of the game battle of sexes using a general
initial quantum state. For a particular choice of initial entangled quantum
state it is shown that the classical dilemma of the battle of sexes can be
resolved and a unique solution of the game can be obtained.
