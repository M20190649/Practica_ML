Exact solution for generalized pairing
An infinite dimensional algebra, which is useful for deriving exact solutions
of the generalized pairing problem, is introduced. A formalism for
diagonalizing the corresponding Hamiltonian is also proposed. The theory is
illustrated with some numerical examples.
