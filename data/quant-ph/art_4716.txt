The one-way quantum computer - a non-network model of quantum
  computation
A one-way quantum computer works by only performing a sequence of one-qubit
measurements on a particular entangled multi-qubit state, the cluster state. No
non-local operations are required in the process of computation. Any quantum
logic network can be simulated on the one-way quantum computer. On the other
hand, the network model of quantum computation cannot explain all ways of
processing quantum information possible with the one-way quantum computer. In
this paper, two examples of the non-network character of the one-way quantum
computer are given. First, circuits in the Clifford group can be performed in a
single time step. Second, the realisation of a particular circuit --the
bit-reversal gate-- on the one-way quantum computer has no network
interpretation. (Submitted to J. Mod. Opt, Gdansk ESF QIT conference issue.)
