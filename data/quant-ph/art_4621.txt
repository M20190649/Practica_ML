Franson-type experiment realizes two-qubit quantum logic gate
Quantum computers promise great improvements in solving problems such as
factoring large integers, simulating quantum systems, and database searching.
Using a photon as a quantum bit (qubit) is one of the most promising ways to
realize a universal quantum computer because the coherent superposition state
of a photon is very robust against various sources of decoherence. However, it
is too difficult to realize two-qubit (photon) gates because it requires huge
nonlinearity between photons. Here we show the realization of a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, the most important and elemental two-qubit gate for quantum
computation, by extending our previous research. The heart of our experiment is
the conditional measurement of two-photon coincidences in the Franson-type
experiment[7]. The photon counting measurement plays the same role as the
nonlinearity required for the two-qubit gate, and our system reproduces the
truth table of the CNOT gate. Furthermore, we create an entangled state from
the superposition state by our gate, which is clear evidence that our gate
works as a quantum logic gate. Our results make it possible to manipulate the
quantum state of photons including entanglement and represent significant
progress in the operation of various algorithms in quantum computation.
