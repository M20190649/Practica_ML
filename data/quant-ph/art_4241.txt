Quantum Digital Signatures
We present a quantum digital signature scheme whose security is based on
fundamental principles of quantum physics. It allows a sender (Alice) to sign a
message in such a way that the signature can be validated by a number of
different people, and all will agree either that the message came from Alice or
that it has been tampered with. To accomplish this task, each recipient of the
message must have a copy of Alice's "public key," which is a set of quantum
states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are
more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a
limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure.
However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital
signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each
recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute
quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using
one method of key distribution. The protocol provides a model for importing the
ideas of classical public key cryptography into the quantum world.
