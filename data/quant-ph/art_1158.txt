Quantum Convolutional Error Correcting Codes
I report two general methods to construct quantum convolutional codes for
$N$-state quantum systems. Using these general methods, I construct a quantum
convolutional code of rate 1/4, which can correct one quantum error for every
eight consecutive quantum registers.
