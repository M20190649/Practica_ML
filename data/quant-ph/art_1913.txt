TSQT `Elements of Possibility'?
I defend my arguments in quant-ph/9806002, which have recently been
criticized by L. Vaidman (quant-ph/9811092). I emphasize that the correct usage
of the ABL rule applies not to a genuine counterfactual statement but rather to
a conjunction of material conditionals. I argue that the only kind of valid
counterfactual statement one can make using the ABL rule is a ``might''
counterfactual, which is not adequate for the attribution of `elements of
reality' to a quantum system.
