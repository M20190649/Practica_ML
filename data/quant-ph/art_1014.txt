Interference phenomena in the photon production between two oscillating
  walls
We study the photon production in a 1D cavity whose left and right walls
oscillate with the frequency $\Omega_{L} $ and $\Omega_{R} $, respectively. For
$\Omega_{L} \neq \Omega_{R}, $ the number of generated photons by the
parametric resonance is the sum of the photon numbers produced when the left
and the right wall oscillates separately. But for $\Omega_{L} = \Omega_{R} $,
the interference term proportional to $\cos \phi $ is found additionally, where
$\phi $ is the phase difference between two oscillations of the walls.
