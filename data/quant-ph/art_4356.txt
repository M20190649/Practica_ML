Relaxation of a two-level system strongly coupled to a reservoir:
  Anomalously slow decoherence
Relaxation of a two-level system (TLS) into a resonant infinite-temperature
reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum is studied. The reservoir is described by
a complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the
TLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in
microwave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results
are obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\Omega_0\gg\nu$, where $\Omega_0$
is the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\nu$ is the width of the
reservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the
initial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the
decay occurs at $t\sim\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for
$t\ll(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\gg(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$ the
relaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the
coherence decays with the rate on the order of $\nu$, which may be slower by
orders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above
features are explained by the fact that at $t\ll\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir
temporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic). Moreover, we
identify the pointer basis, in which the reduction of the state vector occurs.
The pointer states are correlated with the reservoir, being dependent on the
reservoir phase.
