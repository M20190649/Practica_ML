General Schemes for multi-particle d-dimensional Cat-like State
  Teleportation
Two kinds of $M$-particle d-dimensional cat-like state teleportation
protocols are present. In the first protocol, the teleportation is achieved by
d-dimensional Bell-basis measurements, while in the second protocol it is
realized by d-dimensional GHZ-basis measurement. It is also shown that the
second protocol has a simple mathematical formulation that is identical to
Bennett et al's original teleportation protocol for an unknown state of a
single particle.
