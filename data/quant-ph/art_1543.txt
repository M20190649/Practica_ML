Force-Free Interactions and Nondispersive Phase Shifts in Interferometry
Zeilinger's observation that phenomena of the Aharonov-Bohm type lead to
nondispersive, i.e. energy-independent, phase shifts in interferometers is
generalized in a new proof which shows that the precise condition for
nondispersivity is a force-free interaction. The converse theorem is disproved
by a conceptual counter example. Applications to several nondispersive
interference phenomena are reviewed briefly. Those fall into two classes which
are objectively distinct from each other in that in the first class phase
shifts depend only on the topology of the interfering beam paths while in the
second class force-free physical interactions take place at identifiable points
along the path. Apparent disagreements in the literature about the topological
nature of the phenomena in the second class stem from differing definitions.
