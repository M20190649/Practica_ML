NMR Based Quantum Information Processing: Achievements and Prospects
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides an experimental setting to explore
physical implementations of quantum information processing (QIP). Here we
introduce the basic background for understanding applications of NMR to QIP and
explain their current successes, limitations and potential. NMR spectroscopy is
well known for its wealth of diverse coherent manipulations of spin dynamics.
Ideas and instrumentation from liquid state NMR spectroscopy have been used to
experiment with QIP. This approach has carried the field to a complexity of
about 10 qubits, a small number for quantum computation but large enough for
observing and better understanding the complexity of the quantum world. While
liquid state NMR is the only present-day technology about to reach this number
of qubits, further increases in complexity will require new methods. We sketch
one direction leading towards a scalable quantum computer using spin 1/2
particles. The next step of which is a solid state NMR-based QIP capable of
reaching 10-30 qubits.
