Toward Quantum Behavioral Finances: Bohmian Approach
We apply methods of quantum mechanics for mathematical modeling of price
dynamics at the financial market. We propose to describe behavioral financial
factors (e.g., expectations of traders) by using the pilot wave (Bohmian) model
of quantum mechanics. Trajectories of prices are determined by two financial
potentials: classical-like $V(q)$ ("hard" market conditions, e.g., natural
resources) and quantum-like $U(q)$ (behavioral market conditions). On one hand,
our Bohmian model is a quantum-like model for the financial market, cf. with
works of W. Segal, I. E. Segal, E. Haven, E. W.Piotrowski, J. Sladkowski. On
the other hand, (since Bohmian mechanics provides the possibility to describe
individual price trajectories) it belongs to the domain of extended research on
deterministic dynamics for financial assets (C.W. J. Granger, W.A. Barnett, A.
J. Benhabib, W.A. Brock, C. Sayers, J. Y. Campbell, A. W. Lo, A. C. MacKinlay,
A. Serletis, S. Kuchta, M. Frank, R. Gencay, T. Stengos, M. J. Hinich, D.
Patterson, D. A. Hsieh, D. T. Caplan, J.A. Scheinkman, B. LeBaron and many
others).
