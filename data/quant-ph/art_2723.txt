Two-state teleportation
Quantum teleportation with additional a priori information about the input
state achieves higher fidelity than teleportation of a completely unknown
state. However, perfect teleportation of two non-orthogonal input states
requires the same amount of entanglement as perfect teleportation of an unknown
state, namely one ebit. We analyse how well two-state teleportation can be
achieved using every degree of pure-state entanglement, and discuss the
fidelity of `teleportation' that can be achieved with only classical
communication but no shared entanglement. A two-state telecloning scheme is
constructed.
