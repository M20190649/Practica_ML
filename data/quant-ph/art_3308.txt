Quantum state protection using all-optical feedback
An all-optical feedback scheme in which the output of a cavity mode is used
to influence the dynamics of another cavity mode is considered. We show that
under ideal conditions, perfect preservation against decoherence of a generic
quantum state of the source mode can be achieved.
