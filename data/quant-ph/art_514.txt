Negative Binomial and Multinomial States: probability distributions and
  coherent states
Following the relationship between probability distribution and coherent
states, for example the well known Poisson distribution and the ordinary
coherent states and relatively less known one of the binomial distribution and
the $su(2)$ coherent states, we propose ``interpretation'' of $su(1,1)$ and
$su(r,1)$ coherent states ``in terms of probability theory''. They will be
called the ``negative binomial'' (``multinomial'') ``states'' which correspond
to the ``negative'' binomial (multinomial) distribution, the non-compact
counterpart of the well known binomial (multinomial) distribution. Explicit
forms of the negative binomial (multinomial) states are given in terms of
various boson representations which are naturally related to the probability
theory interpretation. Here we show fruitful interplay of probability theory,
group theory and quantum theory.
