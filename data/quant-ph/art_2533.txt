A simple proof of the converse of Hardy's theorem
In this paper we provide a simple proof of the fact that for a system of two
spin-1/2 particles, and for a choice of observables, there is a unique state
which shows Hardy-type nonlocality. Moreover, an explicit expression for the
probability that an ensemble of particle pairs prepared in such a state
exhibits a Hardy-type nonlocality contradiction is given in terms of two
independent parameters related to the observables involved. Incidentally, a
wrong statement expressed in Mermin's proof of the converse [N.D. Mermin, Am.
J. Phys. 62, 880 (1994)] is pointed out.
