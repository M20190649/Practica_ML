Explicitly solvable cases of one-dimensional quantum chaos
We identify a set of quantum graphs with unique and precisely defined
spectral properties called {\it regular quantum graphs}. Although chaotic in
their classical limit with positive topological entropy, regular quantum graphs
are explicitly solvable. The proof is constructive: we present exact periodic
orbit expansions for individual energy levels, thus obtaining an analytical
solution for the spectrum of regular quantum graphs that is complete, explicit
and exact.
