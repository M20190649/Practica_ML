Quantum Gates and Clifford Algebras
Clifford algebras are used for definition of spinors. Because of using
spin-1/2 systems as an adequate model of quantum bit, a relation of the
algebras with quantum information science has physical reasons. But there are
simple mathematical properties of the algebras those also justifies such
applications.
  First, any complex Clifford algebra with 2n generators, Cl(2n,C), has
representation as algebra of all 2^n x 2^n complex matrices and so includes
unitary matrix of any quantum n-gate. An arbitrary element of whole algebra
corresponds to general form of linear complex transformation. The last property
is also useful because linear operators are not necessary should be unitary if
they used for description of restriction of some unitary operator to subspace.
  The second advantage is simple algebraic structure of Cl(2n) that can be
expressed via tenzor product of standard "building units" and similar with
behavior of composite quantum systems. The compact notation with 2n generators
also can be used in software for modeling of simple quantum circuits by modern
conventional computers.
