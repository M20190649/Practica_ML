What Do These Correlations Know About Reality? Nonlocality and the
  Absurd
In honor of Daniel Greenberger's 65th birthday I record for posterity two
superb examples of his wit, offer a proof of an important theorem on quantum
correlations that even those of us over 60 can understand, and suggest, by
trying to make it look silly, that invoking ``quantum nonlocality'' as an
explanation for such correlations may be too cheap a way out of the dilemma
they pose.
