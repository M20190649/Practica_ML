Comments on ``Differential cross section for Aharonov-Bohm effect with
  nonstandard boundary conditions''
We show that the violation of rotational symmetry for differential cross
section for Aharonov-Bohm effect with nonstandard boundary conditions has been
known for some time. Moreover, the results were applied to discuss the Hall
effect and persistent currents of fermions in a plane pierced by a flux tube.
