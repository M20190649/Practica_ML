How to Trap Photons? Storing Single-Photon Quantum States in Collective
  Atomic Excitations
We show that it is possible to ``store'' quantum states of single-photon
fields by mapping them onto {\it collective} meta-stable states of an optically
dense, coherently driven medium inside an optical resonator. An adiabatic
technique is suggested which allows to transfer non-classical correlations from
traveling-wave single-photon wave-packets into atomic states and vise versa
with nearly 100% efficiency. In contrast to previous approaches involving
single atoms, the present technique does not require the strong coupling regime
corresponding to high-Q micro-cavities. Instead, intracavity
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency is used to achieve a strong coupling
between the cavity mode and the atoms.
