Dark-State Polaritons in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency
We identify form-stable coupled excitations of light and matter (``dark-state
polaritons'') associated with the propagation of quantum fields in
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. The properties of the dark-state
polaritons such as the group velocity are determined by the mixing angle
between light and matter components and can be controlled by an external
coherent field as the pulse propagates. In particular, light pulses can be
decelerated and ``trapped'' in which case their shape and quantum state are
mapped onto metastable collective states of matter. Possible applications of
this reversible coherent-control technique are discussed.
