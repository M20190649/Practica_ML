Reply to "On Stapp's`Nonlocal Character of Quantum Theory' "
The question raised by Shimony and Stein is examined and used to explain in
more detail a key point of my proof that any theory that conforms to certain
general ideas of orthodox relativistic quantum field theory must permit
transfers of information over spacelike intervals. It is also explained why
this result is not a problem for relativistic quantum theory, but, on the
contrary, opens the door to a satisfactory realistic relativistic quantum
theory based on the ideas of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and von Neumann.
