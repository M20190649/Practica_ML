The Mach-Zehnder and the Teleporter
We suggest a self-testing teleportation configuration for photon q-bits based
on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. That is, Bob can tell how well the input
state has been teleported without knowing what that input state was. One could
imagine building a "locked" teleporter based on this configuration. The
analysis is performed for continuous variable teleportation but the arrangement
could equally be applied to discrete manipulations.
