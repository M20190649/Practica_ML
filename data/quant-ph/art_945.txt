Reflection time and the Goos-HÃ¤nchen effect for reflection by a
  semi-infinite rectangular barrier
The reflection time, during which a particle is in the classically forbidden
region, is described by the trajectory representation for reflection by a
semi-infinite rectangular barrier. The Schr\"odinger wave function has
microstates for such reflection. The reflection time is a function of the
microstate. For oblique reflection, the Goos-H\"anchen displacement is also a
function of the microstate. For a square well duct, we develop a proposed test
where consistent overdetermination of the trajectory by a redundant set of
observed constants of the motion would be beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.
