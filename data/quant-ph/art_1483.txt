Decoherence, Einselection, and the Existential Interpretation (the Rough
  Guide)
The roles of decoherence and environment-induced superselection in the
emergence of the classical from the quantum substrate are described. The
stability of correlations between the einselected quantum pointer states and
the environment allows them to exist almost as objectively as classical states
were once thought to exist: There are ways of finding out what is the pointer
state of the system which utilize redundancy of their correlations with the
environment, and which leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This
relatively objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates
operational definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once
there are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse' in the
traditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it has already
happened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective
collapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of
information is emphasized. The existential interpretation based on the
relatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected
states of observers memory and in the outside Universe is formulated and
discussed.
