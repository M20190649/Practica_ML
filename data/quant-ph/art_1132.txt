Grover's quantum searching algorithm is optimal
I improve the tight bound on quantum searching by Boyer et al.
(quant-ph/9605034) to a matching bound, thus showing that for any probability
of success Grovers quantum searching algorithm is optimal. E.g. for near
certain success we have to query the oracle pi/4 sqrt{N} times, where N is the
size of the search space. I also show that unfortunately quantum searching
cannot be parallelized better than by assigning different parts of the search
space to independent quantum computers. Earlier results left open the
possibility of a more efficient parallelization.
