Quantum Holographic Teleportation of Light Fields
We describe a continious variable teleportation scheme that allows to
teleport the quantum state of distributed in space-time multimode
electromagnetic field. Our teleportation protocol uses the spatially-multimode
entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen lihgt beams. We evaluate the "resolving
power" of teleportation in space-time and specify the degrees of freedom of
electromagnetic field whose quantum state can be effectively teleported. We
call this scheme "quantum holographic teleportation" because it can be
considered as an extension of conventional holography to quantum domain.
