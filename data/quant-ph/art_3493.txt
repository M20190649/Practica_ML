Sampling functions for multimode homodyne tomography with a single local
  oscillator
We derive various sampling functions for multimode homodyne tomography with a
single local oscillator. These functions allow us to sample multimode
s-parametrized quasidistributions, density matrix elements in Fock basis, and
s-ordered moments of arbitrary order directly from the measured quadrature
statistics. The inevitable experimental losses can be compensated by proper
modification of the sampling functions. Results of Monte Carlo simulations for
squeezed three-mode state are reported and the feasibility of reconstruction of
the three-mode Q-function and s-ordered moments from 10^7 sampled data is
demonstrated.
