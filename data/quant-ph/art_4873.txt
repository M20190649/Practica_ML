A non-local, Lorentz-invariant, hidden-variable interpretation of
  relativistic quantum mechanics based on particle trajectories
We demonstrate how to construct a lorentz-invariant, hidden-variable
interpretation of relativistic quantum mechanics based on particle
trajectories. The covariant theory that we propose employs a multi-time
formalism and a lorentz-invariant rule for the coordination of the space-time
points on the individual particle trajectories. In this way we show that there
is no contradiction between nonlocality and lorentz invariance in quantum
mechanics. The approach is illustrated for relativistic bosons, using a simple
model to discuss the individual non-locally correlated particle motion which
ensues when the wavefunction is entangled. A simple example of measurement is
described.
