Lindblad Approach to Nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings Dynamics of a Trapped Ion
The Lindblad approach to open quantum systems is introduced for studying the
dynamics of a single trapped ion prepared in nonclassical motional states and
subjected to continuous measurement of its internal population. This results in
an inhibition of the dynamics similar to the one occurring in the quantum Zeno
effect. In particular, modifications to the Jaynes-Cummings collapses and
revivals arising from an initial coherent state of motion in various regimes of
interaction with the driving laser are dealt in detail.
