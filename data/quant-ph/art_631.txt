Cooperative loss and decoherence in quantum computation and commuication
Cooperative effects in the loss (the amplitude damping) and decoherence (the
phase damping) of the qubits (two-state quantum systems) due to the inevitable
coupling to the same environment are investigated. It is found that the qubits
undergo the dissipation coherently in this case. In particular, for a special
kind of input states (called the coherence-preserving states), whose form
depends on the type of the coupling, loss and decoherence in quantum memory are
much reduced. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme by encoding the general input
states of the qubits into the corresponding coherence-preserving states is
proposed for reducing the cooperative loss and decoherence in quantum
computation or communication.
