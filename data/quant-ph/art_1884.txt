Creation of coherent atomic superpositions by fractional STIRAP
We discuss a simple scheme for preparing atoms and molecules in an arbitrary
preselected coherent superposition of quantum states. The technique, which we
call fractional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ({\it f-STIRAP}), is based
upon (incomplete) adiabatic population transfer between an initial state
$\psi_1$ and state $\psi_3$ through an intermediate state $\psi_2$. As in
STIRAP, the Stokes pulse arrives before the pump pulse, but unlike STIRAP, the
two pulses terminate simultaneously while maintaining a constant ratio of
amplitudes. The independence of f-STIRAP from details of pulse shape and pulse
area makes it the analog of conventional STIRAP in the creation of coherent
superpositions of states. We suggest a smooth realization of f-STIRAP which
requires only two laser pulses (which can be derived from a single laser) and
at the same time ensures the automatic fulfillment of the asymptotic conditions
at early and late times. Furthermore, we provide simple analytic estimates of
the robustness of f-STIRAP against variations in the pulse intensity, the pulse
delay, and the intermediate-state detuning, and discuss its possible extension
to multistate systems.
