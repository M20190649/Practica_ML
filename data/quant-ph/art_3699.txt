Template-stripped gold surfaces with 0.4 nm rms roughness suitable for
  force measurements. Application to the Casimir force in the 20-100 nm range
Using a template-stripping method, macroscopic gold surfaces with
root-mean-square (rms) roughness less than 0.4 nm have been prepared, making
them useful for studies of surface interactions in the nanometer range. The
utility of such substrates is demonstrated by measurements of the Casimir force
at surface separations between 20 and 100 nm, resulting in good agreement with
theory. The significance and quantification of this agreement is addressed, as
well as some methodological aspects regarding the measurement of the Casimir
force with high accuracy.
