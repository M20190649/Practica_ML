Algorithms on Ensemble Quantum Computers
In ensemble (or bulk) quantum computation, measurements of qubits in an
individual computer cannot be performed. Instead, only expectation values can
be measured. As a result of this limitation on the model of computation,
various important algorithms cannot be processed directly on such computers,
and must be modified. We provide modifications of various existing protocols,
including algorithms for universal fault--tolerant computation, Shor's
factorization algorithm (which can be extended to any algorithm computing an NP
function), and some search algorithms to enable processing them on ensemble
quantum computers.
