Remarks on the semi-classical theory of three state system
The semi-classical solution of the three state system is considered to study
the population inversion at and away from resonance. At resonance, it is shown
that if the system is initially populated either in the upper or in the lower
level, then the population oscillation occurs in a way which is quite different
from that if it is initially populated in the middle state. At off resonance,
there is gradual suppression of the population in the excited states and in the
asymptotic limit of the detuning, the system returns to its initial state.
