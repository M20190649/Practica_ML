What is an atom laser?
An atom laser is a hypothetical device which would produce an atomic field
analogous to the electromagnetic field of a photon laser. Here I argue that for
this analogy to be meaningful it is necessary to have a precise definition of a
laser which applies equally to photon or atom lasers. The definition I propose
is based upon the principle that the output of a laser is well-approximated by
a classical wave of fixed intensity and phase. This principle yields four
quantitative conditions which the output of a device must satisfy in order for
that device to be considered a laser. While explaining these requirements, I
analyse the similarities and differences between atom and photon lasers. I show
how these conditions are satisfied first by an idealized photon laser model,
and then by a more generic model which can apply to atom lasers also. Lastly, I
briefly discuss the current proposals for atom lasers and whether they could be
true lasers.
