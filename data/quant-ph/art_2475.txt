Bell's inequality for a single spin 1/2 particle and quantum
  contextuality
We argue that for a \emph{single particle} Bell's inequality is a consequence
of noncontextuality and is \emph{incompatible} with statistical predictions of
quantum mechanics. Thus noncontextual models can be empirically falsified,
\emph{independent} of locality condition. For this an appropriate entanglement
between \emph{disjoint} Hilbert spaces pertaining to translational and spin
degrees of freedom of a single spin-1/2 particle is invoked
