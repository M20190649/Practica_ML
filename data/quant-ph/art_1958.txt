Dispersion in Femtosecond Entangled Two-Photon Interference
We theoretically investigate the quantum interference of entangled two-photon
states generated in a nonlinear crystal pumped by femtosecond optical pulses.
Interference patterns generated by the polarization analog of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer are studied. Attention is devoted to the effects
of the pump-pulse profile (pulse duration and chirp) and the second-order
dispersion in both the nonlinear crystal and the interferometer's optical
elements. Dispersion causes the interference pattern to have an asymmetric
shape. Dispersion cancellation occurs in some cases.
