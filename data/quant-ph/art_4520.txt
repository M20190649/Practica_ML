The stuff the world is made of: physics and reality
Taking into account the results that we have been obtained during the last
decade in the foundations of quantum mechanic we put forward a view on reality
that we call the 'creation discovery view'. In this view it is made explicit
that a measurement is an act of a macroscopic physical entity on a
microphysical entity that entails the creation of new elements of reality as
well as the detection of existing elements of reality. Within this view most of
the quantum mechanical paradoxes are due to structural shortcomings of the
standard quantum theory, which means that our analysis agrees with the claim
made in the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paper, namely that standards quantum
mechanics is an incomplete theory. This incompleteness is however not due to
the absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum
mechanics to describe separated quantum entities. Nonlocality appears as a
genuine property of nature in our view and makes it necessary to reconsider the
role of space in reality. Our proposal for a new interpretation for space makes
it possible to put forward an new hypothesis for why it has not been possible
to unify quantum mechanics and relativity theory.
