A New Method to Derive Low-Lying N-dimensional Quantum Wave Functions by
  Quadratures Along a Single Trajectory
We present a new method to derive low-lying N-dimensional quantum wave
functions by quadrature along a single trajectory. The N-dimensional
Schroedinger equation is cast into a series of readily integrable first order
ordinary differential equations. Our approach resembles the familiar W.K.B.
approximation in one dimension, but is designed to explore the classically
forbidden region and has a much wider applicability than W.K.B.. The method
also provides a perturbation series expansion and the Green's functions of the
wave equation in N-dimension, all by quadratures along a single trajectory. A
number of examples are given for illustration, including a simple algorithm to
evaluate the Stark effect in closed form to any finite order of the electric
field.
