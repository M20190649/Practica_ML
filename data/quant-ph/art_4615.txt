Whose Knowledge?
Sir Rudolph Peierls, in a reply to John Bell's last critique of the state of
our understanding of quantum mechanics, maintained that it is easy to give an
acceptable account of the physical significance of the quantum theory. The key
is to recognize that all the density matrix characterizing a physical system
ever represents is knowledge about that system. In answer to Bell's implicit
rejoinder "Whose knowledge?" Peierls offered two simple consistency conditions
that must be satisfied by density matrices that convey the knowledge different
people might have about one and the same physical system: their density
matrices must commute and must have a non-zero product. I describe a simple
counterexample to his first condition, but show that his second condition,
which holds trivially if the first does, continues to be valid in its absence.
It is an open question whether any other conditions must be imposed.
