Equivalence of the grand canonical partition functions of particles with
  different statistics
It is shown that the grand partition function of an ideal Bose system with
single particle spectrum $\epsilon_i = (2n+k+3/2)\hbar\omega$ is identical to
that of a system of particles with single particle energy $\epsilon_i
=(n+1/2)\hbar\omega$ and obeying a particular kind of statistics based on the
permutation group.
