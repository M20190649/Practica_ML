Angular Velocity Operator and Barnett-Pegg Formalism
We define a new operator within Barnett-Pegg formalism for phase angle. The
physical predictions for this operator correspond to those expected of an
angular velocity operator. Examples studied are particle on a circle with and
without magnetic field and quantum harmonic oscillator.
