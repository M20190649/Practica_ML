How fast can a quantum computer search?
This paper gives a simple proof of why a quantum computer, despite being in
all possible states simultaneously, needs at least 0.707 sqrt(N) queries to
retrieve a desired item from an unsorted list of items. The proof is refined to
show that a quantum computer would need at least 0.785 sqrt(N) queries. The
quantum search algorithm needs precisely this many queries.
