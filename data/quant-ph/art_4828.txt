Necessary conditions for the efficient simulation of Hamiltonians using
  local unitary operations
We study necessary conditions for the efficient simulation of both bipartite
and multipartite Hamiltonians, which are independent of the eigenvalues and
based on the algebraic-geometric invariants introduced in [1-2]. Our results
indicate that the problem of efficient simulation of Hamiltonians for arbitrary
and multipartite quantum systems cannot be described by using only eigenvalues,
unlike that in the two-qubit case.
