A simple eavesdropping strategy of BB84 protocol
A simplified eavesdropping-strategy for BB84 protocol in quantum cryptography
(refer to quant-ph/9812022) is proposed. This scheme implements by the
`indirect copying' technology. Under this scheme, eavesdropper can exactly
obtain the exchanged information between the legitimate users without being
detected.
