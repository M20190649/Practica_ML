Comment on ``A new efficient method for calculating perturbative
  energies using functions which are not square integrable'': regularization
  and justification
The method recently proposed by Skala and Cizek for calculating perturbation
energies in a strict sense is ambiguous because it is expressed as a ratio of
two quantities which are separately divergent. Even though this ratio comes out
finite and gives the correct perturbation energies, the calculational process
must be regularized to be justified. We examine one possible method of
regularization and show that the proposed method gives traditional quantum
mechanics results.
