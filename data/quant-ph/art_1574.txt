An efficient scheme for the deterministic maximal entanglement of N
  trapped ions
We propose a method for generating maximally entangled states of N two-level
trapped ions. The method is deterministic and independent of the number of ions
in the trap. It involves a controlled-NOT acting simultaneously on all the ions
through a dispersive interaction. We explore the potential application of our
scheme for high precision frequency standards.
