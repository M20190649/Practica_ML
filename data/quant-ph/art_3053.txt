Probabilistic quantum cloning via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
We propose a probabilistic quantum cloning scheme using
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, Bell basis measurements, single-qubit
unitary operations and generalized measurements, all of which are within the
reach of current technology. Compared to another possible scheme via Tele-CNOT
gate [D. Gottesman and I. L. Chuang, Nature 402, 390 (1999)], the present
scheme may be used in experiment to clone the states of one particle to those
of two different particles with higher probability and less GHZ resources.
