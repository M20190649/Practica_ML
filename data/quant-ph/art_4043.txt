The physics of forgetting: Landauer's erasure principle and information
  theory
This article discusses the concept of information and its intimate
relationship with physics. After an introduction of all the necessary quantum
mechanical and information theoretical concepts we analyze Landauer's principle
that states that the erasure of information is inevitably accompanied by the
generation of heat. We employ this principle to rederive a number of results in
classical and quantum information theory whose rigorous mathematical
derivations are difficult. This demonstrates the usefulness of Landauer's
principle and provides an introduction to the physical theory of information.
