Gaussian Wigner distributions and hierarchies of nonclassical states in
  quantum optics-The single mode case
A recently introduced hierarchy of states of a single mode quantised
radiation field is examined for the case of centered Guassian Wigner
distributions. It is found that the onset of squeezing among such states
signals the transition to the strongly nonclassical regime. Interesting
consequences for the photon number distribution, and explicit representations
for them, are presented.
