Information gain versus state disturbance for a single qubit
The trade-off between the information gain and the state disturbance is
derived for quantum operations on a single qubit prepared in a uniformly
distributed pure state. The derivation is valid for a class of measures
quantifying the state disturbance and the information gain which satisfy
certain invariance conditions. This class includes in particular the Shannon
entropy versus the operation fidelity. The central role in the derivation is
played by efficient quantum operations, which leave the system in a pure output
state for any measurement outcome. It is pointed out that the optimality of
efficient quantum operations among those inducing a given operator-valued
measure is related to Davies' characterization of convex invariant functions on
hermitian operators.
