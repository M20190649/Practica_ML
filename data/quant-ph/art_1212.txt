Borel Summable Solutions to 1D Schr√∂dinger Equation
It is shown that so called fundamental solutions the semiclassical expansions
of which have been established earlier to be Borel summable to the solutions
themselves appear also to be the unique solutions to the 1D Schr\"odinger
equation having this property. Namely, it is shown in this paper that for the
polynomial potentials the Borel function defined by the fundamental solutions
can be considered as the canonical one. The latter means that any Borel
summable solution can be obtained by the Borel transformation of this unique
canonical Borel function multiplied by some $\hbar$-dependent and Borel
summable constant. This justify the exceptional role the fundamental solutions
play in 1D quantum mechanics and completes the relevant semiclassical theory
relied on the Borel resummation technique and developed in our other papers.
