Spin squeezing of mixed systems
The notion of spin squeezing has been discussed in this paper using the
density matrix formalism. Extending the definition of squeezing for pure states
given by Kitagawa and Ueda in an appropriate manner and employing the spherical
tensor representation, we show that mixed spin states which are non-oriented
and possess vector polarization indeed exhibit squeezing. We construct a mixed
state of a spin 1 system using two spin 1/2 states and study its squeezing
behaviour as a function of the individual polarizations of the two spinors.
