Hidden variables, quasi-sets, and elementary particles
We have recently showed that it is possible to deal with collections of
indistinguishable elementary particles (in the context of quantum mechanics) in
a set-theoretical framework by using hidden variables, in a sense. In the
present paper we use such a formalism as a model for quasi-set theory.
Quasi-set theory, based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, was developed for
dealing with collections of indistinguishable but, in a sense, not identical
objects.
