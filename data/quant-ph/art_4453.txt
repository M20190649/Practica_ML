Covariance and Fisher information in quantum mechanics
Variance and Fisher information are ingredients of the Cramer-Rao inequality.
We regard Fisher information as a Riemannian metric on a quantum statistical
manifold and choose monotonicity under coarse graining as the fundamental
property of variance and Fisher information. In this approach we show that
there is a kind of dual one-to-one correspondence between the candidates of the
two concepts. We emphasis that Fisher informations are obtained from relative
entropies as contrast functions on the state space and argue that the scalar
curvature might be interpreted as an uncertainty density on a statistical
manifold.
