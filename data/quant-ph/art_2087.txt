Formulation of the Classical Mechanics in the Ring of Operators
By making use of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal association rules, a
commutative product and a new quantum bracket are constructed in the ring of
operators \cal{F}(H). In this way, an isomorphism between Lie algebra of
classical observables (with Poisson bracket) and the Lie algebra of quantum
observables with this new bracket is established. By these observations, a
formulation of the classical mechanics in \cal{F}(H} is obtained and is shown
to be \hbar\to 0 limit of the Heisenberg picture formulation of the quantum
mechanics.
