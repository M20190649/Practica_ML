Cold atoms: A new medium for quantum optics
Laser-cooled and trapped cesium atoms have been used as a nonlinear medium in
a nearly resonant cavity. A study of the semiclassical dynamics of the system
was performed, showing bistability and instabilities. In the quantum domain,
squeezing in a probe beam having interacted with this system was demonstrated.
