Simple computer model for the quantum Zeno effect
This paper presents a simple model for repeated measurement of a quantum
system: the evolution of a free particle, simulated by discretising the
particle's position. This model is easily simulated by computer and provides a
useful arena to investigate the effects of measurement upon dynamics, in
particular the slowing of evolution due to measurement (the `quantum Zeno
effect'). The results of this simulation are discussed for two rather different
sorts of measurement process, both of which are (simplified forms of)
measurements used in previous simulations of position measurement. A number of
interesting results due to measurement are found, and the investigation casts
some light on previous disagreements about the presence or absence of the Zeno
effect.
