Decoherence-Free Subspaces for Multiple-Qubit Errors: (II) Universal,
  Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation
Decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs) shield quantum information from errors
induced by the interaction with an uncontrollable environment. Here we study a
model of correlated errors forming an Abelian subgroup (stabilizer) of the
Pauli group (the group of tensor products of Pauli matrices). Unlike previous
studies of DFSs, this type of errors does not involve any spatial symmetry
assumptions on the system-environment interaction. We solve the problem of
universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation on the associated class of DFSs.
