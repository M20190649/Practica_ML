NP in BQP with Nonlinearity
If one modifies the laws of Quantum Mechanics to allow nonlinear evolution of
quantum states, this paper shows that NP-complete problems would be efficiently
solvable in polynomial time with bounded probability (NP in BQP). With that
(admittedly very unlikely) assumption, this is demonstrated by describing a
polynomially large network of quantum gates that solves the 3SAT problem with
bounded probability in polynomial time. As in a previous paper by Abrams and
Lloyd (but by a somewhat simpler argument), allowing nonlinearity in the laws
of Quantum Mechanics would prove the "weak Church-Turing thesis" to be false.
General Relativity is suggested as a possible mechanism to supply the necessary
nonlinearity.
