Stability of Three- and Four-Body Coulomb Systems
We discuss the stability of three- and four-particle system interacting by
pure Coulomb interactions, as a function of the masses and charges of the
particles. We present a certain number of general properties which allow to
answer a certain number of questions without or with less numerical
calculations.
