Angular momentum and energy structure of the coherent state of a 2D
  isotropic harmonic oscillator
The angular momentum structure and energy structure of the coherent state of
a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator were investigated. Calculations showed that
the average values of angular momentum and energy (except the zero point
energy) of this nonspreading 2D wave packet are identical to those of the
corresponding classical oscillator moving along a circular or an elliptic
orbit.
