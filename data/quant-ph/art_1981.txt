Thoughts on Commutation Relations and Measurement Accuracy
We show that measuring the trajectories of charged particles to finite
accuracy leads to the commutation relations needed for the derivation of the
free space Maxwell equations using the {\it discrete ordered calculus} (DOC).
We note that the finite step length derivation of the discrete difference
version of the single particle Dirac equation implies the discrete version of
the p,q commutation relations for a free particle. We speculate that a careful
operational analysis of the change in momenta occurring in a step-wise
continuous solution of the discrete Dirac equation could supply the missing
source-sink terms in the DOC derivation of the Maxwell equations, and lead to a
finite and discrete (``renormalized'') quantum electrodynamics (QED).
