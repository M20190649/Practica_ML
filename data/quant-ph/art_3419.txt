Comment on "Experimental realization of Popper's experiment: Violation
  of the uncertainty principle?"
Application of the uncertainty principle to conditional measurements is
investigated, and found to be valid for measurements on separated sub-systems.
In light of this, an apparent violation of the uncertainty principle obtained
by Kim and Shih in their realization of Popper's experiment (quant-ph/9905039)
is explained through analogy with a simple optical system.
