Non locality, closing the detection loophole and communication
  complexity
It is shown that the detection loophole which arises when trying to rule out
local realistic theories as alternatives for quantum mechanics can be closed if
the detection efficiency $\eta$ is larger than $\eta \geq d^{1/2} 2^{-0.0035d}$
where $d$ is the dimension of the entangled system. Furthermore it is argued
that this exponential decrease of the detector efficiency required to close the
detection loophole is almost optimal. This argument is based on a close
connection that exists between closing the detection loophole and the amount of
classical communication required to simulate quantum correlation when the
detectors are perfect.
