Structure of the Algebra of Effective Observables in Quantum Mechanics
A subclass of dynamical semigroups induced by the interaction of a quantum
system with an environment is introduced. Such semigroups lead to the selection
of a stable subalgebra of effective observables. The structure of this
subalgebra is completely determined.
