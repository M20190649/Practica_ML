Two - Level Atom - Field Interaction: Exact Master Equations for
  Non-Markovian Dynamics, Decoherence and Relaxation
We perform a first- principles derivation of the general master equation to
study the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level atom (2LA) interacting with an
electromagnetic field (EMF). We use the influence functional method which can
incorporate the full backreaction of the field on the atom, while adopting
Grassmannian variables for the 2LA and the coherent state representation for
the EMF. We find exact master equations for the cases of a free quantum field
and a cavity field in the vacuum. In response to the search for mechanisms to
preserve maximal coherence in quantum computations in ion trap prototypes, we
apply these equations to analyse the decoherence of a 2LA in an EMF, and fine
that decoherence time is close to relaxation time. This is at variance to the
claims by authors who studied the same system but used a different coupling
model. We explain the source of difference and argue that, contrary to common
belief, the EMF when resonantly coupled to an atom does not decohere it as
efficiently as a bath does on a quantum Brownian particle. The master-equations
for non-Markovian dynamics derived here is expected to be useful for exploring
new regimes of 2LA-EMF interaction, which is becoming physically important
experimentally.
