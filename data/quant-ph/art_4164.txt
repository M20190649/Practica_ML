Time Interval Operators
In this work we will advance farther along a line previously developed
concerning our proposal of a time interval operator, on finite dimensional
spaces. The time interval operator is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are time
values with a precise and interesting role on the dynamics. With the help of
the Discrete Phase Space Formalism (DPSF) previously developed, we show that
the time interval operator is the complementary pair of the Hamiltonian. From
that, a simple system is proposed as a quantum clock. The only restriction is
that our results do not apply to all possible Hamiltonians.
