Hadamard Products of Product Operators and the Design of
  Gradient-Diffusion Experiments for Simulating Decoherence by NMR Spectroscopy
An extension of the product operator formalism of NMR is introduced, which
uses the Hadamard matrix product to describe many simple spin 1/2 relaxation
processes. The utility of this formalism is illustrated by deriving NMR
gradient-diffusion experiments to simulate several decoherence models of
interest in quantum information processing, along with their Lindblad and Kraus
representations. Gradient-diffusion experiments are also described for several
more complex forms of decoherence, including the well-known collective
isotropic model. Finally, it is shown that the Hadamard formalism gives a
concise representation of decoherence with arbitrary correlations among the
fluctuating fields at the different spins involved, and that this can be
applied to both decoherence (T2) as well as nonadiabatic relaxation (T1)
processes.
