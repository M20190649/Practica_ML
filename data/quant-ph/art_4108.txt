Intrinsic decoherence in atomic diffraction by standing light wave
We study the effects of time uncertainty in the interaction of atoms with a
standing light wave. We discuss its physical origin and the possibility to
observe intrinsic decoherence effects by measuring the atomic momentum
distribution.
