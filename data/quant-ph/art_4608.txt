Everett and Structure
I address the problem of indefiniteness in quantum mechanics: the problem
that the theory, without changes to its formalism, seems to predict that
macroscopic quantities have no definite values. The Everett interpretation is
often criticised along these lines and I shall argue that much of this
criticism rests on a false dichotomy: that the macroworld must either be
written directly into the formalism or be regarded as somehow illusory. By
means of analogy with other areas of physics, I develop the view that the
macroworld is instead to be understood in terms of certain structures and
patterns which emerge from quantum theory (given appropriate dynamics, in
particular decoherence). I extend this view to the observer, and in doing so
make contact with functionalist theories of mind.
