Theory of the Quantum Speed Up
Insofar as quantum computation is faster than classical, it appears to be
irreversible. In all quantum algorithms found so far the speed-up depends on
the extra-dynamical irreversible projection representing quantum measurement.
Quantum measurement performs a computation that dynamical computation cannot
accomplish as efficiently.
