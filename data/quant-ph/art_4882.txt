Quantum cloning of orthogonal qubits
An optimal universal cloning transformation is derived that produces M copies
of an unknown qubit from a pair of orthogonal qubits. For M>6, the
corresponding cloning fidelity is higher than that of the optimal copying of a
pair of identical qubits. It is shown that this cloning transformation can be
implemented probabilistically via parametric down-conversion by feeding the
signal and idler modes of a nonlinear crystal with orthogonally polarized
photons.
