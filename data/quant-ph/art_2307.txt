Attention, Intention, and Will in Quantum Physics
The need for a self-observing quantum system to pose questions leads to a
tripartite quantum process involving a Schroedinger process that is local
deterministic, a Heisenberg process that poses the question, and a Dirac
process that picks the answer. In the classical limit where Planck's constant
is set to zero these three processes reduce to one single deterministic
classical process: the fine structure wherein lies the effect of mind upon
matter is obliterated.
