Complete quantum teleportation with a Kerr nonlinearity
We present a scheme for the quantum teleportation of the polarization state
of a photon employing a cross-Kerr medium. The experimental feasibility of the
scheme is discussed and we show that, using the recently demonstrated ultraslow
light propagation in cold atomic media, our proposal can be realized with
presently available technology.
