Quantum error correction in the presence of spontaneous emission
We present a quantum error correcting code that is invariant under the
conditional time evolution between spontaneous emissions and which can correct
for one general error. The code presented here generalizes previous error
correction codes in that not all errors lead to different error syndromes. This
idea may lead to shorter codes than previously expected.
