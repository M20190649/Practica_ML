Quantum Computation and the localization of Modular Functors
The mathematical problem of localizing modular functors to neighborhoods of
points is shown to be closely related to the physical problem of engineering a
local Hamiltonian for a computationally universal quantum medium. For genus
$=0$ surfaces, such a local Hamiltonian is mathematically defined. Braiding
defects of this medium implements a representation associated to the Jones
polynomial and this representation is known to be universal for quantum
computation.
