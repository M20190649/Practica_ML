Are there basic laws of quantum information processing?
We prove within the standard quantum formalism without reduction postulate
that the no-cloning theorem and the principle of no-increasing of entanglement
under local actions and one-way classical communication are equivalent. We
argue that the result is a manifestation of more general principles governing
quantum information processing analogous to the thermodynamical laws.
