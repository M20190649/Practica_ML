Photon states associated with Holstein-Primakoff realization of SU(1,1)
  Lie algebra
Statistical and phase properties and number-phase uncertainty relations are
systematically investigated for photon states associated with the
Holstein-Primakoff realization of the SU(1,1) Lie algebra. Perelomov's SU(1,1)
coherent states and the eigenstates of the SU(1,1) lowering generator (the
Barut-Girardello states) are discussed. A recently developed formalism, based
on the antinormal ordering of exponential phase operators, is used for studying
phase properties and number-phase uncertainty relations. This study shows
essential differences between properties of the Barut-Girardello states and the
SU(1,1) coherent states. The philophase states, defined as states with simple
phase-state representations, relate the quantum description of the optical
phase to the properties of the SU(1,1) Lie group. A modified Holstein-Primakoff
realization is derived, and eigenstates of the corresponding lowering generator
are discussed. These states are shown to contract, in a proper limit, to the
familiar Glauber coherent states.
