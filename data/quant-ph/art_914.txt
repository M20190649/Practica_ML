Ghost interference and diffraction based on the beam splitter
A simple scheme is proposed for observing the ghost interference and
diffraction. The signal and the idler beams are produced by a beam splitter
with the incident light being in a thermal state. A slit is inserted into the
signal beam. We derive rigorously that interference-diffraction patterns can be
observed in the first-order correlation by scanning the probe in the idler
beam.
