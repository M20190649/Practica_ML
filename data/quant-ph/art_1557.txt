Comment on ``Possibility of quantum mechanics being nonlocal''
A recent proof, formulated in the symbolic language of modal logic, shows
that a well-defined formulation of the possibility mentioned in the title is
answered affirmatively. In the paper being commented upon several proposals
were made about how to translate this symbolic proof into prose, and it was
concluded, on the basis of those proposed translations, that either the proof
was invalid or that an unwarranted reality assumption was made. However, those
interpretations deviate in small but important ways from the precise logical
path followed in the proof. It is explained here how by staying on this path
one avoids the difficulties that those deviations engendered.
