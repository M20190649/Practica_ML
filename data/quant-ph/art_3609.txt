Quantum Algorithms for Element Distinctness
We present several applications of quantum amplitude amplification to finding
claws and collisions in ordered or unordered functions. Our algorithms
generalize those of Brassard, Hoyer, and Tapp, and imply an O(N^{3/4} log N)
quantum upper bound for the element distinctness problem in the comparison
complexity model (contrasting with Theta(N log N) classical complexity). We
also prove a lower bound of Omega(N^{1/2}) comparisons for this problem and
derive bounds for a number of related problems.
