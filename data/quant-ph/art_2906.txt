Some relations between quantum Turing machines and Turing machines
For quantum Turing machines we present three elements: Its components, its
time evolution operator and its local transition function. The components are
related with the components of deterministic Turing machines, the time
evolution operator is related with the evolution of reversible Turing machines
and the local transition function is related with the transition function of
probabilistic and reversible Turing machines.
