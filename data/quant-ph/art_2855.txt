Reconstruction of the spin state
System of 1/2 spin particles is observed repeatedly using Stern-Gerlach
apparatuses with rotated orientations. Synthesis of such non-commuting
observables is analyzed using maximum likelihood estimation as an example of
quantum state reconstruction. Repeated incompatible observations represent a
new generalized measurement. This idealized scheme will serve for analysis of
future experiments in neutron and quantum optics.
