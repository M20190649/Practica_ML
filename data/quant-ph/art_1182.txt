A diakoptic approach to quantum computation
In the diakoptic approach, mechanisms are divided into simpler parts
interconnected in some standard way (say by a "mechanical connection''). We
explore the possibility of applying this approach to quantum mechanisms: the
specialties of the quantum domain seem to yield a richer result. First parts
are made independent of each other by assuming that connections are removed.
The overall state would thus become a superposition of tensor products of the
eigenstates of the independent parts. Connections are restored by projecting
off all the tensor products which violate them. This would be performed by
particle statistics, under a special interpretation thereof. The NP-complete
problem of testing the satisfiability of a Boolean network is approached in
this way. The diakoptic approach appears to be able of taming the quantum whole
without clipping its richness.
