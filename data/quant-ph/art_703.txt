On the Quantum Space-Time Coordinates of an Event
This paper gives a representation of the most general positive operator
valued measure in Minkowski space-time, covariant with respect to the Poincare'
group. It provides the correct mathematical description of the space-time
coordinates of a quantum event, described by a quantum object with suitable
properties. It is known that these coordinates cannot be represented by
self-adjoint operators or by the corresponding projection valued measure.
