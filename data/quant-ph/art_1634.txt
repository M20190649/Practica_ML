Bound Entanglement and Teleportation
Recently M. Horodecki, P. Horodecki and R. Horodecki have introduced a set of
density matrices of two spin-1 particles from which it is not possible to
distill any maximally entangled states, even though the density matrices are
entangled. Thus these density matrices do not allow reliable teleportation.
However it might nevertheless be the case that these states can be used for
teleportation, not reliably, but still with fidelity greater than that which
may be achieved with a classical scheme. We show that, at least for some of
these density matrices, teleportation cannot be achieved with better than
classical fidelity.
