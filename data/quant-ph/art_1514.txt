Semiclassical trajectory-coherent approximation in quantum mechanics:
  II. High order corrections to the Dirac operators in external electromagnetic
  field
High approximations of semiclassical trajectory-coherent states (TCS) and of
semiclassical Green function (in the class of semiclassically concentrated
states) for the Dirac operator with anomalous Pauli interaction are obtained.
For Schrodinger and Dirac operators trajectory-coherent representations are
constructed up to any precision with respect to h, h-->0.
