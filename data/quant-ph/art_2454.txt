Quantum Probability from Decision Theory?
Deutsch has recently (in quant-ph/9906015) offered a justification, based
only on the non-probabilistic axioms of quantum theory and of classical
decision theory, for the use of the standard quantum probability rules. In this
note, this justification is examined.
