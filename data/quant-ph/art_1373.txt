Optimal compression of quantum information for one-qubit source at
  incomplete data: a new aspect of Jaynes principle
We consider the problem of optimal processing of quantum information at
incomplete experimental data characterizing the quantum source. In particular,
we then prove that for one-qubit quantum source the Jaynes principle offers a
simple scheme for optimal compression of quantum information. According to the
scheme one should process as if the density matrix of the source were actually
equal to the matrix of the Jaynes state.
