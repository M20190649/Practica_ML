Some Notes on Parallel Quantum Computation
We exhibit some simple gadgets useful in designing shallow parallel circuits
for quantum algorithms. We prove that any quantum circuit composed entirely of
controlled-not gates or of diagonal gates can be parallelized to logarithmic
depth, while circuits composed of both cannot. Finally, while we note the
Quantum Fourier Transform can be parallelized to linear depth, we exhibit a
simple quantum circuit related to it that we believe cannot be parallelized to
less than linear depth, and therefore might be used to prove that QNC < QP.
