About Zitterbewegung and electron structure
We start from the spinning electron theory by Barut and Zanghi, which has
been recently translated into the Clifford algebra language. We "complete" such
a translation, first of all, by expressing in the Clifford formalism a
particular Barut-Zanghi (BZ) solution, which refers (at the classical limit) to
an internal helical motion with a time-like speed [and is here shown to
originate from the superposition of positive and negative frequency solutions
of the Dirac equation]. Then, we show how to construct solutions of the Dirac
equation describing helical motions with light-like speed, which meet very well
the standard interpretation of the velocity operator in the Dirac equation
theory (and agree with the solution proposed by Hestenes, on the basis
--however-- of ad-hoc assumptions that are unnecessary in the present
approach). The above results appear to support the conjecture that the
Zitterbewegung motion (a helical motion, at the classical limit) is responsible
for the electron spin.
