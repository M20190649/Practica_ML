Separability and the stella octangula
A geometrical picture of separability of 2 x 2 composite quantum systems,
showing the region of separable density matrices in the space of hermitian
matrices, is given. It rests on the criterion of separability given by Peres,
and it is an extension of the ``Horodecki diagram'' and the ``stella
octangula'' described by Aravind.
