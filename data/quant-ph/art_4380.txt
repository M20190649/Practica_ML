Secrecy, Computational Loads and Rates in Practical Quantum Cryptography
A number of questions associated with practical implementations of quantum
cryptography systems having to do with unconditional secrecy, computational
loads and effective secrecy rates in the presence of perfect and imperfect
sources are discussed. The different types of unconditional secrecy, and their
relationship to general communications security, are discussed in the context
of quantum cryptography. In order to actually carry out a quantum cryptography
protocol it is necessary that sufficient computational resources be available
to perform the various processing steps, such as sifting, error correction,
privacy amplification and authentication. We display the full computer machine
instruction requirements needed to support a practical quantum cryptography
implementation. We carry out a numerical comparison of system performance
characteristics for implementations that make use of either weak coherent
sources of light or perfect single photon sources, for eavesdroppers making
individual attacks on the quantum channel characterized by different levels of
technological capability. We find that, while in some circumstances it is best
to employ perfect single photon sources, in other situations it is preferable
to utilize weak coherent sources. In either case the secrecy level of the final
shared cipher is identical, with the relevant distinguishing figure-of-merit
being the effective throughput rate.
