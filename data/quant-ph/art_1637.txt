Pulse controlled noise suppressed quantum computation
To make arbitrarily accurate quantum computation possible, practical
realization of quantum computers will require suppressing noise in quantum
memory and gate operations to make it below a threshold value. A scheme based
on realistic quantum computer models is described for suppressing noise in
quantum computation without the cost of stringent quantum computing resources.
