Local Transition Functions of Quantum Turing Machines
Foundations of the notion of quantum Turing machines are investigated.
According to Deutsch's formulation, the time evolution of a quantum Turing
machine is to be determined by the local transition function. In this paper,
the local transition functions are characterized for fully general quantum
Turing machines, including multi-tape quantum Turing machines, extending the
results due to Bernstein and Vazirani.
