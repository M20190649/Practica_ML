In (quant-ph/9911099 version 1) A. Moroz claims that the exponent $\eta$ from
the local photon density of states near a band gap edge $\rho(\omega) =
K(\vec{r}) |\omega_c - \omega|^\eta$ varies strongly with the position in the
crystal. We show that this is not the case and we demonstrate the error in his
analysis.
