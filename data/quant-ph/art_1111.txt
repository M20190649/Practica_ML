Quantum self-dual codes and symmetric matrices
This paper has been withdrawn since a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for general
quantum codes has already appeared in Ekert and Macchiavello, Prys. Rev. Lett.
77, p. 2585, and a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for stabilizer codes connected with
orthogonal geometry, or equivalently, with symmetric matrices as in this paper,
has been proved by Calredbank, Rains, Shor and Sloane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, p.
405. I would like to thank Robert Calderbank for pointing out these references
to me.
