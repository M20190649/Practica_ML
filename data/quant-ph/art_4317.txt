A Measure of Stregth of an Unextendible Product Basis
A notion of strength of an unextendible product basis is introduced and a
quantitative measure for it is suggested with a view to providing an indirect
measure for the bound entanglement of formation of the bound entangled mixed
state associated with an unextendible product basis.
