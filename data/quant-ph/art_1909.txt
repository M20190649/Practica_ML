On the Disentanglement of States
Disentanglement is the process which transforms a state $\rho$ of two
subsystems into an unentangled state, while not effecting the reduced density
matrices of each of the two subsystems. Recently Terno showed that an arbitrary
state cannot be disentangled into a tensor product of its reduced density
matrices. In this letter we present various novel results regarding
disentanglement of states. Our main result is that there are sets of states
which cannot be successfuly disentangled (not even into a separable state).
Thus, we prove that a universal disentangling machine cannot exist.
