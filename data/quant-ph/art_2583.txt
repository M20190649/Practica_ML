Ultimate physical limits to computation
Computers are physical systems: what they can and cannot do is dictated by
the laws of physics. In particular, the speed with which a physical device can
process information is limited by its energy and the amount of information that
it can process is limited by the number of degrees of freedom it possesses.
This paper explores the physical limits of computation as determined by the
speed of light $c$, the quantum scale $\hbar$ and the gravitational constant
$G$. As an example, quantitative bounds are put to the computational power of
an `ultimate laptop' with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one
liter.
