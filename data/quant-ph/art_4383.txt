Role of causality in ensuring unconditional security of relativistic
  quantum cryptography
The problem of unconditional security of quantum cryptography (i.e. the
security which is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of nature rather than by
technical limitations) is one of the central points in quantum information
theory. We propose a relativistic quantum cryptosystem and prove its
unconditional security against any eavesdropping attempts. Relativistic
causality arguments allow to demonstrate the security of the system in a simple
way. Since the proposed protocol does not employ collective measurements and
quantum codes, the cryptosystem can be experimentally realized with the present
state-of-art in fiber optics technologies. The proposed cryptosystem employs
only the individual measurements and classical codes and, in addition, the key
distribution problem allows to postpone the choice of the state encoding scheme
until after the states are already received instead of choosing it before
sending the states into the communication channel (i.e. to employ a sort of
``antedate'' coding).
