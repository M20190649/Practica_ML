The Quantum Tomographic Roulette Wheel
Random-phase homodyne tomography of the field intensity is a concrete example
of the Quantum Roulette of Helstrom. In this paper we give the explicit POM of
such measurement and compare it with direct photodetection and heterodyne
detection. Effects of nonunit quantum efficiency are also considered. Naimark
extensions for the roulette POM are analyzed and its experimental realization
is discussed.
