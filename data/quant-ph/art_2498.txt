Mutual coherence of optical and matter waves
We propose a scheme to measure the cross-correlations and mutual coherence of
optical and matter fields. It relies on the combination of a matter-wave
detector operating by photoionization of the atoms and a traditional absorption
photodetector. We show that the double-detection signal is sensitive to
cross-correlation functions of light and matter waves.
