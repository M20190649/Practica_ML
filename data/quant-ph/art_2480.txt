Three Approaches to the Quantitative Definition of Information in an
  Individual Pure Quantum State
In analogy of classical Kolmogorov complexity we develop a theory of the
algorithmic information in bits contained in any one of continuously many pure
quantum states: quantum Kolmogorov complexity. Classical Kolmogorov complexity
coincides with the new quantum Kolmogorov complexity restricted to the
classical domain. Quantum Kolmogorov complexity is upper bounded and can be
effectively approximated from above. With high probability a quantum object is
incompressible. There are two alternative approaches possible: to define the
complexity as the length of the shortest qubit program that effectively
describes the object, and to use classical descriptions with computable real
parameters.
