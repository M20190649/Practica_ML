The Faraday Quantum Clock and Non-local Photon Pair Correlations
We study the use of the Faraday effect as a quantum clock for measuring
traversal times of evanescent photons through magneto-refractive structures.
The Faraday effect acts both as a phase-shifter and as a filter for circular
polarizations. Only measurements based on the Faraday phase-shift properties
are relevant to the traversal time measurements. The Faraday polarization
filtering may cause the loss of non-local (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) two-photon
correlations, but this loss can be avoided without sacrificing the clock
accuracy. We show that a mechanism of destructive interference between
consecutive paths is responsible for superluminal traversal times measured by
the clock.
