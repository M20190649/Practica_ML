Bell-inequality violation with "thermal" radiation
The model of a quantum-optical device for a conditional preparation of
entangled states from input mixed states is presented. It is demonstrated that
even thermal or pseudo-thermal radiation can be entangled in such a way, that
Bell-inequalities are violated.
