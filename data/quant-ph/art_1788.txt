Quantum superpositions and definite perceptions:envisaging new feasible
  experimental tests
We call attention on the fact that recent unprecedented technological
achievements, in particular in the field of quantum optics, seem to open the
way to new experimental tests which might be relevant both for the foundational
problems of quantum mechanics as well as for investigating the perceptual
processes.
