The Influence of Superpositional Wave Function Oscillations on Shor's
  Quantum Algorithm
We investigate the influence of superpositional wave function oscillations on
the performance of Shor's quantum algorithm for factorization of integers. It
is shown that the wave function oscillations can destroy the required quantum
interference. This undesirable effect can be routinely eliminated using a
resonant pulse implementation of quantum computation, but requires special
analysis for non-resonant implementations.
