Revivals of Quantum Wave Packets
We present a generic treatment of wave-packet revivals for quantum-mechanical
systems. This treatment permits a classification of certain ideal revival
types. For example, wave packets for a particle in a one-dimensional box are
shown to exhibit perfect revivals. We also examine the revival structure of
wave packets for quantum systems with energies that depend on two quantum
numbers. Wave packets in these systems exhibit quantum beats in the initial
motion as well as new types of long-term revivals. As an example, we consider
the revival structure of a particle in a two-dimensional box.
