A Collection of Probabilistic Hidden-Variable Theorems and
  Counterexamples
The purpose of this article is to formulate a number of probabilistic
hidden-variable theorems, to provide proofs in some cases, and counterexamples
to some conjectured relationships. The first theorem is the fundamental one. It
asserts the general equivalence of the existence of a hidden variable and the
existence of a joint probability distribution of the observed quatities,
whether finite or continuous.
