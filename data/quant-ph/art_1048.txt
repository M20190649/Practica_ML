Is Quantum Mechaincs Non-Local?
Stapp has recently argued from a version of the Hardy type experiments that
quantum mechanics must be non-local, independent of any additional assumptions
like realism or hidden variables. I argue that either his conclusions do not
follow from his assumptions, or that his assumptions are not true of quantum
mechanics and can be interpreted as assigning an unwarranted level of reality
to the value of certain quantum attributes.
