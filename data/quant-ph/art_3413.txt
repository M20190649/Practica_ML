Existential Contextuality and the Models of Meyer, Kent and Clifton
It is shown that the models recently proposed by Meyer, Kent and Clifton
(MKC) exhibit a novel kind of contextuality, which we term existential
contextuality. In this phenomenon it is not simply the pre-existing value but
the actual existence of an observable which is context dependent. This result
confirms the point made elsewhere, that the MKC models do not, as the authors
claim, ``nullify'' the Kochen-Specker theorem. It may also be of some
independent interest.
