Remarks on Noncontextual Hidden Variables and Physical Measurements
Kent [quant-ph/9906006] has constructed a hidden variable theory by taking
the finite precision of physical measurements into account. But its claim to
noncontextuality has been queried, and it shown here that there is a
particularly simple way of seeing why it cannot be noncontextual.
