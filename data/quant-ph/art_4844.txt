Multi-Photon Entanglement Concentration and Quantum Cryptography
Multi-photon states from parametric down-conversion can be entangled both in
polarization and photon number. Maximal high-dimensional entanglement can be
concentrated from these states via photon counting. This makes them natural
candidates for quantum key distribution, where the presence of more than one
photon per detection interval has up to now been considered as undesirable. We
propose a simple multi-photon protocol for the case of low losses and point out
the robustness of the entanglement under photon loss.
