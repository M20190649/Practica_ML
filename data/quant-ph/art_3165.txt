Motional sidebands and direct measurement of the cooling rate in the
  resonance fluorescence of a single trapped ion
Resonance fluorescence of a single trapped ion is spectrally analyzed using a
heterodyne technique. Motional sidebands due to the oscillation of the ion in
the harmonic trap potential are observed in the fluorescence spectrum. From the
width of the sidebands the cooling rate is obtained and found to be in
agreement with the theoretical prediction.
