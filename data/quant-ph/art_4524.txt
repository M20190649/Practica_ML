Is quantum decoherence reality or appearance?
It has been experimentally demonstrated that quantum coherence can persist in
macroscopic phenomena [J.R. Friedman et al.,Nature, 406 (2000) 43]. To face the
challenge of this new fact, in this article QM in its standard form is assumed
to be extended by one beable (hidden variable), i. e., a quantum observable
with always definite values in nature (but usually only statistically given in
the quantum state). Localization is taken as the most plausible beable. The
paradoxical aspects of conventional QM take now a different form. Suitably
defining the notion of "subject" fully within the QM formalism, proving the
quantum conditional subsystem-state theorem, and choosing the
relative-decoherence interpretation of QM, the paradoxes formally disappear,
leaving one with decoherence relative to the definite values of the beable;
thus being only appearance, not absolute reality in QM. Relative to a different
subject one has perseverance of coherence. Hence, in this approach it is
claimed that decoherence and coherence, both exist in reality, but are not
"seen" by the same subject, and "subject" is, in this interpretation,
indispensable. The two mentioned, apparently contradictory phenomena, are in
this way decoupled from each other, contradiction is avoided, and any one of
the two can be treated in the way that is usual in QM.
