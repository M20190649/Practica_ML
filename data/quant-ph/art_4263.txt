Quantum mutual entropy for two-level ion in a q-analog trap
Quantum mutual entropy is used as a measure of information content of ionic
state due to ion-laser interaction in a q-analog trap. The initial state of the
system is a Schrodinger cat state. It is found that the partial mutual entropy
is a good measure of the entanglement and purity of the ionic state at $t>0$.
