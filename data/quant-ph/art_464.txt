Conditional generation of error syndromes in fault-tolerant error
  correction
In this paper we show how the fault--tolerant error correction scheme
recently proposed by DiVincenzo and Shor may be improved. Our scheme, unlike
the earlier one, can also deal with a single error that might occur {\em
during} the gate operations that are required for the implementation of the
error correction and not only in--between the gates and hence presents an
improvement towards enabling error correction and with it the practical
possibility of some more involved quantum computations, such as e.g.
factorization of large numbers.
