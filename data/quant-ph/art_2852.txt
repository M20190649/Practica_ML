Semiclassical limit of the Dirac equation and spin precession
We study the Dirac equation with slowly varying external potentials. Using
matrix-valued Wigner functions we prove that the electron follows with high
precision the classical orbit and that the spin precesses according to the BMT
equation with gyromagnetic ratio g=2.
