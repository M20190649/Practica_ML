Effect of classically forbidden momenta in one dimensional quantum
  scattering
The transmitted wave that results from a collision of a wave packet which is
initially to the left of a potential barrier depends in general on the
amplitudes of negative momenta of the initial state. The exact form of this
dependence is shown and the importance of this classically forbidden effect is
illustrated with numerical examples. Special care is taken to account properly
for bound states.
