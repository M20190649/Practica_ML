Characterizing GHZ Correlations in Nondegenerate Parametric Oscillation
  via Phase Measurements
We present a potential realization of the Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger
ALL or NOTHING contradiction of quantum mechanics with local realism using
phase measurement techniques in a simple photon number triplet. Such a triplet
could be generated using nondegenerate parametric oscillation.
