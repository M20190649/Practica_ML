Comment on "Quantum Phase Shift Caused by Spatial Confinement", by B.E.
  Allman et al
The analysis of phase shifts in executed and proposed interferometry
experiments on photons and neutrons neglected forces exerted at the boundaries
of spatial constrictions. When those forces are included it is seen that the
observed phenomena are not in fact geometric in nature. A new proposal to be
published by Allman et al. avoids that pitfall.
