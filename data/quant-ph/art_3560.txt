Decoherence and Entanglement in Two-mode Squeezed Vacuum States
I investigate the decoherence of two-mode squeezed vacuum states by analyzing
the relative entropy of entanglement. I consider two sources of decoherence:
(i) the phase damping and (ii) the amplitude damping due to the coupling to the
thermal environment. In particular, I give the exact value of the relative
entropy of entanglement for the phase damping model. For the amplitude damping
model, I give an upper bound for the relative entropy of entanglement, which
turns out to be a good approximation for the entanglement measure in usual
experimental situations.
