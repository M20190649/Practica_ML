Quantum Entangled States and Quasiclassical Dynamics in Macroscopic Spin
  Systems
When dealing with macroscopic objects one usually observes quasiclassical
phenomena, which can be described in terms of quasiclassical (or classical)
equations of motion. Recent development of the theory of quantum computation is
based on implementation of the entangled states which do not have a classical
analogy. Using a simple example of a paramagnetic spin system we show that the
entangled states can be detected in standard macroscopic experiments as a sharp
deviation from quasiclassical motion.
