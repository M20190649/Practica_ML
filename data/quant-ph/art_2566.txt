Nonclassical interaction-free detection of objects in a monolithic
  total-internal-reflection resonator
We show that with an efficiency exceeding 99% one can use a monolithic
total-internal-reflection resonator in order to ascertain the presence of an
object without transferring a quantum of energy to it. We also propose an
experiment on the probabilistic meaning of the electric field that contains
only a very few photons.
