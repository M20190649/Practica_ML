Squeezing spectra of the output field by high density exciton laser
The effect of the non-linear interaction between the high density Wannier
excitons is analysed. We use the Fokker-Planck equation in the positive P
presentation and the corresponding stochastic differential equation to study
the composite system of a single mode cavity field and exciton under classical
field pumping. The small fluctuation approximation is made to get the
quadrature squeezing spectra of the output light field. The conditions for the
squeezing of the either quadrature component of the output light are given.
