Numerical simulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments in a local
  hidden variables model
We simulate correlation measurements of entangled photons numerically. The
model employed is strictly local. In our model correlations arise from a phase,
connecting the electromagnetic fields of the two photons at their separate
points of measurement. We sum up coincidences for each pair individually and
model the operation of a polarizer beam splitter numerically. The results thus
obtained differ substantially from the classical results. In addition, we
analyze the effects of decoherence and non-ideal beam splitters. It is shown
that under realistic experimental conditions the Bell inequalities are violated
by more than 30 standard deviations.
