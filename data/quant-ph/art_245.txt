Minimum-Uncertainty Angular Wave Packets and Quantized Mean Values
Uncertainty relations between a bounded coordinate operator and a conjugate
momentum operator frequently appear in quantum mechanics. We prove that
physically reasonable minimum-uncertainty solutions to such relations have
quantized expectation values of the conjugate momentum. This implies, for
example, that the mean angular momentum is quantized for any
minimum-uncertainty state obtained from any uncertainty relation involving the
angular-momentum operator and a conjugate coordinate. Experiments specifically
seeking to create minimum-uncertainty states localized in angular coordinates
therefore must produce packets with integer angular momentum.
