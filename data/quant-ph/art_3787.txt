Comment on: "A quantum approach to static games of complete
  information''
Recently Marinatto and Weber introduced an interesting new scheme for
quantizing games, and applied their scheme to the famous game 'Battle of the
Sexes'. In this Comment we make two observations: (a) the overall quantization
scheme is fundamentally very similar to a previous scheme proposed by Eisert et
al., and (b) in contrast to a main claim of the paper, the quantum Battle of
the Sexes game does not have a unique solution - a similar dilemma exists in
both the classical and the quantum versions.
