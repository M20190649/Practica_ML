A Survey on Bohmian Mechanics
Bohmian mechanics is the most naively obvious embedding imaginable of
Schr\"odinger's equation into a completely coherent physical theory. It
describes a world in which particles move in a highly non-Newtonian sort of
way, one which may at first appear to have little to do with the spectrum of
predictions of quantum mechanics. It turns out, however, that as a consequence
of the defining dynamical equations of Bohmian mechanics, when a system has
wave function $\psi$ its configuration is typically random, with probability
density $\rho$ given by $|\psi|^2$, the quantum equilibrium distribution. It
also turns out that the entire quantum formalism, operators as observables and
all the rest, is a consequence of Bohmian mechanics.
