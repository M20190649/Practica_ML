Spatial correlations in hexagons generated via a Kerr nonlinearity
We consider the hexagonal pattern forming in the cross-section of an optical
beam produced by a Kerr cavity, and we study the quantum correlations
characterizing this structure. By using arguments related to the symmetry
broken by the pattern formation, we identify a complete scenario of six-mode
entanglement. Five independent phase quadratures combinations, connecting the
hexagonal modes, are shown to exhibit sub-shot-noise fluctuations. By means of
a non-linear quantum calculation technique, quantum correlations among the mode
photon numbers are demonstrated and calculated.
