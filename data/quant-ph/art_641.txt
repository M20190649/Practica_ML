Bounds on Decoherence and Error
When a confined system interacts with its walls (treated quantum
mechanically), there is an intertwining of degrees of freedom. We show that
this need not lead to entanglement, hence decoherence. It will generally lead
to error. The wave function optimization required to avoid decoherence is also
examined.
