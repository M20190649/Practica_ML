Purifying two-bit quantum gates and joint measurements in cavity QED
Using a cavity QED setup we show how to implement a particular joint
measurement on two atoms in a fault tolerant way. Based on this scheme, we
illustrate how to realize quantum communication over a noisy channel when local
operations are subject to errors. We also present a scheme to perform and
purify a universal two-bit gate.
