Robustness of adiabatic quantum computation
We study the fault tolerance of quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, a
quantum algorithm for solving various combinatorial search problems. We
describe an inherent robustness of adiabatic computation against two kinds of
errors, unitary control errors and decoherence, and we study this robustness
using numerical simulations of the algorithm.
