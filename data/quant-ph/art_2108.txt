Characterizing teleportation in optics
We discuss the characterization of continuous variable, optical quantum
teleportation in terms of the two quadrature signal transfer and conditional
variances between the input and output states. We derive criteria which clearly
define the classical limits and highlight interesting operating points which
are not obvious from a calculation of the fidelity of the teleportation alone.
