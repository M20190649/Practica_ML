Maximal entanglement of nonorthogonal states: classification
A necessary and sufficient condition for the maximal entanglement of
bipartite nonorthogonal pure states is found. The condition is applied to the
maximal entanglement of coherent states. Some new classes of maximally
entangled coherent states are explicited constructed; their limits give rise to
maximally entangled Bell-like states.
