Quantization of electromagnetic fields in a circular cylindrical cavity
We present a quantization procedure for the electromagnetic field in a
circular cylindrical cavity with perfectly conducting walls, which is based on
the decomposition of the field. A new decomposition procedure is proposed; all
vector mode functions satisfying the boundary conditions are obtained with the
help of this decomposition. After expanding the quantized field in terms of the
vector mode functions, it is possible to derive the Hamiltonian for this
quantized system.
