Universal Algorithm for Optimal Estimation of Quantum States from Finite
  Ensembles
We present a universal algorithm for the optimal quantum state estimation of
an arbitrary finite dimensional system. The algorithm specifies a physically
realizable positive operator valued measurement (POVM) on a finite number of
identically prepared systems. We illustrate the general formalism by applying
it to different scenarios of the state estimation of N independent and
identically prepared two-level systems (qubits).
