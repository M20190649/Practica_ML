Quantum simulations of optical systems
We show how two level atoms can be used to build microscopic models for
mirrors and beamsplitters. The mirrors can have arbitrary shape allowing closed
cavities to be built. It is possible to build networks or mirrors and
beamsplitters and follow the time-evolution of the intensity of the radiation
through the system.
