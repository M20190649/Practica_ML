Relativistic corrections to the energy spectra of completely confined
  particles
An analytical expression for the relativistic corrections to the energy
spectra of particles completely confined in an one-dimensional limited length
in real space is given, based upon the wave property of particles, the
relativistic energy-momentum relation and two mathematical equations.
