Generalized quantum measurement
We overcome one of Bell's objections to `quantum measurement' by generalizing
the definition to include systems outside the laboratory. According to this
definition a {\sl generalized quantum measurement} takes place when the value
of a classical variable is influenced significantly by an earlier state of a
quantum system. A generalized quantum measurement can then take place in
equilibrium systems, provided the classical motion is chaotic. This paper deals
with this classical aspect of quantum measurement, assuming that the Heisenberg
cut between the quantum dynamics and the classical dynamics is made at a very
small scale. For simplicity, a gas with collisions is modelled by an `Arnold
gas'.
