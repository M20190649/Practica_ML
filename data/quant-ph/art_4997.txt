Limits to clock synchronization induced by completely dephasing
  communication channels
Clock synchronization procedures are analyzed in the presence of imperfect
communications. In this context we show that there are physical limitations
which prevent one from synchronizing distant clocks when the intervening medium
is completely dephasing, as in the case of a rapidly varying dispersive medium.
