Probabilistic cloning and identification of linearly independent quantum
  states
We construct a probabilistic quantum cloning machine by a general
unitary-reduction operation. With a postselection of the measurement results,
the machine yields faithful copies of the input states. It is shown that the
states secretly chosen from a certain set $\$=\left\{\left| \Psi_1\right>
,\left| \Psi_2\right> ,... ,\left| \Psi_n\right> \right\} $ can be
probabilistically cloned if and only if $% \left| \Psi_1\right>$, $\left|
\Psi_2\right>$, $... ,$ and $\left| \Psi_n\right>$ are linearly-independent. We
derive the best possible cloning efficiencies. Probabilistic cloning has close
connection with the problem of identification of a set of states, which is a
type of $n+1$ outcome measurement on $n$ linearly independent states. The
optimal efficiencies for this type of measurement are obtained.
