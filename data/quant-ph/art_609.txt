Minimal Irreversible Quantum Mechanics
It is demonstrated that, making minimal changes in ordinary quantum
mechanics, a reasonable irreversible quantum mechanics can be obtained. This
theory has a more general spectral decompositions, with eigenvectors
corresponding to unstable states that vanish when $t \to \infty .$ These
''Gamov vectors'' have zero norm, in such a way that the norm and the energy of
the physical states remain constant. The evolution operator has no inverse,
showing that we are really dealing with a time-asymmetric theory. Using
Friedrichs model reasonable physical results are obtained, e. g. : the
remaining of an unstable decaying state reappears, in the continuous spectrum
of the model, with its primitive energy.
