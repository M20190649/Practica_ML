Entanglement of Quantum Evolutions
The notion of entanglement can be naturally extended from quantum-states to
the level of general quantum evolutions. This is achieved by considering
multi-partite unitary transformations as elements of a multi-partite Hilbert
space and then extended to general quantum operations. We show some connection
between this entanglement and the entangling capabilities of the quantum
evolution.
