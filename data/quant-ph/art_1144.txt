Quantum-Mechanical Supersymmetry in Traps
We discuss the application of quantum-mechanical supersymmetry to particle
traps. The supersymmetric-partner wave functions may be used to describe a
valence fermion in a trap system with an isotropic harmonic-oscillator
potential. Interactions with the core are incorporated analytically. The close
similarity of this approach to the application of supersymmetry in atomic
systems is made explicit by means of a radial mapping between the two systems.
