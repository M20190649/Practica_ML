Bohmian mechanics and consistent histories
The interpretations of a particular quantum gedanken experiment provided by
Bohmian mechanics and consistent histories are shown to contradict each other,
both in the absence and in the presence of a measuring device. The consistent
history result seems closer to standard quantum mechanics, and shows no
evidence of the mysterious nonlocal influences present in the Bohmian
description.
