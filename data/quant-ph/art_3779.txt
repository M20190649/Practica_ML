Dynamics of quantum entanglement
A model of discrete dynamics of entanglement of bipartite quantum state is
considered. It involves a global unitary dynamics of the system and periodic
actions of local bistochastic or decaying channel. For initially pure states
the decay of entanglement is accompanied with an increase of von Neumann
entropy of the system. We observe and discuss revivals of entanglement due to
unitary interaction of both subsystems. For some mixed states having different
marginal entropies of both subsystems (one of them larger than the global
entropy and the other one one smaller) we find an asymmetry in speed of
entanglement decay. The entanglement of these states decreases faster, if the
depolarizing channel acts on the "classical" subsystem, characterized by
smaller marginal entropy.
