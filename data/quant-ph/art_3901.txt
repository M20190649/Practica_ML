Feynman Clocks, Casual Networks, and the Origin of Hierarchical 'Arrows
  of Time' in Complex Systems from the Big Bang to the Brain
A theory of 'time' as a form of 'information' is proposed. New tools such as
Feynman Clocks, Collective Excitation Networks, Sequential Excitation Networks,
Plateaus of Complexity, and Causal Networks are used to unify previously
separate 'arrows of time'.
