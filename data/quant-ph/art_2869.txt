Deterministic Quantum State Transformations
We derive a necessary condition for the existence of a completely-positive,
linear, trace-preserving map which deterministically transforms one finite set
of pure quantum states into another. This condition is also sufficient for
linearly-independent initial states. We also examine the issue of quantum
coherence, that is, when such operations maintain the purity of superpositions.
If, in any deterministic transformation from one linearly-independent set to
another, even a single, complete superposition of the initial states maintains
its purity, the initial and final states are related by a unitary
transformation.
