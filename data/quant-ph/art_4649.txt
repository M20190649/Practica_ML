Comments on some recently proposed experiments that should distinguish
  Bohmian mechanics from quantum mechanics
Recently Ghose (quant-ph/0001024,quant-ph/0003037,quant-ph/0103126) and
Golshani and Akhavan (quant-ph/0009040,quant-ph/0103100,quant-ph/0103101)
claimed to have found experiments that should be able to distinguish between
Standard Quantum Mechanics and Bohmian Mechanics. It is our aim to show that
the claims made by Ghose, Golshani and Akhavan are unfounded.
