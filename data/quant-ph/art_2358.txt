Quantum Theory of Probability and Decisions
The probabilistic predictions of quantum theory are conventionally obtained
from a special probabilistic axiom. But that is unnecessary because all the
practical consequences of such predictions follow from the remaining,
non-probabilistic, axioms of quantum theory, together with the
non-probabilistic part of classical decision theory.
