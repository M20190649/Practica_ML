Estimates for practical quantum cryptography
In this article I present a protocol for quantum cryptography which is secure
against attacks on individual signals. It is based on the Bennett-Brassard
protocol of 1984 (BB84). The security proof is complete as far as the use of
single photons as signal states is concerned. Emphasis is given to the
practicability of the resulting protocol. For each run of the quantum key
distribution the security statement gives the probability of a successful key
generation and the probability for an eavesdropper's knowledge, measured as
change in Shannon entropy, to be below a specified maximal value.
