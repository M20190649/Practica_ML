Quantum Entanglement and Conditional Information Transmission
We propose a new measure of quantum entanglement. Our measure is defined in
terms of conditional information transmission for a Quantum Bayesian Net. We
show that our measure is identically equal to the Entanglement of Formation in
the case of a bipartite (two listener) system occupying a pure state. In the
case of mixed states, the relationship between these two measures is not known
yet. We discuss some properties of our measure. Our measure can be easily and
naturally generalized to handle n-partite (n-listener) systems. It is
non-negative for any n. It vanishes for conditionally separable states with n
listeners. It is symmetric under permutations of the n listeners. It decreases
if listeners are merged, pruned or removed. Most promising of all, it is
intimately connected with the Data Processing Inequalities. We also find a new
upper bound for classical mutual information which is of interest in its own
right.
