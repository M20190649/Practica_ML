Multilevel Quantum Particle as a Few Virtual Qubits Materialization
A conception of virtual quantum information bit - virtual qubit - is
introduced. It is shown by means of virtual qubit representation that four
states of a single quantum particle is enough for implementation of full set of
the gates, which is necessary for creation an arbitrary algorithm for a quantum
computer. The physical nature and mutual disposition of four working states is
of no significance, if there are suitable selection rules for the particle
interaction with the external electromagnetic field pulses.
