Bohm`s Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and the Reconstruction of the
  Probability Distribution
Within Bohm`s interpretation of quantum mechanics particles follow classical
trajectories that are determined by the full solution of the time dependent
Schroedinger equation. If this interpretation is consistent it must be possible
to determine the probability distribution at time t from the probability
distribution at time t=0 by using these trajectories. In this paper it is shown
that this is the case indeed.
