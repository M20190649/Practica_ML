A new approximation scheme in quantum mechanics
An approximation method which combines the perturbation theory with the
variational calculation is constructed for quantum mechanical problems. Using
the anharmonic oscillator and the He atom as examples, we show that the present
method provides an efficient scheme in estimating both the ground and the
excited states. We also discuss the limitations of the present method.
