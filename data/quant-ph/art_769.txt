Demonstration of the quantum mechanics applicability limits in time
  reversion experiments in spin macrosystems
An experimental study of the applicability of mechanics equations to
describing the process of equilibrium establishing in an isolated spin system
was performed. The time-reversion effects were used at the experiments. It was
demonstrated, that the equations of mechanics do not describe the spin
macrosystem transition to the equilibrium. The experimental results correspond
to the theory which is based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics methods and
takes into account the quick decay of cross-correlations in the systems.
