Bures and Statistical Distance for Squeezed Thermal States
We compute the Bures distance between two thermal squeezed states and deduce
the Statistical Distance metric. By computing the curvature of this metric we
can identify regions of parameter space most sensitive to changes in these
parameters and thus lead to optimum detection statistics.
