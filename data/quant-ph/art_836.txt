Bell inequality and complementarity loophole
A simple classical, deterministic, local situation violating the Bell
inequality is described. The detectors used in the experiment are ideal and the
observers who decide which pair of measuring devices to choose for a given pair
of particles have free will. The construction uses random variables which are
not jointly measurable in a single run of an experiment and the hidden
variables have a nonsymmetric probability density. Such random variables are
complementary but still fully classical. An assumption that classical random
variables cannot satisfy any form of complementarity principle is false, and
this is the loophole used in this example. A relationship to the detector
inefficiency loophole is discussed.
