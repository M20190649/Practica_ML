Experimental limit on the blue shift of the frequency of light implied
  by a q-nonlinearity
We discuss the implications of an experiment in which the frequencies of two
laser beams are compared for different intensities in order to search for a
dependence of the frequency of light on its intensity. Since no such dependence
was found it is possible to place bounds on a description of the
electromagnetic field in terms of q-oscillators. We conclude that the value of
the nonlinearity parameter is smaller than $10^{-17}~$.
