Optimal minimal measurements of mixed states
The optimal and minimal measuring strategy is obtained for a two-state system
prepared in a mixed state with a probability given by any isotropic a priori
distribution. We explicitly construct the specific optimal and minimal
generalized measurements, which turn out to be independent of the a priori
probability distribution, obtaining the best guesses for the unknown state as
well as a closed expression for the maximal mean averaged fidelity. We do this
for up to three copies of the unknown state in a way which leads to the
generalization to any number of copies, which we then present and prove.
