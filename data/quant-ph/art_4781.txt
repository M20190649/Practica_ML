Comment on "Evolution of a Quasi-Stationary State"
Approximately forty years ago it was realized that the time development of
decaying systems might not be precisely exponential. Rolf Winter (Phys. Rev.
{\bf 123}, 1503 (1961)) analyzed the simplest nontrivial system - a particle
tunneling out of a well formed by a wall and a delta-function. He calculated
the probability current just outside the well and found irregular oscillations
on a short time scale followed by an exponential decrease followed by more
oscillations and finally by a decrease as a power of the time. We have
reanalyzed this system, concentrating on the survival probability of the
particle in the well rather than the probability current, and find a different
short time behavior.
