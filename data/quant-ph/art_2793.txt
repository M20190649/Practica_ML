Counting Cold Collisions
We have experimentally explored a novel possibility to study exoergic cold
atomic collisions. Trapping of small countable atom numbers in a shallow
magneto-optical trap and monitoring of their temporal dynamics allows us to
directly observe isolated two-body atomic collisions and provides detailed
information on loss statistics. A substantial fraction of such cold collisional
events has been found to result in the loss of one atom only. We have also
observed for the first time a strong optical suppression of ground-state
hyperfine-changing collisions in the trap by its repump laser field.
