Lorentz-covariant quantum mechanics and preferred frame
In this paper the relativistic quantum mechanics is considered in the
framework of the nonstandard synchronization scheme for clocks. Such a
synchronization preserves Poincar{\'e} covariance but (at least formally)
distinguishes an inertial frame. This enables to avoid the problem of a
noncausal transmision of information related to breaking of the Bell's
inequalities in QM. Our analysis has been focused mainly on the problem of
existence of a proper position operator for massive particles. We have proved
that in our framework such an operator exists for particles with arbitrary
spin. It fulfills all the requirements: it is Hermitean and covariant, it has
commuting components and moreover its eigenvectors (localised states) are also
covariant. We have found the explicit form of the position operator and have
demonstrated that in the preferred frame our operator coincides with the
Newton--Wigner one. We have also defined a covariant spin operator and have
constructed an invariant spin square operator. Moreover, full algebra of
observables consisting of position operators, fourmomentum operators and spin
operators is manifestly Poincar\'e covariant in this framework. Our results
support expectations of other authors (Bell, Eberhard) that a consistent
formulation of quantum mechanics demands existence of a preferred frame.
