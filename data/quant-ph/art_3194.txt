Consistent histories, the quantum Zeno effect, and time of arrival
We present a decomposition of the general quantum mechanical evolution
operator, that corresponds to the path decomposition expansion, and interpret
its constituents in terms of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). This decomposition
is applied to a finite dimensional example and to the case of a free particle
in the real line, where the possibility of boundary conditions more general
than those hitherto considered in the literature is shown. We reinterpret the
assignment of consistent probabilities to different regions of spacetime in
terms of the QZE. The comparison of the approach of consistent histories to the
problem of time of arrival with the solution provided by the probability
distribution of Kijowski shows the strength of the latter point of view.
