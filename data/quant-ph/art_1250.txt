Quantum Fluctuations of Mass for a Mirror in Vacuum
A mirror in vacuum is coupled to fluctuating quantum fields. As a result, its
energy-momentum and mass fluctuate. We compute the correlation spectra of force
and mass fluctuations for a mirror at rest in vacuum (of a scalar field in a
two-dimensional space-time). The obtained expressions agree with a mass
correction equal to a vacuum energy stored by the mirror. We introduce a
Lagrangian model which consistently describes a scalar field coupled to a
scatterer, with inertial mass being a quantum variable.
