Quantum probability distribution of arrival times and probability
  current density
This paper compares the proposal made in previous papers for a quantum
probability distribution of the time of arrival at a certain point with the
corresponding proposal based on the probability current density. Quantitative
differences between the two formulations are examined analytically and
numerically with the aim of establishing conditions under which the proposals
might be tested by experiment. It is found that quantum regime conditions
produce the biggest differences between the formulations which are otherwise
near indistinguishable. These results indicate that in order to discriminate
conclusively among the different alternatives, the corresponding experimental
test should be performed in the quantum regime and with sufficiently high
resolution so as to resolve small quantum efects.
