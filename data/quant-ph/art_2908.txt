Quantum Memory for Light
We propose an efficient method for mapping and storage of a quantum state of
propagating light in atoms. The quantum state of the light pulse is stored in
two sublevels of the ground state of a macroscopic atomic ensemble by
activating a synchronized Raman coupling between the light and atoms. We
discuss applications of the proposal in quantum information processing and in
atomic clocks operating beyond quantum limits of accuracy. The possibility of
transferring the atomic state back on light via teleportation is also
discussed.
