Scale decoherence in inhomogeneous potentials
Finite precision measurement factors the Hilbert space of a quantum system
into a tensor product $H_{coarse} \otimes H_{fine}$. This is mathematically
equivalent to the partition into system and environment which forms the arena
for decoherence, so we describe the consequences of the inaccessibility of
$H_{fine}$ as scale decoherence. Considering the experimentally important case
of a harmonic oscillator potential as well as a periodic piecewise constant
potential, we show that scale decoherence occurs for inhomogeneous potentials
and may explain part of the decoherence observed in recent and proposed
experiments on mesoscopic superpositions of quantum states.
