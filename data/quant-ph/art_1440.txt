Critique of Protective Measurements
Recently proposed idea of "protective" measurement of a quantum state is
critically examined, and generalized. Earlier criticisms of the idea are
discussed and their relevance to the proposal assessed. Several constraints on
measuring apparatus required by "protective" measurements are discussed, with
emphasis on how they may restrict their experimental feasibility. Though
"protective" measurements result in an unchanged system state and a shift of
the pointer proportional to the expectation value of the measured observable in
the system state, the actual reading of the pointer position gives rise to
several subtleties. We propose several schemes for reading pointer position,
both when the apparatus is treated as a classical system as well as when its
quantum aspects are taken into account, that address these issues. The tiny
entanglement which is always present due to deviation from extreme adiabaticity
in realistic situations is argued to be the weakest aspect of the proposal.
Because of this, one can never perform a protective measurement on a single
quantum system with absolute certainty. This clearly precludes an ontological
status for the wave function. Several other conceptual issues are also
discussed.
