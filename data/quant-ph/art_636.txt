Quantum distribution functions for radial observables
For quantum systems with two dimensional configuration space we construct a
physical radial momentum observable. Rescaling the radius we find the dilatonic
degrees of freedom form a Weyl algebra. With this we construct the radial
Wigner quasi-probability distribution function.
