Experimental Quantum Error Correction
Quantum error correction is required to compensate for the fragility of the
state of a quantum computer. We report the first experimental implementations
of quantum error correction and confirm the expected state stabilization. In
NMR computing, however, a net improvement in the signal-to-noise would require
very high polarization. The experiment implemented the 3-bit code for phase
errors in liquid state state NMR.
