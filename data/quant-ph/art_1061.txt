Miller-Good Method for Symmetric Double Potential Wells
The ground state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator is calculated by
employing the Miller-Good method. For this purpose an extension of the
procedure is developed, which is suitable for considering four turning points
situations. A criterion for the selection of the auxiliary quantum mechanical
problem is also advanced.
