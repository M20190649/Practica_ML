Design of gates for quantum computation: the three-spin XOR gate in
  terms of two-spin interactions
We propose to design multispin quantum gates in which the input and output
two-state systems (spins) are not necessarily identical. We describe the
motivations for such studies and then derive an explicit general two-spin
interaction Hamiltonian which accomplishes the quantum XOR gate function for a
system of three spins: two input and one output.
