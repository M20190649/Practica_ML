"Haunted" quantum contextuality
Two entangled particles in threedimensional Hilbert space (per particle) are
considered in an EPR-type arrangement. On each side the Kochen-Specker
observables $\{J_1^2,J_2^2,J_3^2\}$ and $\{\bar J_1^2, \bar J_2^2,J_3^2\}$ with
$[J_1^2,\bar J_1^2]\neq 0$ are measured. The outcomes of measurements of
$J_3^2$ (via $J_1^2,J_2^2$) and $J_3^2$ (via $\bar J_1^2,\bar J_2^2$) are
compared. Although formally $J_3^2$ is associated with the same projection
operator, a strong form of quantum contextuality states that an outcome depends
on the complete disposition of the measurement apparatus, in particular whether
$J_1^2$ or $\bar J_1^2$ is measured alongside. It is argued that in this case
it is impossible to measure contextuality directly, a necessary condition being
a non-operational counterfactuality of the argument.
