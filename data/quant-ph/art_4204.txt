Robust and Fragile Entanglement of Three Qubits: Relation to Permutation
  Symmetry
Entanglement properties of a basic set of eight entangled three particle pure
states possessing certain permutation symmetries are studied. They fall into
four sets of two entangled states, differing in their patterns of robustness to
entanglement when one of the states is lost. These features are related to the
permutation symmetries of the spin states of the three particles and their
corresponding marginal two-particle states. It is interesting to note that the
eight entangled three-qubit states discussed here are eigenstates of a
three-spin Heisenberg Hamiltonian.
