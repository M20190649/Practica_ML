Superconvergent Perturbation Method in Quantum Mechanics
An analogue of Kolmogorov's superconvergent perturbation theory in classical
mechanics is constructed for self adjoint operators. It is different from the
usual Rayleigh--Schr\"odinger perturbation theory and yields expansions for
eigenvalues and eigenvectors in terms of functions of the perturbation
parameter.
