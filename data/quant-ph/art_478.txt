Bose-stimulated scattering off a cold atom trap
The angle and temperature dependence of the photon scattering rate for
Bose-stimulated atom recoil transitions between occupied states is compared to
diffraction and incoherent Rayleigh scattering near the Bose-Einstein
transition for an optically thin trap in the limit of large particle number, N.
Each of these processes has a range of angles and temperatures for which it
dominates over the others by a divergent factor as N->oo.
