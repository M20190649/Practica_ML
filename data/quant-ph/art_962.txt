Fluorescence into flat and structured radiation continua: An atomic
  density matrix without a master equation
We investigate an atomic $\Lambda$-system with one transition coupled to a
laser field and a flat continuum of vacuum modes and the other transition
coupled to field modes near the edge of a photonic band gap. The system
requires simultaneous treatment of Markovian and non-Markovian dissipation
processes, but the photonic band gap continuum can not be eliminated within a
density matrix treatment. Instead we propose a formalism based on Monte-Carlo
wavefunctions, and we present results relevant to an experimental
characterization of a structured continuum.
