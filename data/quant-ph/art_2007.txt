Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox and Antiparticle
The original version of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is discussed to
show the completeness of Quantum Mechanics (QM). The unique solution leads to
the wave function of antiparticle unambiguously, which implies the essential
conformity between QM and Special Relativity (SR).
