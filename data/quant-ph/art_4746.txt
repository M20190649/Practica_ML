Submicroscopic Deterministic Quantum Mechanics
So-called hidden variables introduced in quantum mechanics by de Broglie and
Bohm have changed their initial enigmatic meanings and acquired quite
reasonable outlines of real and measurable characteristics. The start viewpoint
was the following: All the phenomena, which we observe in the quantum world,
should reflect structural properties of the real space. Thus the scale 10^{-28}
cm at which three fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak, and strong)
intersect has been treated as the size of a building block of the space. The
appearance of a massive particle is associated with a local deformation of the
cellular space, i.e. deformation of a cell. The mechanics of a moving particle
that has been constructed is deterministic by its nature and shows that the
particle interacts with cells of the space creating elementary excitations
called "inertons". The further study has disclosed that inertons are a
substructure of the matter waves which are described by the orthodox wave
\psi-function formalism. The concept has allowed resolving the spin problem.
The theory, or more exactly, the existence of inertons, has been verified
experimentally: in rarefied gases, inerton clouds of atoms' electrons interact
with a strong laser pulse; in a solid, atom's inertons induce an additional
harmonic potential that contributes to the interatomic interaction (metal
specimens and the KIO_3*HIO_3 crystal).
