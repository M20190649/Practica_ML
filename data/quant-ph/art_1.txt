Photon Statistics of a Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum
We investigate the general case of the photon distribution of a two-mode
squeezed vacuum and show that the distribution of photons among the two modes
depends on four parameters: two squeezing parameters, the relative phase
between the two oscillators and their spatial orientation. The distribution of
the total number of photons depends only on the two squeezing parameters. We
derive analytical expressions and present pictures for both distributions.
