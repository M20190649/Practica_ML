A counterexample to a conjectured entanglement inequality
We give an explicit counterexample to an entanglement inequality suggested in
a recent paper [quant-ph/0005126] by Benatti and Narnhofer. The inequality
would have had far-reaching consequences, including the additivity of the
entanglement of formation.
