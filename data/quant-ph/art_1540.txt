Klein Tunnelling and the Klein Paradox
The Klein paradox is reassessed by considering the properties of a finite
square well or barrier in the Dirac equation. It is shown that spontaneous
positron emission occurs for a well if the potential is strong enough. The
vacuum charge and lifetime of the well are estimated. If the well is wide
enough, a seemingly constant current is emitted. These phenomena are transient
whereas the tunnelling first calculated by Klein is time-independent. Klein
tunnelling is a property of relativistic wave equations, not necessarily
connected to particle emission. The Coulomb potential is investigated in this
context: it is shown that a heavy nucleus of sufficiently large $Z$ will bind
positrons. Correspondingly, it is expected that as $Z$ increases the Coulomb
barrier will become increasingly transparent to positrons. This is an example
of Klein tunnelling.
