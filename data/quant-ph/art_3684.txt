Interference of macroscopic superpositions
We propose a simple experimental procedure based on the Elitzur-Vaidman
scheme to test the persistence of macroscopic superpositions. We conjecture
that its implementation will reveal the persistence of superpositions of
macroscopic objects in the absence of a direct act of observation.
