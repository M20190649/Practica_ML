Resolving the space-time structure of sonoluminescence by intensity
  interferometry
We analyze the spatial and temporal resolving power of two-photon intensity
interferometry for the light emitting source in single bubble sonoluminescence
(SBSL). We show that bubble sizes between several 10 nm and 3 um can be
resolved by measuring the transverse correlation function, but that a direct
determination of the flash duration via the longitudinal correlation function
works only for SBSL pulses which are shorter than 0.1 ps. Larger pulse lengths
can be determined indirectly from the intercept of the angular correlator at
equal photon frequencies. The dynamics of the bubble is not accessible by
two-photon interferometry.
