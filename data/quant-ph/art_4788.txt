Quantum Operations, State Transformations and Probabilities
In quantum operations, probabilities characterise both the degree of the
success of a state transformation and, as density operator eigenvalues, the
degree of mixedness of the final state. We give a unified treatment of
pure-to-pure state transformations, covering both probabilistic and
deterministic cases. We then discuss the role of majorization in describing the
dynamics of mixing in quantum operations. The conditions for mixing enhancement
for all initial states are derived. We show that mixing is monotonically
decreasing for deterministic pure-to-pure transformations, and discuss the
relationship between these transformations and deterministic LOCC entanglement
transformations.
