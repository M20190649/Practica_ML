Time-Dependent Invariants for Dirac Equation and Newton-Wigner Position
  Operator
For Dirac equation, operator-invariants containing explicit time-dependence
in parallel to known time-dependent invariants of nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger
equation are introduced and discussed. As an example, a free Dirac particle is
considered and new invariants are constructed for it. The integral of motion,
which is initial Newton-Wigner position operator, is obtained explicitly for a
free Dirac particle. For such particle with kick modeled by delta-function of
time, the time-depending integral, which has physical meaning of initial
momentum, is found.
