A sequence of unsharp measurements enabling a real time visualization of
  a quantum oscillation
The normalized state $\ket{\psi(t)}=c_1(t)\ket{1}+c_2(t)\ket{2}$ of a single
two-level system performs oscillations under the influence of a resonant
driving field. It is assumed that only one realization of this process is
available. We show that it is possible to approximately visualize in real time
the evolution of the system as far as it is given by $|c_2(t)|^2$. For this
purpose we use a sequence of particular unsharp measurements separated in time.
They are specified within the theory of generalized measurements in which
observables are represented by positive operator valued measures (POVM). A
realization of the unsharp measurements may be obtained by coupling the
two-level system to a meter and performing the usual projection measurements on
the meter only.
