Dirac's hole theory versus quantum field theory
Dirac's hole theory and quantum field theory are usually considered
equivalent to each other. For models of a certain type, however, the
equivalence may not hold as we discuss in this Letter. This problem is closely
related to the validity of the Pauli principle in intermediate states of
perturbation theory.
