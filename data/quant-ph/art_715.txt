On Reliability Function of Quantum Communication Channel
The reliability function gives the rate of exponential convergence to zero of
the error probability in a communication channel. In this paper bounds for the
reliability function of a quantum pure state channel are given, reminiscent of
the corresponding classical bounds. This in particular suggests an alternative
proof of the coding theorem for quantum noiseless channel, which would make no
use of the notion of typical subspace. Example of binary quantum channel is
considered in some detail.
