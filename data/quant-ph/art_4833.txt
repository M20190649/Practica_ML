Comment on "Classical interventions in quantum systems II. Relativistic
  invariance"
In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A 61, 022117 (2000)], quant-ph/9906034, A.
Peres argued that quantum mechanics is consistent with special relativity by
proposing that the operators that describe time evolution do not need to
transform covariantly, although the measurable quantities need to transform
covariantly. We discuss the weaknesses of this proposal.
