Classical model for bulk-ensemble NMR quantum computation
We present a classical model for bulk-ensemble NMR quantum computation: the
quantum state of the NMR sample is described by a probability distribution over
the orientations of classical tops, and quantum gates are described by
classical transition probabilities. All NMR quantum computing experiments
performed so far with three quantum bits can be accounted for in this classical
model. After a few entangling gates, the classical model suffers an exponential
decrease of the measured signal, whereas there is no corresponding decrease in
the quantum description. We suggest that for small numbers of quantum bits, the
quantum nature of NMR quantum computation lies in the ability to avoid an
exponential signal decrease.
