Entanglement transfer from continuous variables to qubits
We show that two qubits can be entangled by local interactions with an
entangled two-mode continuous variable state. This is illustrated by the
evolution of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode squeezed state.
Two modes of the squeezed field are injected respectively into two spatially
separate cavities and the atoms are then sent into the cavities to resonantly
interact with the cavity field. We find that the atoms may be entangled even by
a two-mode squeezed state which has been decohered while penetrating into the
cavity.
