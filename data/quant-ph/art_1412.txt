Quantum Information in a Distributed Apparatus
We investigate the information provided about a specified distributed
apparatus of n units in the measurement of a quantum state. It is shown that,
in contrast to such measurement of a classical state, which is bounded by log
(n+1) bits, the information in a quantum measurement is bounded by 3.7 x
n^(1/2) bits. This means that the use of quantum apparatus offers an
exponential advantage over classical apparatus.
