Atomic Retrodiction
Measurement of a quantum system provides information concerning the state in
which it was prepared. In this paper we show how the retrodictive formalism can
be used to evaluate the probability associated with any one of a given set of
preparation events. We illustrate our method by calculating the retrodictive
density operator for a two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field.
