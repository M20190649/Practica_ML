Supersymmetric quantum mechanics with nonlocal potentials
We consider supersymmetric quantum mechanical models with both local and
nonlocal potentials. We present a nonlocal deformation of exactly solvable
local models. Its energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are determined exactly.
We observe that both our model Hamiltonian and its supersymmetric partner may
have normalizable zero-energy ground states, in contrast to local models with
nonperiodic or periodic potentials.
