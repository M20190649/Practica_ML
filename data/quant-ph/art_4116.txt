Quantum computation by quantum-like systems
Using a quantumlike description for light propagation in nonhomogeneous
optical fibers, quantum information processing can be implemented by optical
means. Quantum-like bits (qulbits) are associated to light modes in the optical
fiber and quantum gates to segments of the fiber providing an unitary
transformation of the mode structure along a space direction. Simulation of
nonlinear quantum effects is also discussed.
