Short-range oscillators in power-series picture
A class of short-range potentials on the line is considered as an
asymptotically vanishing phenomenological alternative to the popular confining
polynomials. We propose a method which parallels the analytic Hill-Taylor
description of anharmonic oscillators and represents all our Jost solutions
non-numerically, in terms of certain infinite hypergeometric-like series. In
this way the well known solvable Rosen-Morse and scarf models are generalized.
