No-Concentrating Theorem of Pure Entangled States
Suppose two distant observers Alice and Bob share a pure biparticle entangled
state secretly chosen from a set, it is shown that Alice (Bob) can
probabilistic concentrate the state to a maximally entangled state by applying
local operations and classical communication (LQCC) if and only if the states
in the set share the same marginal density operator for her (his) subsystem.
Applying this result, we present probabilistic superdense coding and show that
perfect purification of mixed state is impossible using only LQCC on individual
particles.
