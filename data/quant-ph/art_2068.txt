Quantum noise in the position measurement of a cavity mirror undergoing
  Brownian motion
We perform a quantum theoretical calculation of the noise power spectrum for
a phase measurement of the light output from a coherently driven optical cavity
with a freely moving rear mirror. We examine how the noise resulting from the
quantum back action appears among the various contributions from other noise
sources. We do not assume an ideal (homodyne) phase measurement, but rather
consider phase modulation detection, which we show has a different shot noise
level. We also take into account the effects of thermal damping of the mirror,
losses within the cavity, and classical laser noise. We relate our theoretical
results to experimental parameters, so as to make direct comparisons with
current experiments simple. We also show that in this situation, the standard
Brownian motion master equation is inadequate for describing the thermal
damping of the mirror, as it produces a spurious term in the steady-state phase
fluctuation spectrum. The corrected Brownian motion master equation [L. Diosi,
Europhys. Lett. {\bf 22}, 1 (1993)] rectifies this inadequacy.
