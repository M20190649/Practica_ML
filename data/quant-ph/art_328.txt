Improvement of measurement accuracy in SU(1,1) interferometers
We consider an SU(1,1) interferometer employing four-wave mixers that is fed
with two-mode states which are both coherent and intelligent states of the
SU(1,1) Lie group. It is shown that the phase sensitivity of the interferometer
can be essentially improved by using input states with a large photon-number
difference between the modes.
