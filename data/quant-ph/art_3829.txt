Concepts of a quantum information theory of many letters
A theoretical framework is presented allowing the treatment of quantum
messages with components of variable length. To this aim a many-letter space,
similiar to the Fock space, is constructed, generalizing the standard quantum
information theory of block messages of fixed length. In the many-letter space
a length operator can be defined measuring the length of a quantum message,
whose eigenspaces are the block Hilbert spaces used in the standard theory.
