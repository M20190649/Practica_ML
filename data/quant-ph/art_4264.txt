Experimental verification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for
  hot fullerene molecules
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for material objects is an essential
corner stone of quantum mechanics and clearly visualizes the wave nature of
matter. Here we report a demonstration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
for the most massive, complex and hottest single object so far, the fullerene
molecule C70 at a temperature of 900 K. We find a good quantitative agreement
with the theoretical expectation: dx * dp = h, where dx is the width of the
restricting slit, dp is the momentum transfer required to deflect the fullerene
to the first interference minimum and h is Planck's quantum of action.
