`Circular type' quantum key distribution
`Circular type' interferometric system for quantum key distribution is
proposed. The system has naturally self-alignment and compensation of
birefringence and also has enough efficiency against polarisation dependence.
Moreover it is easily applicable to multi-party. Key creation with 0.1 photon
per pulse at a rate of 1.2KHz with a 5.4% QBER over a 200m fiber was realized.
