Probabilistic implementation of universal quantum processors
We present a probabilistic quantum processor for qudits. The processor itself
is represented by a fixed array of gates. The input of the processor consists
of two registers. In the program register the set of instructions (program) is
encoded. This program is applied to the data register. The processor can
perform any operation on a single qudit of the dimension N with a certain
probability. If the operation is unitary, the probability is in general 1/N^2,
but for more restricted sets of operators the probability can be higher. In
fact, this probability can be independent of the dimension of the qudit Hilbert
space of the qudit under some conditions.
