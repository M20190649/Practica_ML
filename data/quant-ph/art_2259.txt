Quantum soliton generation using an interferometer
For the first time a method for realizing macroscopic quantum optical
solitons is presented. Simultaneous photon-number and momentum squeezing is
predicted using soliton propagation in an interferometer. Extraction of soliton
pulses closer to true quantum solitons than their coherent counterparts from
mode-locked lasers is possible. Moreover, it is a general method of reducing
photon-number fluctuations below the shot-noise level for non-soliton pulses as
well. It is anticipated that similar reductions in particle fluctuations could
occur for other forms of interfering bosonic fields whenever self-interaction
nonlinearities exist, for example, interacting ultracold atoms.
