Comment on `Quantum-Anti-Zeno Paradox'
One can reduce the involved derivation of Balachandran and Roy of their
`anti-Zeno' effect [Phys.Rev.Lett. 84, 4019 (2000)] to the derivation of
standard Zeno effect. The mechanism of what the authors call `anti-Zeno' effect
is a dynamic version of Zeno effect.
