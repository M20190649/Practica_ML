Universal quantum computation by holonomic and nonlocal gates with
  imperfections
We present a nonlocal construction of universal gates by means of holonomic
(geometric) quantum teleportation. The effect of the errors from imperfect
control of the classical parameters, the looping variation of which builds up
holonomic gates, is investigated. Additionally, the influence of quantum
decoherence on holonomic teleportation used as a computational primitive is
studied. Advantages of the holonomic implementation with respect to control
errors and dissipation are presented.
