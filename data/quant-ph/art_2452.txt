Coherent two-field spectroscopy of degenerate two-level systems
Spectroscopic features revealing the coherent interaction of a degenerate
two-level atomic system with two optical fields are examined. A model for the
numerical calculation of the response of a degenerate two-level system to the
action of an arbitrarily intense resonant pump field and a weak probe in the
presence of a magnetic field is presented. The model is valid for arbitrary
values of the total angular momentum of the lower and upper levels and for any
choice of the polarizations of the optical waves. Closed and open degenerate
two-level systems are considered. Predictions for probe absorption and
dispersion, field generation by four-wave-mixing, population modulation and
Zeeman optical pumping are derived. On all these observables, sub-natural-width
coherence resonances are predicted and their spectroscopic features are
discussed. Experimental spectra for probe absorption and excited state
population modulation in the D2 line of Rb vapor are presented in good
agreement with the calculations
