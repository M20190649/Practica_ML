On Wolter's vortex in total reflection
The "circulatory wave" ("die zirkulierende Welle") put into evidence in 1949
by Wolter (Wolter's vortex) in total reflection is interpreted as a phase
defect in the scalar theory of Green and Wolf of 1953, which is the Madelung
(hydrodynamic) representation of the optical field. Some comments are added on
its possible relevance for the Hamamatsu experiment aimed to clarify the
wave-particle duality at the "single photon" level of down-converted laser
beams
