Quantum Games and Quantum Strategies
We investigate the quantization of non-zero sum games. For the particular
case of the Prisoners' Dilemma we show that this game ceases to pose a dilemma
if quantum strategies are allowed for. We also construct a particular quantum
strategy which always gives reward if played against any classical strategy.
