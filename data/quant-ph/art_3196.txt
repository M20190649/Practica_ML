The Haroche-Ramsey experiment as a generalized measurement
A number of atomic beam experiments, related to the Ramsey experiment and a
recent experiment by Brune et al., are studied with respect to the question of
complementarity. Three different procedures for obtaining information on the
state of the incoming atom are compared. Positive operator-valued measures are
explicitly calculated. It is demonstrated that, in principle, it is possible to
choose the experimental arrangement so as to admit an interpretation as a joint
non-ideal measurement yielding interference and ``which-way'' information.
Comparison of the different measurements gives insight into the question of
which information is provided by a (generalized) quantum mechanical
measurement. For this purpose the subspaces of Hilbert-Schmidt space, spanned
by the operators of the POVM, are determined for different measurement
arrangements and different values of the parameters.
