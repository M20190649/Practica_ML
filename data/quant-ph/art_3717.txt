The Backwards-Time Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics - Revisited With
  Experiment
The classic paper of Clauser et al proved that Bell's Theorem experiments
rule out all theories of physics which assume locality, time-forwards causality
and the existence of an objective real world. The Backwards-Time Interpretation
(BTI) tries to recover realism and locality by permitting backwards time
causality. BTI should permit dramatic simplification of the assumptions or
axioms of physics, but requires new work in fundamental mathematics, such as
new tools for the "closure of turbulence," the derivation of statistics
generated by ODE or PDE.
  Recent events like the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment of Kim, Shih
et al have increased mainstream interest in the possibility of backwards
causality. The Backwards Time Quantum Teleportation (BTQT) experiment will take
this further. True backwards time communication channels (BTCC) are absolutely
impossible in most formulations of quantum theory but only almost impossible in
the BTI formulation. This paper discusses BTQT, the issue of backwards
causality in different versions of quantum theory and new mathematical
developments. It defines a new object, the "entropy matrix," which leads to
closure of turbulence for PDE systems. Predictions of a common toy field theory
(real phi-3 QFT) are reproduced by the corresponding PDE model combined with a
new model of the micro/macro interface (2M/M).
