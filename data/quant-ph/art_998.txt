NMR GHZ
We describe the creation of a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of the
form |000>+|111> (three maximally entangled quantum bits) using Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR). We have successfully carried out the experiment using
the proton and carbon spins of trichloroethylene, and confirmed the result
using state tomography. We have thus extended the space of entangled quantum
states explored systematically to three quantum bits, an essential step for
quantum computation.
