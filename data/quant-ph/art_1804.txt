Mesoscopic superpositions of states - approach to classicality and
  diagonalization in coherent state basis
I consider the interaction of a superposition of mesoscopic coherent states
and its approach to a mixed state as a result of a suitably controlled
environment. I show how the presence of a gain medium in a cavity can lead to
diagonalization in coherent state basis in contrast to the standard model of
decoherence. I further show how the new model of decoherence can lead to the
generation of $s$ ordered quasi distributions.
