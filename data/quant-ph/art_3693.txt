A unified approach for exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics
  using shift operators
We present a unified approach for solving and classifying exactly solvable
potentials. Our unified approach encompasses many well-known exactly solvable
potentials. Moreover, the new approach can be used to search systematically for
a new class of solvable potentials.
