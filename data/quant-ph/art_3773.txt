Off Resonant Pumping for Transition from Continuous to Discrete Spectrum
  and Quantum Revivals in Systems in Coherent States
We show that in parametrically driven systems and, more generally, in systems
in coherent states, off-resonant pumping can cause a transition from a
continuum energy spectrum of the system to a discrete one, and result in
quantum revivals of the initial state. The mechanism responsible for quantum
revivals in the present case is different from that in the non-linear
wavepacket dynamics of systems such as Rydberg atoms. We interpret the reported
phenomena as an optical analog of Bloch oscillations realized in Fock space and
propose a feasible scheme for inducing Bloch oscillations in trapped ions.
