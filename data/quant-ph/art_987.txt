EPR correlations and EPW distributions revisited
It is shown that Bell's proof of violation of local realism in phase space is
incorrect. Using Bell's approach, a violation can be derived also for
nonnegative Wigner distributions. The error is found to lie in the use of an
unnormalizable Wigner function.
