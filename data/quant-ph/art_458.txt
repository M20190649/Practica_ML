Nonclassical interferometry with intelligent light
We study the phase sensitivity of SU(2) and SU(1,1) interferometers fed by
two-mode field states which are intelligent states for Hermitian generators of
the SU(2) and SU(1,1) groups, respectively. Intelligent states minimize
uncertainty relations and this makes possible an essential reduction of the
quantum noise in interferometers. Exact closed expressions for the minimum
detectable phase shift are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. These
expressions are compared with results for some conventional input states, and
some known results for the squeezed input states are reviewed. It is shown that
the phase sensitivity for an interferometer that employs squeezing-producing
active devices (such as four-wave mixers) should be analyzed in two regimes:
(i) fixed input state and variable interferometer, and (ii) fixed
interferometer and variable input state. The behavior of the phase sensitivity
is essentially different in these two regimes. The use of the SU(2) intelligent
states allows us to achieve a phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ (where
$\bar{N}$ is the total number of photons passing through the phase shifters of
the interferometer) without adding four-wave mixers. This avoids the duality in
the behavior of the phase sensitivity that occurs for the squeezed input. On
the other hand, the SU(1,1) intelligent states have the property of achieving
the phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ in both regimes.
