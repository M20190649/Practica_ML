Universal Fault-Tolerant Computation on Decoherence-Free Subspaces
A general scheme to perform universal quantum computation within
decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs) of a system's Hilbert space is presented.
This scheme leads to the first fault-tolerant realization of universal quantum
computation on DFSs with the properties that (i) only one- and two-qubit
interactions are required, and (ii) the system remains within the DFS
throughout the entire implementation of a quantum gate. We show explicitly how
to perform universal computation on clusters of the four-qubit DFS encoding one
logical qubit each under "collective decoherence" (qubit-permutation-invariant
system-bath coupling). Our results have immediate relevance to a number of
solid-state quantum computer implementations, in particular those in which
quantum logic is implemented through exchange interactions, such as the
recently proposed spin-spin coupled GaAs quantum dot arrays and the Si:$^{31}$P
nuclear spin arrays.
