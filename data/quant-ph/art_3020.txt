Anharmonic oscillators energies via artificial perturbation method
A new pseudoperturbative (artificial in nature) methodical proposal [15] is
used to solve for Schrodinger equation with a class of phenomenologically
useful and methodically challenging anharmonice oscillator potentials
V(q)=\alpha_o q^2 + \alpha q^4. The effect of the [4,5] Pade' approximant on
the leading eigenenergy term is studied. Comparison with results from numerical
(exact) and several eligible (approximation) methods is made.
