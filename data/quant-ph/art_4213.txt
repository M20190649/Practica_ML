Time Evolution of tunneling and decoherence: soluble model
Decoherence effects associated to the damping of a tunneling two-level system
are shown to dominate the tunneling probability at short times in strong
coupling regimes in the context of a soluble model. A general decomposition of
tunneling rates in dissipative and unitary parts is implemented. Master
equation treatments fail to describe the model system correctly when more than
a single relaxation time is involved.
