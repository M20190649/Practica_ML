Quantum gates using two-electron states of triple quantum dot
Quantum computation using electron spins in three coupled dot with different
size is proposed. By using the energy selectivity of both photon assisted
tunneling and spin rotation of electrons, logic gates are realized by static
and rotational magnetic field and resonant optical pulses. Possibility of
increasing the number of quantum bits using the energy selectivity is also
discussed.
