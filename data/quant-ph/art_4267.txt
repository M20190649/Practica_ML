Self-consistent non-Markovian theory of a quantum state evolution for
  quantum information processing
It is shown that the operator sum representation for non-Markovian dynamics
and the Lindblad master equation in Markovian limit can be derived from a
formal solution to quantum Liouville equation for a qubit system in the
presence of decoherence processes self-consistently. Our formulation is the
first principle theory based on projection-operator formalism to obtain an
exact reduced density operator in time-convolutionless form starting from the
quantum Liouville equation for a noisy quantum computer. The advantage of our
approach is that it is general enough to describe a realistic quantum computer
in the presence of decoherence provided details of the Hamiltonians are known.
