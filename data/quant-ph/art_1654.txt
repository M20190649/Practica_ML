General teleportation channel, singlet fraction and quasi-distillation
We prove a theorem on direct relation between the optimal fidelity $f_{max}$
of teleportation and the maximal singlet fraction $F_{max}$ attainable by means
of trace-preserving LQCC action (local quantum and classical communication).
For a given bipartite state acting on $C^d\otimes C^d$ we have $f_{max}=
{F_{max}d+1\over d+1}$. We assume completely general teleportation scheme
(trace preserving LQCC action over the pair and the third particle in unknown
state). The proof involves the isomorphism between quantum channels and a class
of bipartite states. We also exploit the technique of $U\otimes U^*$ twirling
states (random application of unitary transformation of the above form) and the
introduced analogous twirling of channels. We illustrate the power of the
theorem by showing that {\it any} bound entangled state does not provide better
fidelity of teleportation than for the purely classical channel. Subsequently,
we apply our tools to the problem of the so-called conclusive teleportation,
then reduced to the question of optimal conclusive increasing of singlet
fraction. We provide an example of state for which Alice and Bob have no chance
to obtain perfect singlet by LQCC action, but still singlet fraction
arbitrarily close to unity can be obtained with nonzero probability. We show
that a slight modification of the state has a threshold for singlet fraction
which cannot be exceeded anymore.
