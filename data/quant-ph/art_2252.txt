Control of Decoherence and Relaxation by Frequency Modulation of Heat
  Bath
We demonstrate in a very general fashion, considerable slowing down of
decoherence and relaxation by fast frequency modulation of the system heat bath
coupling. The slowing occurs as the decoherence rates are now determined by the
spectral components of bath correlations which are shifted due to fast
modulation. We present several examples including the slowing down of the
heating of a trapped ion, where the system - bath interaction is not
necessarily Markovian.
