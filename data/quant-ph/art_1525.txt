Good Quantum Convolutional Error Correction Codes And Their Decoding
  Algorithm Exist
Quantum convolutional code was introduced recently as an alternative way to
protect vital quantum information. To complete the analysis of quantum
convolutional code, I report a way to decode certain quantum convolutional
codes based on the classical Viterbi decoding algorithm. This decoding
algorithm is optimal for a memoryless channel. I also report three simple
criteria to test if decoding errors in a quantum convolutional code will
terminate after a finite number of decoding steps whenever the Hilbert space
dimension of each quantum register is a prime power. Finally, I show that
certain quantum convolutional codes are in fact stabilizer codes. And hence,
these quantum stabilizer convolutional codes have fault-tolerant
implementations.
