Ponderomotive Control of Quantum Macroscopic Coherence
It is shown that because of the radiation pressure a Schr\"odinger cat state
can be generated in a resonator with oscillating wall. The optomechanical
control of quantum macroscopic coherence and its detection is taken into
account introducing new cat states. The effects due to the environmental
couplings with this nonlinear system are considered developing an operator
perturbation procedure to solve the master equation for the field mode density
operator.
