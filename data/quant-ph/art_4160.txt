Distillability Criterion for all Bipartite Gaussian States
We prove that all inseparable Gaussian states of two modes can be distilled
into maximally entangled pure states by local operations. Using this result we
show that a bipartite Gaussian state of arbitrarily many modes can be distilled
if and only if its partial transpose is not positive.
