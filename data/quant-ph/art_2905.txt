Will Quantum Cryptography ever become a successful technology in the
  marketplace?
We assess the potential of quantum cryptography as a technology. We highlight
the fact that academia and real world have rather different perspectives and
interests. Then, we describe the various real life forces (different types of
users, vendors of crypto-systems, conventional cryptographers, governments)
behind the decision of the adoption (or rejection) of quantum cryptography and
their different interests. Various roadblocks to the widespread application of
quantum cryptography are discussed. Those roadblocks can be fundamental,
technological, psychological, commercial or political and many of them have
nothing to do with the security of quantum key distribution. We argue that the
future success of quantum cryptography as a technology in the marketplace lies
in our ability to appreciate and to overcome those roadblocks and to answer
real world criticisms on the subject.
