Jamming non-local quantum correlations
We present a possible scheme to tamper with non-local quantum correlations in
a way that is consistent with relativistic causality, but goes beyond quantum
mechanics. A non-local ``jamming" mechanism, operating within a certain
space-time window, would not violate relativistic causality and would not lead
to contradictory causal loops. The results presented in this Letter do not
depend on any model of how quantum correlations arise and apply to any jamming
mechanism.
