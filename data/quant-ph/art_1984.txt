Quantum photon emission from a moving mirror in the nonperturbative
  regime
We consider the coupling of the electromagnetic vacuum field with an
oscillating perfectly-reflecting mirror in the nonrelativistic approximation.
As a consequence of the frequency modulation associated to the motion of the
mirror, low frequency photons are generated. We calculate the photon emission
rate by following a nonperturbative approach, in which the coupling between the
field sidebands is taken into account. We show that the usual perturbation
theory fails to account correctly for the contribution of TM-polarized vacuum
fluctuations that propagate along directions nearly parallel to the plane
surface of the mirror.
  As a result of the modification of the field eigenfunctions, the resonance
frequency for photon emission is shifted from its unperturbed value.
