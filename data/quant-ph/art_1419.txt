Scalable NMR Quantum Computation
Nuclear magnetic resonance offers an appealing prospect for implementation of
quantum computers, because of the long coherence times associated with nuclear
spins, and extensive laboratory experience in manipulating the spins with radio
frequency pulses. Existing proposals, however, suffer from a signal-to-noise
ratio that decays exponentially in the number of qubits in the quantum
computer. This places a severe limit on the size of the computations that can
be performed by such a computer; estimates of that limit are well within the
range in which a conventional computer taking exponentially more steps would
still be practical.
  We give an NMR implementation in which the signal-to-noise ratio depends only
on features of NMR technology, not the size of the computer. This provides a
means for NMR computation techniques to scale to sizes at which the exponential
speedup enables quantum computation to solve problems beyond the capabilities
of classical computers.
