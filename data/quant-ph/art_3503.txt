The information interpretation of quantum mechanics
In the information interpretation of quantum mechanics, information is the
most fundamental, basic entity. Every quantized system is associated with a
definite discrete amount of information (cf. Zeilinger). This information
content remains constant at all times and is permutated one-to-one throughout
the system evolution. What is interpreted as measurement is a particular type
of information transfer over a fictitious interface. The concept of a
many-to-one state reduction is not a fundamental one but results from the
practical impossibility to reconstruct the original state after the
measurement.
