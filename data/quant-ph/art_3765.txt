Why do Bell experiments?
Experiments over three decades have been unable to demonstrate weak
nonlocality in the sense of Bell unambiguously, without loopholes. The last
important loophole remaining is the detection loophole, which is being tackled
by at least three experimental groups. This letter counters five common beliefs
about Bell experiments, and presents alternative scenarios for future
developments.
