Consistent histories, quantum truth functionals, and hidden variables
A central principle of consistent histories quantum theory, the requirement
that quantum descriptions be based upon a single framework (or family), is
employed to show that there is no conflict between consistent histories and a
no-hidden-variables theorem of Bell, and Kochen and Specker, contrary to a
recent claim by Bassi and Ghirardi. The argument makes use of ``truth
functionals'' defined on a Boolean algebra of classical or quantum properties.
