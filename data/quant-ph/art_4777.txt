Weak force detection with superposed coherent states
We investigate the utility of non classical states of simple harmonic
oscillators, particularly a superposition of coherent states, for sensitive
force detection. We find that like squeezed states a superposition of coherent
states allows displacement measurements at the Heisenberg limit. Entangling
many superpositions of coherent states offers a significant advantage over a
single mode superposition states with the same mean photon number.
