Manipulating motional states by selective vibronic interaction in two
  trapped ions
We present a selective vibronic interaction for manipulating motional states
in two trapped ions, acting resonantly on a previously chosen vibronic subspace
and dispersively on all others. This is done respecting technical limitations
on ionic laser individual addressing. We discuss the generation of Fock states
and entanglement in the ionic collective motional degrees of freedom, among
other applications.
