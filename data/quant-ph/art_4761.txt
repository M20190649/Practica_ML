Coherent Control of Magneto-optical Rotation in Inhomogeneously
  Broadened Medium
We extend our earlier investigations [Opt. Commun. {\bf 179}, 97 (2000)] on
the enhancement of magneto-optical rotation (MOR) to include inhomogeneous
broadening. We introduce a control field that counter-propagates with respect
to the probe field. We derive analytical results for the susceptibilities
corresponding to the two circular polarization components of the probe field.
  From the analytical results we identify and numerically demonstrate the
region of parameters where significantly large magneto-optical rotation (MOR)
can be obtained. From the numerical results we isolate the significance of the
magnetic field and the control field in enhancement of MOR. The control field
opens up many new regions of the frequencies of the probe where large
magneto-optical rotation occurs. We also report that a large enhancement of MOR
can be obtained by operating the probe and control field in two-photon
resonance condition.
