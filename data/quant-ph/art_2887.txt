Temperature Variation of Ultra Slow Light in a Cold Gas
A model is developed to explain the temperature dependence of the group
velocity as observed in the experiments of Hau et al (Nature {\bf397}, 594
(1999)). The group velocity is quite sensitive to the change in the spatial
density. The inhomogeneity in the density and its temperature dependence are
primarily responsible for the observed behavior.
