Negative Binomial States of the Radiation Field and their Excitations
  are Nonlinear Coherent States
We show that the well-known negative binomial states of the radiation field
and their excitations are nonlinear coherent states. Excited nonlinear coherent
state are still nonlinear coherent states with different nonlinear functions.
We finally give exponential form of the nonlinear coherent states and remark
that the binomial states are not nonlinear coherent states.
