Natural capacity of a system of two two-level atoms as a quantum
  information channel
A system of two closely spaced atoms interacting through a vacuum
electromagnetic field is considered. It is demonstrated that radiative decay in
such a system resulting from photon exchange gives rise to a definite amount of
information related to interatomic communication. Joint distributions of
detection probabilities of atomic quanta and the corresponding amount of
communication information are calculated.
