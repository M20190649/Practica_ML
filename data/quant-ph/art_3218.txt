Reply to a review of photon-exchange interactions by Opatrny and Kurizki
In a recent review article, Opatrny and Kurizki [submitted to Fortschr.
Phys., e-print quant-ph/0003010] discussed a number of issues related to the
feasibility of quantum computation based on photon-exchange interactions. This
Reply summarizes my view of each of the issues and the overall prospects for
quantum computing based on photon-exchange interactions.
