Non-linear operations in quantum information theory
Quantum information theory is used to analize various non-linear operations
on quantum states. The universal disentanglement machine is shown to be
impossible, and partial (negative) results are obtained in the state-dependent
case. The efficiency of the transformation of non-orthogonal states into
orthogonal ones is discussed.
