Spin flips and quantum information for anti-parallel spins
We consider two different ways to encode quantum information, by parallel or
anti-parallel pairs of spins. We find that there is more information in the
anti-parallel ones. This purely quantum mechanical effect is due to
entanglement, not of the states but occuring in the course of the measuring
process. We also introduce a range of quantum information processing machines,
such as spin-flip and anti-cloning.
