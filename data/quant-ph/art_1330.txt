Generalization of Dirac Non-Linear Electrodynamics, and Spinning Charged
  Particles
In this note we generalized the Dirac non-linear electrodynamics, by
introducing two potentials (namely, the vector potential A and the
pseudo-vector potential gamma^5 B of the electromagnetic theory with charges
and magnetic monopoles) and by imposing the pseudoscalar part of the product
omega.omega* to be zero, with omega = A + gamma^5 B. We show that the field
equations of such a theory possess a soliton-like solution which can represent
a priori a "charged particle", since it is endowed with a Coulomb field plus
the field of a magnetic dipole. The rest energy of the soliton is finite, and
the angular momentum stored in its electromagnetic field can be identified
--for suitable choices of the parameters-- with the spin of the charged
particle. Thus this approach seems to yield a classical model for the charged
(spinning) particle, which does not meet the problems met by earlier attempts
in the same direction.
