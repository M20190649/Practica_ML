Spectra and generalized eigenfunctions of the one- and two-mode
  squeezing operators in quantum optics
The spectra and generalized eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic and parabolic
generators of the standard representation of SU(1,1) in the one-mode boson
Hilbert space are derived. The eigenfunctions are given in three different
forms, corresponding to the coordinate, photon number, and Fock-Bargmann
representations of the state vectors. The possible spectra of general second
degree Hamiltonians are determined. Some corresponding results in the two-mode
case are also given. - In the Appendix we prove completeness and orthonormality
relations for the polynomials giving the number representation expansion
coefficients of the generalized eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic generator (=
squeezing generator). These polynomials are special cases of Pollaczek
polynomials.
