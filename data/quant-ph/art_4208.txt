Non-adiabatically detecting the geometric phase of the macroscopic
  quantum state with symmetric SQUID
We give a simple way to detect the geometric phase shift and the conditional
geometric phase shift with Josephson junction system. Comparing with the
previous work(Falcl G, Fazio R, Palma G.M., Siewert J and Verdal V, {\it
Nature} {\bf 407}, 355(2000)), our scheme has two advantages. We use the
non-adiabatic operation, thus the detection is less affected by the
decoherence. Also, we take the time evolution on zero dynamic phase loop, we
need not take any extra operation to cancel the dynamic phase.
