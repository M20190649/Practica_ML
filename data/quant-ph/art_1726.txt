Pulsed energy-time entangled twin-photon source for quantum
  communication
A pulsed source of energy-time entangled photon pairs pumped by a standard
laser diode is proposed and demonstrated. The basic states can be distinguished
by their time of arrival. This greatly simplifies the realization of 2-photon
quantum cryptography, Bell state analyzers, quantum teleportation, dense
coding, entanglement swapping, GHZ-states sources, etc. Moreover the
entanglement is well protected during photon propagation in telecom optical
fibers, opening the door to few-photon applications of quantum communication
over long distances.
