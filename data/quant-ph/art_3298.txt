Fundamental bounds on quantum measurements with a mixed apparatus
We consider the apparatus in a quantum measurement process to be in a mixed
state. We propose a simple upper bound on the probability of correctly
distinguishing any number of mixed states. We use this to derive fundamental
bounds on the efficiency of a measurement in terms of the temperature of the
apparatus.
