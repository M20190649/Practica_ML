Quantum Physics and Computers
Recent theoretical results confirm that quantum theory provides the
possibility of new ways of performing efficient calculations. The most striking
example is the factoring problem. It has recently been shown that computers
that exploit quantum features could factor large composite integers. This task
is believed to be out of reach of classical computers as soon as the number of
digits in the number to factor exceeds a certain limit. The additional power of
quantum computers comes from the possibility of employing a superposition of
states, of following many distinct computation paths and of producing a final
output that depends on the interference of all of them. This ``quantum
parallelism'' outstrips by far any parallelism that can be thought of in
classical computation and is responsible for the ``exponential'' speed-up of
computation.
  This is a non-technical (or at least not too technical) introduction to the
field of quantum computation. It does not cover very recent topics, such as
error-correction.
