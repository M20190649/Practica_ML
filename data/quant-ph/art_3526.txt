Quantum decoherence of excitons in a leaky cavity with quasimode
For the excitons in the quantum well placed within a leaky cavity, the
quantum decoherence of a mesoscopically superposed states is investigated based
on the factorization theory for quantum dissipation. It is found that the
coherence of the exciton superposition states will decrease in an oscillating
form when the cavity field interacting with the exciton is of the form of
quasimode. The effect of the thermal cavity fields on the quantum decoherence
of the superposition states of the exciton is studied and it is observed that
the higher the temperature of the environment is, the shorter the decoherence
characteristic time is.
