Engineering arbitrary motional ionic state through realistic
  intensity-fluctuating laser pulses
We present a reliable scheme for engineering arbitrary motional ionic states
through an adaptation of the projection synthesis technique for trapped-ion
phenomena. Starting from a prepared coherent motional state, the Wigner
function of the desired state is thus sculpted from a Gaussian distribution.
The engineering process has also been developed to take into account the errors
arising from intensity fluctuations in the exciting-laser pulses required for
manipulating the electronic and vibrational states of the trapped ion. To this
end, a recently developed phenomenological-operator approach that allows for
the influence of noise will be applied. This approach furnishes a
straightforward technique to estimate the fidelity of the prepared state in the
presence of errors, precluding the usual extensive ab initio calculations. The
results obtained here by the phenomenological approach, to account for the
effects of noise in our engineering scheme, can be directly applied to any
other process involving trapped-ion phenomena.
