Implications of Teleportation for Nonlocality
Adopting an approach similar to that of Zukowski [Phys. Rev. A 62, 032101
(2000)], we investigate connections between teleportation and nonlocality. We
derive a Bell-type inequality pertaining to the teleportation scenario and show
that it is violated in the case of teleportation using a perfect singlet. We
also investigate teleportation using `Werner states' of the form x P + (1-x)
I/4, where P is the projector corresponding to a singlet state and I is the
identity. We find that our inequality is violated, implying nonlocality, if x >
1/sqrt(2). In addition, we extend Werner's local hidden variable model to
simulation of teleportation with the x = 1/2 Werner state. Thus teleportation
using this state does not involve nonlocality even though the fidelity achieved
is 3/4 which is greater than the `classical limit' of 2/3. Finally, we comment
on a result of Gisin's and offer some philosophical remarks on teleportation
and nonlocality generally.
