Phase measurements at the theoretical limit
It is well known that the result of any phase measurement on an optical mode
made using linear optics has an introduced uncertainty in addition to the
intrinsic quantum phase uncertainty of the state of the mode. The best
previously published technique [H. M. Wiseman and R.B. Killip, Phys. Rev. A 57,
2169 (1998)] is an adaptive technique that introduces a phase variance that
scales as n^{-1.5}, where n is the mean photon number of the state. This is far
above the minimum intrinsic quantum phase variance of the state, which scales
as n^{-2}. It has been shown that a lower limit to the phase variance that is
introduced scales as ln(n)/n^2. Here we introduce an adaptive technique that
attains this theoretical lower limit.
