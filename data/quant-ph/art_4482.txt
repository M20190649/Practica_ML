Trapped-Atom-Interferometer in a Magnetic Microtrap
We propose a configuration of a magnetic microtrap which can be used as an
interferometer for three-dimensionally trapped atoms. The interferometer is
realized via a dynamic splitting potential that transforms from a single well
into two separate wells and back. The ports of the interferometer are
neighboring vibrational states in the single well potential. We present a
one-dimensional model of this interferometer and compute the probability of
unwanted vibrational excitations for a realistic magnetic potential. We
optimize the speed of the splitting process in order suppress these excitations
and conclude that such interferometer device should be feasible with currently
available microtrap technique.
