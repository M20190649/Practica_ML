Quantum-Non-Demolition Endoscopic Tomography
We present a new indirect method to measure the quantum state of a single
mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity. Our proposal combines the idea
of (endoscopic) probing and that of tomography in the sense that the signal
field is coupled via a quantum-non-demolition Hamiltonian to a meter field on
which then quantum state tomography is performed using balanced homodyne
detection. This technique provides full information about the signal state. We
also discuss the influence of the measurement of the meter on the signal field.
