Aharonov-Bohm scattering of neutral atoms with induced electric dipole
  moments
We investigate the scattering of neutral polarizable atoms from an
electrically charged wire placed in a homogeneous magnetic field. The atoms
carry an induced electric dipole. The reflecting wire is discussed. We
calculate the scattering amplitude and cross section the practically more
important case that atoms are totally absorbed at the surface of the wire. If
the magnetic field is present, there is a dominating Aharonov-Bohm peak in the
forward direction followed by decreasing oscillations for larger angles. An
experimental realization of this modulated Aharonov-Bohm scattering should be
possible.
