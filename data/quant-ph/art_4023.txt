Nonlocal variables with product states eigenstates
An alternative proof for existence of ``quantum nonlocality without
entanglement'', i.e. existence of variables with product-state eigenstates
which cannot be measured locally, is presented. A simple``nonlocal'' variable
for the case of one-way communication is given and the limit for its
approximate measurability is found.
