Pilot Wave Steerage: A Mechanism and Test
An intuitive, generic, physical model, or conceptual paradigm for pilot wave
steerage of particle beams based on Stochastic Electrodynamics is presented.
The utility of this model for understanding the Pauli Exclusion Principle is
briefly considered, and a possible experimental verification for the underlying
concepts is proposed. \\[7mm] Key words: Quantum Mechanics, Pilot Wave, Pauli
