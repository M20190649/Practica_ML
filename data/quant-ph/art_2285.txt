Toward fault-tolerant quantum computation without concatenation
It has been known that quantum error correction via concatenated codes can be
done with exponentially small failure rate if the error rate for physical
qubits is below a certain accuracy threshold. Other, unconcatenated codes with
their own attractive features-improved accuracy threshold, local
operations-have also been studied. By iteratively distilling a certain
two-qubit entangled state it is shown how to perform an encoded Toffoli gate,
important for universal computation, on CSS codes that are either
unconcatenated or, for a range of very large block sizes, singly concatenated.
