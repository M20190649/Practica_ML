Fidelity and the communication of quantum information
We compare and contrast the error probability and fidelity as measures of the
quality of the receiver's measurement strategy for a quantum communications
system. The error probability is a measure of the ability to retrieve {\it
classical} information and the fidelity measures the retrieval of {\it quantum}
information. We present the optimal measurement strategies for maximising the
fidelity given a source that encodes information on the symmetric qubit-states.
