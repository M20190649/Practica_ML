"Quantal" behavior in classical probability
A number of phenomena generally believed characteristic of quantum mechanics
and seen as interpretively problematic--the incompatibility and
value-indeterminacy of variables, the non-existence of dispersion-free states,
the failure of the standard marginal-probability formula, the failure of the
distributive law of disjunction and interference--are exemplified in an
emphatically non-quantal system: a deck of playing cards. Thus the appearance,
in quantum mechanics, of incompatibility and these associated phenomena
requires neither explanation nor interpretation.
