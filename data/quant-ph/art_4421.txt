Decoherence in a classically chaotic quantum system: entropy production
  and quantum--classical correspondence
We study the decoherence process for an open quantum system which is
classically chaotic (a quartic double well with harmonic driving coupled to a
sea of harmonic oscillators). We analyze the time dependence of the rate of
entropy production showing that it has two relevant regimes: For short times it
is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (fixed by the system--environment
coupling strength). For longer times (but before equilibration) it is fixed by
dynamical properties of the system (and is related to the Lyapunov exponent).
The nature of the transition time between both regimes is investigated and the
issue of quantum to classical correspondence is addressed. Finally, the impact
of the interaction with the environment on coherent tunneling is analyzed.
