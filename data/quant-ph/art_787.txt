Rigorous results on Schroedinger operators with certain Gaussian random
  potentials in multi-dimensional continuous space
Schroedinger operators with certain Gaussian random potentials in
multi-dimensional Euclidean space possess almost surely an absolutely
continuous integrated density of states and no absolutely continuous spectrum
at sufficiently low energies.
