Two non-orthogonal states can be cloned by a unitary-reduction process
We show that, there are physical means for cloning two non-orthogonal pure
states which are secretly chosen from a certain set $% \$={ | \Psi_0 > , |
\Psi_1 > }$. The states are cloned through a unitary evolution together with a
measurement. The cloning efficiency can not attain 100%. With some negative
measurement results, the cloning fails.
