A position-momentum EPR state of distantly-separated trapped atoms
We propose a scheme for preparing an EPR state in position and momentum of a
pair of distantly-separated trapped atoms. The scheme utilizes the entangled
light fields output from a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier. Quantum
state exchange between these fields and the motional states of the trapped
atoms is accomplished via interactions in cavity QED.
