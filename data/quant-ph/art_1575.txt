Reconstruction of Liouvillian Superoperators
We show how to determine (reconstruct) a master equation governing the time
evolution of an open quantum system.
  We present a general algorithm for the reconstruction of the corresponding
Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamics of a two-level atom in various
environments is discussed in detail.
