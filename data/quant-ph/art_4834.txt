Quantum Nonlocality for a Mixed Entangled Coherent State
Quantum nonlocality is tested for an entangled coherent state, interacting
with a dissipative environment. A pure entangled coherent state violates Bell's
inequality regardless of its coherent amplitude. The higher the initial
nonlocality, the more rapidly quantum nonlocality is lost. The entangled
coherent state can also be investigated in the framework of $2\times2$ Hilbert
space. The quantum nonlocality persists longer in $2\times2$ Hilbert space.
When it decoheres it is found that the entangled coherent state fails the
nonlocality test, which contrasts with the fact that the decohered entangled
state is always entangled.
