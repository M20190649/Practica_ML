Nonlocal character of quantum theory?
In a recent article under the above title (but without the question mark)
Henry Stapp presented arguments which lead him to conclude that under suitable
conditions ``the truth of a statement that refers only to phenomena confined to
an earlier time'' must ``depend on which measurement an experimenter freely
chooses to perform at a later time.'' I point out that the reasoning leading to
this conclusion relies on an essential ambiguity regarding the meaning of the
expression ``statement that refers only to phenomena confined to an earlier
time'' when such a statement contains counterfactual conditionals. As a result
the argumentation does not justify the conclusion that there can be frames of
reference in which future choices can affect present facts. But it does provide
an instructive and interestingly different opportunity to illustrate a central
point of Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.
