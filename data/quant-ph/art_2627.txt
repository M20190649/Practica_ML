Schemes for Parallel Quantum Computation Without Local Control of Qubits
Typical quantum computing schemes require transformations (gates) to be
targeted at specific elements (qubits). In many physical systems, direct
targeting is difficult to achieve; an alternative is to encode local gates into
globally applied transformations. Here we demonstrate the minimum physical
requirements for such an approach: a one-dimensional array composed of two
alternating 'types' of two-state system. Each system need be sensitive only to
the net state of its nearest neighbors, i.e. the number in state 1 minus the
number in state 2. Additionally, we show that all such arrays can perform quite
general parallel operations. A broad range of physical systems and interactions
are suitable: we highlight two potential implementations.
