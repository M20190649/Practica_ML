Hypersurface Bohm-Dirac models
We define a class of Lorentz invariant Bohmian quantum models for N entangled
but noninteracting Dirac particles. Lorentz invariance is achieved for these
models through the incorporation of an additional dynamical space-time
structure provided by a foliation of space-time. These models can be regarded
as the extension of Bohm's model for N Dirac particles, corresponding to the
foliation into the equal-time hyperplanes for a distinguished Lorentz frame, to
more general foliations. As with Bohm's model, there exists for these models an
equivariant measure on the leaves of the foliation. This makes possible a
simple statistical analysis of position correlations analogous to the
equilibrium analysis for (the nonrelativistic) Bohmian mechanics.
