Relativistic quantum coin tossing
A relativistic quantum information exchange protocol is proposed allowing two
distant users to realize ``coin tossing'' procedure. The protocol is based on
the point that in relativistic quantum theory reliable distinguishing between
the two orthogonal states generally requires a finite time depending on the
structure of these states.
