Some Comments on Three Suggested Postulates for Quantum Theory
Three basic postulates for Quantum Theory are proposed, namely the
Probability, Maximum-Speed and Hilbert-Space postulates. Subsequently we show
how these postulates give rise to well-known and widely used quantum results,
as the probability rule and the linearity of quantum evolution. A discussion of
the postulates in the light of Bell's theorem is included which points towards
yet unsolved conceptual problems in the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.
