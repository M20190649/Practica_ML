Collective tests for quantum nonlocality
Pairs of spin-1/2 particles are prepared in a Werner state (namely, a mixture
of singlet and random components). If the random component is large enough, the
statistical results of spin measurements that may be performed on each pair
separately can be reproduced by an algorithm involving local ``hidden''
variables. However, if several such pairs are tested simultaneously, a
violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality may occur, and no local
hidden variable model is compatible with the results.
