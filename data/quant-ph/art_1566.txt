Quantum telecloning and multiparticle entanglement
A quantum telecloning process combining quantum teleportation and optimal
quantum cloning from one input to M outputs is presented. The scheme relies on
the establishment of particular multiparticle entangled states, which function
as multiuser quantum information channels. The entanglement structure of these
states is analyzed and shown to be crucial for this type of information
processing.
