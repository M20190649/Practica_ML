A scheme for total quantum teleportation
We address the issue of totally teleporting the quantum state of an external
particle, as opposed to studies on partial teleportation of external
single-particle states, total teleportation of coherent states and encoded
single-particle states, and intramolecular teleportation of nuclear spin
states. We find a set of commuting observables whose measurement directly
projects onto the Bell-basis and discuss a possible experiment, based on
two-photon absorption, allowing, for the first time, total teleportation of the
state of a single external photon through a direct projective measurement.
