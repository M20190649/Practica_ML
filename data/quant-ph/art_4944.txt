The Spin
It is shown that the spin is naturally introduced into classical mechanics if
the latter is formulated as dynamics of the phase space density. It is shown
that the uncertainty principle, as the amendment in this dynamics, restricts
possible spins, and in particular equation for the particle with the spin
$\hbar /2$ is derived. Also equation for the charge with this spin is derived
when electromagnetic field is included. In one example it is shown that the
modulus of the spin changes with the gradient of the magnetic field.
