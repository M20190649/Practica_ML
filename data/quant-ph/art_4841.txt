Relativity of representations in quantum mechanics
Only the position representation is used in introductory quantum mechanics
and the momentum representation is not usually presented until advanced
undergraduate courses. To emphasize the relativity of the representations of
the abstract formulation of quantum mechanics, two examples of representations
related to the operators aX+(1-a)P and (XP+PX)/2 are presented.
