From Classical State-Swapping to Quantum Teleportation
The quantum teleportation protocol is extracted directly out of a standard
classical circuit that exchanges the states of two qubits using only
controlled-NOT gates. This construction of teleportation from a classically
transparent circuit generalizes straightforwardly to d-state systems.
