Quantum algorithms which accept hot qubit inputs
Realistic physical implementations of quantum computers can entail tradeoffs
which depart from the ideal model of quantum computation. Although these
tradeoffs have allowed successful demonstration of certain quantum algorithms,
a crucial question is whether they fundamentally limit the computational
capacity of such machines. We study the limitations of a quantum computation
model in which only ensemble averages of measurement observables are
accessible. Furthermore, we stipulate that input qubits may only be prepared in
highly random, ``hot'' mixed states. In general, these limitations are believed
to dramatically detract from the computational power of the system. However, we
construct a class of algorithms for this limited model, which, surprisingly,
are polynomially equivalent to the ideal case. This class includes the well
known Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
