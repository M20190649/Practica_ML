Transverse-mode coupling in a Kerr medium
We analyze nonlinear transverse mode coupling in a Kerr medium placed in an
optical cavity and its influence on bistability and different kinds of quantum
noise reduction. Even for an input beam that is perfectly matched to a cavity
mode, the nonlinear coupling produces an excess noise in the fluctuations of
the output beam. Intensity squeezing seems to be particularly robust with
respect to mode coupling, while quadrature squeezing is more sensitive.
However, it is possible to find a mode the quadrature squeezing of which is not
affected by the coupling.
