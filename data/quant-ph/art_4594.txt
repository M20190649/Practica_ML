Security of quantum key distribution using d-level systems
We consider two quantum cryptographic schemes relying on encoding the key
into qudits, i.e. quantum states in a d-dimensional Hilbert space. The first
cryptosystem uses two mutually unbiased bases (thereby extending the BB84
scheme), while the second exploits all the d+1 available such bases (extending
the six-state protocol for qubits). We derive the information gained by a
potential eavesdropper applying a cloning-based individual attack, along with
an upper bound on the error rate that ensures unconditional security against
coherent attacks.
