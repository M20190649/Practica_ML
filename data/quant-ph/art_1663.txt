Method of quantum computation with ``hot'' trapped ions
We present a novel method of performing quantum logic gates in trapped ion
quantum computers which does not require the ions to be cooled down to their
vibrational center of mass (CM) mode ground state. Our scheme employs adiabatic
passages and the conditional phase shift first investigated by D'Helon and
Milburn (C.~D'Helon and G.J.~Milburn, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 54}, 5141 (1996)).
