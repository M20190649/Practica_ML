Nonlinear level crossing models
We examine the effect of nonlinearity at a level crossing on the probability
for nonadiabatic transitions $P$. By using the Dykhne-Davis-Pechukas formula,
we derive simple analytic estimates for $P$ for two types of nonlinear
crossings. In the first type, the nonlinearity in the detuning appears as a
{\it perturbative} correction to the dominant linear time dependence. Then
appreciable deviations from the Landau-Zener probability $P_{LZ}$ are found to
appear for large couplings only, when $P$ is very small; this explains why the
Landau-Zener model is often seen to provide more accurate results than
expected. In the second type of nonlinearity, called {\it essential}
nonlinearity, the detuning is proportional to an odd power of time. Then the
nonadiabatic probability $P$ is qualitatively and quantitatively different from
$P_{LZ}$ because on the one hand, it vanishes in an oscillatory manner as the
coupling increases, and on the other, it is much larger than $P_{LZ}$. We
suggest an experimental situation when this deviation can be observed.
