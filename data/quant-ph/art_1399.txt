Optimal distinction between non-orthogonal quantum states
Given a finite set of linearly independent quantum states, an observer who
examines a single quantum system may sometimes identify its state with
certainty. However, unless these quantum states are orthogonal, there is a
finite probability of failure. A complete solution is given to the problem of
optimal distinction of three states, having arbitrary prior probabilities and
arbitrary detection values. A generalization to more than three states is
outlined.
