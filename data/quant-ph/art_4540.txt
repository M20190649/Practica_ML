Doubly--dressed atomic wave packets
The problems of cavity atom optics in the presence of an external strong
coherent field are formulated as the problems of potential scattering of
doubly-dressed atomic wave packets. Two types of potentials produced by various
multiphoton Raman processes in a high-finesse cavity are examined. As an
application the deflection of dressed atomic wave by a cavity mode is
investigated. New momentum distribution of the atoms is derived that depends
from the parameters of coherent field as well as photon states in the cavity.
