Universality of optimal measurements
We present optimal and minimal measurements on identical copies of an unknown
state of a qubit when the quality of measuring strategies is quantified with
the gain of information (Kullback of probability distributions). We also show
that the maximal gain of information occurs, among isotropic priors, when the
state is known to be pure. Universality of optimal measurements follows from
our results: using the fidelity or the gain of information, two different
figures of merits, leads to exactly the same conclusions. We finally
investigate the optimal capacity of $N$ copies of an unknown state as a quantum
channel of information.
