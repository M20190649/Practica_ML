Two-state system driven by imperfect pi pulses: an estimate of the error
  accumulation in bang-bang control methods
The evolution of a two-state system driven by a sequence of imperfect pi
pulses (with random phase or amplitude errors) is calculated. The resulting
decreased fidelity is used to derive a plausible limit on the performance of
"bang-bang" control methods for the suppression of decoherence.
