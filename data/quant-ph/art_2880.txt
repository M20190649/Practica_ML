A model independent approach to non dissipative decoherence
We consider the case when decoherence is due to the fluctuations of some
classical variable or parameter of a system and not to its entanglement with
the environment. Under few and quite general assumptions, we derive a
model-independent formalism for this non-dissipative decoherence, and we apply
it to explain the decoherence observed in some recent experiments in cavity QED
and on trapped ions.
