Wigner-Weyl-Moyal Formalism on Algebraic Structures
We first introduce the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism for a theory whose
phase-space is an arbitrary Lie algebra. We also generalize to quantum Lie
algebras and to supersymmetric theories. It turns out that the
non-commutativity leads to a deformation of the classical phase-space: instead
of being a vector space it becomes a manifold, the topology of which is given
by the commutator relations. It is shown in fact that the classical
phase-space, for a semi-simple Lie algebra, becomes a homogenous symplectic
manifold. The symplectic product is also deformed. We finally make some
comments on how to generalize to $C^*$-algebras and other operator algebras
too.
