Is the quantum state (an) observable?
We explore the sense in which the state of a physical system may or may not
be regarded (an) observable in quantum mechanics. Simple and general arguments
from various lines of approach are reviewed which demonstrate the following
no-go claims: (1) the structure of quantum mechanics precludes the
determination of the state of a single system by means of measurements
performed on that system only; (2) there is no way of using entangled
two-particle states to transmit superluminal signals. Employing the
representation of observables as general positive operator valued measures, our
analysis allows one to indicate whether optimal separation of different states
is achieved by means of sharp or unsharp observables.
