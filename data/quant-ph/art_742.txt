Nonbinary quantum codes
We present several results on quantum codes over general alphabets (that is,
in which the fundamental units may have more than 2 states). In particular, we
consider codes derived from finite symplectic geometry assumed to have
additional global symmetries. From this standpoint, the analogues of
Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and of GF(4)-linear codes turn out to be special
cases of the same construction. This allows us to construct families of quantum
codes from certain codes over number fields; in particular, we get analogues of
quadratic residue codes, including a single-error correcting code encoding one
letter in five, for any alphabet size. We also consider the problem of
fault-tolerant computation through such codes, generalizing ideas of Gottesman.
