Fundamentals of Relativity Providing Time, Distance and Velocity
  Standards
The paper presents an attempt to suggest an alternative way of considering
the fundamentals of Einstein's special relativity theory. Its formulation based
on introducing an inertial reference system by rigid linking of clocks to a
free entity to define proper time is self-contradictory since the operation of
rigid linking involves interaction which is excluded by definition for a free
entity. The way to overcome this inconsistency is proposed by postulating that
each free entity (object, particle) has to be ideal clocks by itself, providing
ideal internal time standards defined by the only intrinsic feature of a free
entity, namely its proper mass which means that de Broglie's periodic
phenomenon has to be considered as a fundamental principle needed to built the
special relativity, along with the principle of indistinguishability allowing
to define the particle's proper mass with ideal accuracy. Further, the internal
distance standard is provided by passing to Compton wavelength and the velocity
standard is introduced by means of Hubble's law. It is proposed to interpret
the wave function as an internal system of reference undergoing distortion when
external interaction is included.
