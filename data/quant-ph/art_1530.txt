Transition from antibunching to bunching for two dipole-interacting
  atoms
It is known that there is a transition from photon antibunching to bunching
in the resonance fluorescence of a driven system of two two-level atoms with
dipole-dipole interaction when the atomic distance decreases and the other
parameters are kept fixed. We give a simple explanation for the underlying
mechanism which in principle can also be applied to other systems. PACS numbers
