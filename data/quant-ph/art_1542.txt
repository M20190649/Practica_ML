The Halting Problem for Quantum Computers
We argue that the halting problem for quantum computers which was first
raised by Myers, is by no means solved, as has been claimed recently. We
explicitly demonstrate the difficulties that arise in a quantum computer when
different branches of the computation halt at different, unknown, times.
