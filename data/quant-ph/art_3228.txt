The Coulomb - harmonic oscillator correspondence in PT-symmetric quantum
  mechanics
We show that and how the Coulomb potential can be regularized and solved
exactly at the imaginary couplings. The new spectrum of energies is real and
bounded as expected, but its explicit form proves totally different from the
usual real-coupling case.
