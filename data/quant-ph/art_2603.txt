Unextendible Product Bases, Uncompletable Product Bases and Bound
  Entanglement
We report new results and generalizations of our work on unextendible product
bases (UPB), uncompletable product bases and bound entanglement. We present a
new construction for bound entangled states based on product bases which are
only completable in a locally extended Hilbert space. We introduce a very
useful representation of a product basis, an orthogonality graph. Using this
representation we give a complete characterization of unextendible product
bases for two qutrits. We present several generalizations of UPBs to arbitrary
high dimensions and multipartite systems. We present a sufficient condition for
sets of orthogonal product states to be distinguishable by separable
superoperators. We prove that bound entangled states cannot help increase the
distillable entanglement of a state beyond its regularized entanglement of
formation assisted by bound entanglement.
