Experimental Proposal for Achieving Superadditive Communication
  Capacities with a Binary Quantum Alphabet
We demonstrate superadditivity in the communication capacity of a binary
alphabet consisting of two nonorthogonal quantum states. For this scheme,
collective decoding is performed two transmissions at a time. This improves
upon the previous schemes of Sasaki et al. [Phys. Rev. A 58, 146 (1998)] where
superadditivity was not achieved until a decoding of three or more
transmissions at a time. This places superadditivity within the regime of a
near-term laboratory demonstration. We propose an experimental test based upon
an alphabet of low photon-number coherent states where the signal decoding is
done with atomic state measurements on a single atom in a high-finesse optical
cavity.
