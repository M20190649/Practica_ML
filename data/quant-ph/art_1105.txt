Complementarity and Young's interference fringes from two atoms
The interference pattern of the resonance fluorescence from a J=1/2 to J=1/2
transition of two identical atoms confined in a three-dimensional harmonic
potential is calculated. Thermal motion of the atoms is included. Agreement is
obtained with experiments [Eichmann et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2359 (1993)].
Contrary to some theoretical predictions, but in agreement with the present
calculations, a fringe visibility greater than 50% can be observed with
polarization-selective detection. The dependence of the fringe visibility on
polarization has a simple interpretation, based on whether or not it is
possible in principle to determine which atom emitted the photon.
