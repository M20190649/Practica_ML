Berry's phase in view of quantum estimation theory, and its intrinsic
  relation with the complex structure
In this paper, it is pointed out that the Berry's phase is a good index of
degree of no-commutativity of the quantum statistical model. Intrinsic
relations between the `complex structure' of the Hilbert space and Berry's
phase is also discussed.
