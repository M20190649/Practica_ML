Bohm Confirmed by NonRelativistic Quark Model
The effectiveness of the NonRelativistic Quark Model of hadrons can be
explained by Bohm's quantum theory applied to a fermion confined in a box, in
which the fermion is at rest because its kinetic energy is transformed into
PSI-field potential energy. Since that aspect of Bohm's quantum theory is not a
property of most other formulations of quantum theory, the effectiveness of the
NonRelativistic Quark Model confirms Bohm's quantum theory as opposed to those
others.
