Ladder proof of nonlocality without inequalities and without
  probabilities
The ladder proof of nonlocality without inequalities for two spin half
particles proposed by Hardy et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 79 (1997) 2755) works only
for nonmaximally entangled states and goes through for 50% of pairs at the
most. A similar ladder proof for two spin-1 particles in a maximally entangled
state is presented. In its simplest form, the proof goes through for 17% of
pairs. An extended version works for 100% of pairs. The proof can be extended
to any maximally entangled state of two spin-s particles (with s equal or
greater than 1).
