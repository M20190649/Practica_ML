The Exact Solution to the Schr√∂dinger Equation with the Octic
  Potential
The Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the central potential is first studied in
the arbitrary dimensional spaces and obtained an analogy of the two-dimensional
Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the radial wave function through a simple
transformation. As an example, applying an ${\it ansatz}$ to the
eigenfunctions, we then arrive at an exact closed form solution to the modified
two-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the octic potential,
$V(r)=ar^2-br^4+cr^6-dr^4+er^{10}$.
