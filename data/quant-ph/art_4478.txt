Violations of local realism by two entangled quNits
Results obtained in two recent papers, \cite{Kaszlikowski} and \cite{Durt},
seem to indicate that the nonlocal character of the correlations between the
outcomes of measurements performed on entangled systems separated in space is
not robust in the presence of noise. This is surprising, since entanglement
itself is robust. Here we revisit this problem and argue that the class of
gedanken-experiments considered in \cite{Kaszlikowski} and \cite{Durt} is too
restrictive. By considering a more general class, involving sequences of
measurements, we prove that the nonlocal correlations are in fact robust.
