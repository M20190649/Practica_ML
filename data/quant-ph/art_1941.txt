Accessible information and optimal strategies for real symmetrical
  quantum sources
We study the problem of optimizing the Shannon mutual information for sources
of real quantum states i.e. sources for which there is a basis in which all the
states have only real components. We consider in detail the sources ${\cal
E}_M$ of $M$ equiprobable qubit states lying symmetrically around the great
circle of real states on the Bloch sphere and give a variety of explicit
optimal strategies. We also consider general real group-covariant sources for
which the group acts irreducibly on the subset of all real states and prove the
existence of a real group-covariant optimal strategy, extending a theorem of
Davies (E. B. Davies, IEEE. Inf. Theory {\bf IT-24}, 596 (1978)). Finally we
propose an optical scheme to implement our optimal strategies, enough simple to
be realized with present technology.
