A classical ontology for quantum phenomena
Quantum mechanics states that a particle emitted at point (x_1,t_1) and
detected at point (x_2,t_2) does not travel along a definite path between the
two points. This conclusion arises essentially from the analysis of the
two-slit experiment, which implicitly assumes (as in the demonstration of the
EPR paradox) that a property we will call Independence Property holds. This
paper shows that this assumption is not indispensable. Abandoning the
assumption allows to develop an ontology where particle motion is described by
classical paths and quantum phenomena are interpreted as a manifestation of a
contingent law, i.e., of a law deriving from the boundary conditions of the
universe, such as the second law of thermodynamics. The paper also proposes an
equation having a typical quantum-like structure to represent the contingent
laws of the universe.
