Interference of probabilities and number field structure of quantum
  models
We study the probabilistic consequences of the choice of the basic number
field in quantum formalism. We demonstrate that by choosing a number field for
a linear space representation of quantum model it is possible to describe
various interference phenomena. We analyse interference of probabilistic
alternatives induced by real, complex, hyperbolic (Clifford) and p-adic
representations.
