Quantum Key Distribution between N partners: optimal eavesdropping and
  Bell's inequalities
Quantum secret-sharing protocols involving N partners (NQSS) are key
distribution protocols in which Alice encodes her key into $N-1$ qubits, in
such a way that all the other partners must cooperate in order to retrieve the
key. On these protocols, several eavesdropping scenarios are possible: some
partners may want to reconstruct the key without the help of the other ones,
and consequently collaborate with an Eve that eavesdrops on the other partners'
channels. For each of these scenarios, we give the optimal individual attack
that the Eve can perform. In case of such an optimal attack, the authorized
partners have a higher information on the key than the unauthorized ones if and
only if they can violate a Bell's inequality.
