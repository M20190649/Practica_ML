Quantum codewords contradict local realism
Quantum codewords are highly entangled combinations of two-state systems. The
standard assumptions of local realism lead to logical contradictions similar to
those found by Bell, Kochen and Specker, Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, and
Mermin. The new contradictions have some noteworthy features that did not
appear in the older ones.
