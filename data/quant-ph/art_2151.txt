Excited Binomial States and Excited Negative Binomial States of the
  Radiation Field and Some of their Statistical Properties
We introduce excited binomial states and excited negative binomial states of
the radiation field by repeated application of the photon creation operator on
binomial states and negative binomial states. They reduce to Fock states and
excited coherent states in certain limits and can be viewed as intermediate
states between Fock states and coherent states. We find that both the excited
binomial states and excited negative binomial states can be exactly normalized
in terms of hypergeometric functions. Base on this interesting character, some
of the statistical properties are discussed.
