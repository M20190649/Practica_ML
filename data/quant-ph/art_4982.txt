On the concepts of radial and angular kinetic energies
We consider a general central-field system in D dimensions and show that the
division of the kinetic energy into radial and angular parts proceeds
differently in the wavefunction picture and the Weyl-Wigner phase-space
picture. Thus, the radial and angular kinetic energies are different quantities
in the two pictures, containing different physical information, but the
relation between them is well defined. We discuss this relation and illustrate
its nature by examples referring to a free particle and to a ground-state
hydrogen atom.
