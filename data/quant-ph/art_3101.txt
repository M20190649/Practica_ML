Tailoring of vibrational state populations with light-induced potentials
  in molecules
We propose a method for achieving highly efficient transfer between the
vibrational states in a diatomic molecule. The process is mediated by strong
laser pulses and can be understood in terms of light-induced potentials. In
addition to describing a specific molecular system, our results show how, in
general, one can manipulate the populations of the different quantum states in
double well systems.
