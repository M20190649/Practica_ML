Shifts on a finite qubit string: A class of quantum baker's maps
We present two complementary ways in which Saraceno's symmetric version of
the quantum baker's map can be written as a shift map on a string of quantum
bits. One of these representations leads naturally to a family of quantizations
of the baker's map.
