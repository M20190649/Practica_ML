Mathematical and Physical Examination of the Locality Condition in
  Bell's Theorem
Using the Clauser-Horne model of Bell's theorem, the locality condition is
examined and it is shown the corresponding formulation is equivalent to a
factorization process consisting of three stages. The first stage is introduced
based on the conditional probability definition in classical theory of
probability and the other two stages are based on previously-known relations
named as outcome and parameter independence conditions.
