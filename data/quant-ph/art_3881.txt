Quantum Magic Bullets via Entanglement
Two particles that are entangled with respect to continuous variables such as
position and momentum exhibit a variety of nonclassical features. First,
measurement of one particle projects the other particle into the state that is
the complex conjugate of the state of the first particle, i.e., measurement of
one particle projects the other particle into the time-reversed state. Second,
continuous-variable entanglement can be used to implement a quantum "magic
bullet": when one particle manages to pass through a scattering potential, then
no matter how low the probability of this event, the second particle will also
pass through a related scattering potential with probability one. This
phenomenon is investigated in terms of the original EPR state, and experimental
realizations are suggested in terms of entangled photon states.
