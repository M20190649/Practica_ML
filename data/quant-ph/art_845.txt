Hypersensitivity to perturbation: An information-theoretical
  characterization of classical and quantum chaos
Hypersensitivity to perturbation is a criterion for chaos based on the
question of how much information about a perturbing environment is needed to
keep the entropy of a Hamiltonian system from increasing. In this paper we give
a brief overview of our work on hypersensitivity to perturbation in classical
and quantum systems.
