Quantum superluminal communication does not result in the causal loop
We show that the quantum superluminal communication based on the quantum
nonlocal influence, if exists, will not result in the causal loop, this
conclusion is essentially determined by the peculiarity of the quantum nonlocal
influence itself, according to which there must exist a preferred Lorentz frame
for consistently describing the quantum nonlocal process.
