Correlated Errors in Quantum Error Corrections
We show that errors are not generated correlatedly provided that quantum bits
do not directly interact with (or couple to) each other. Generally, this
no-qubits-interaction condition is assumed except for the case where two-qubit
gate operation is being performed. In particular, the no-qubits-interaction
condition is satisfied in the collective decoherence models. Thus, errors are
not correlated in the collective decoherence. Consequently, we can say that
current quantum error correcting codes which correct single-qubit-errors will
work in most cases including the collective decoherence.
