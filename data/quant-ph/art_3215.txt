Decoherence, Quantum Zeno Effect, and the Efficacy of Mental Effort
Recent theoretical and experimental papers support the prevailing opinion
that large warm systems will rapidly lose quantum coherence, and that classical
properties will emerge. This rapid loss of coherence would naturally be
expected to block any critical role for quantum theory in explaining the
interaction between our conscious experiences and the physical activities of
our brains. However, there is a quantum theory of mind in which the efficacy of
mental effort is not affected by decoherence effects. In this theory the
effects of mental action on brain activity is achieved by a Quantum Zeno Effect
that is not weakened by decoherence. The theory is based on a relativistic
version of von Neumann's quantum theory. It encompasses all the predictions of
Copenhagen quantum theory, which include all the validated predictions of
classical physical theory. In addition, it forges two-way dynamical links
between the physical and experiential aspects of nature. The theory has
significant explanatory power.
