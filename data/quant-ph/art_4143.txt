Separability Criterion for all bipartite Gaussian States
We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of Gaussian
states of bipartite systems of arbitrarily many modes. The condition provides
an operational criterion since it can be checked by simple computation.
Moreover, it allows us to find a pure product-state decomposition of any given
separable Gaussian state. Our criterion is independent of the one based on
partial transposition, and is strictly stronger.
