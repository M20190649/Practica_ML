Decoherence in trapped ions due to polarization of the residual
  background gas
We investigate the mechanism of damping and heating of trapped ions
associated with the polarization of the residual background gas induced by the
oscillating ions themselves. Reasoning by analogy with the physics of surface
electrons in liquid helium, we demonstrate that the decay of Rabi oscillations
observed in experiments on 9Be+ can be attributed to the polarization phenomena
investigated here. The measured sensitivity of the damping of Rabi oscillations
with respect to the vibrational quantum number of a trapped ion is also
predicted in our polarization model.
