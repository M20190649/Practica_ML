Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum
  Mechanics
Bell's theorem depends crucially on counterfactual reasoning, and is
mistakenly interpreted as ruling out a local explanation for the correlations
which can be observed between the results of measurements performed on
spatially-separated quantum systems. But in fact the Everett interpretation of
quantum mechanics, in the Heisenberg picture, provides an alternative local
explanation for such correlations. Measurement-type interactions lead, not to
many worlds but, rather, to many local copies of experimental systems and the
observers who measure their properties. Transformations of the
Heisenberg-picture operators corresponding to the properties of these systems
and observers, induced by measurement interactions, "label" each copy and
provide the mechanism which, e.g., ensures that each copy of one of the
observers in an EPRB or GHZM experiment will only interact with the "correct"
copy of the other observer(s). The conceptual problem of nonlocality is thus
replaced with a conceptual problem of proliferating labels, as correlated
systems and observers undergo measurement-type interactions with
newly-encountered objects and instruments; it is suggested that this problem
may be resolved by considering quantum field theory rather than the quantum
mechanics of particles.
