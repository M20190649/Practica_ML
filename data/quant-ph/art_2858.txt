Analogy between optimal spin estimation and interferometry
Scheme for optimal spin state estimation is considered in analogy with phase
detection in interferometry. Recently reported coherent measurements yielding
the average fidelity (N+1)/(N+2) for N particle system corresponds to the
standard limit of phase resolution 1/\sqrt{N}. It provides the bound for
incoherent measurements when each particle is detected separately and
information is used optimally. For specific states, improvement up to the value
1/N is possible in quantum theory. The best results are obtained combining
sequentially coherent measurements on fractional groups of particles.
