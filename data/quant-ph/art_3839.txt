Entanglement of Formation of an Arbitrary State of Two Rebits
We consider entanglement for quantum states defined in vector spaces over the
real numbers. Such real entanglement is different from entanglement in standard
quantum mechanics over the complex numbers. The differences provide insight
into the nature of entanglement in standard quantum theory. Wootters [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 80, 2245 (1998)] has given an explicit formula for the entanglement
of formation of two qubits in terms of what he calls the concurrence of the
joint density operator. We give a contrasting formula for the entanglement of
formation of an arbitrary state of two ``rebits,'' a rebit being a system whose
Hilbert space is a 2-dimensional real vector space.
