Fidelity for Multimode Thermal Squeezed States
In the theory of quantum transmission of information the concept of fidelity
plays a fundamental role. An important class of channels, which can be
experimentally realized in quantum optics, is that of Gaussian quantum
channels. In this work we present a general formula for fidelity in the case of
two arbitrary Gaussian states. From this formula one can get a previous result
(H. Scutaru, J. Phys. A: Mat. Gen {\bf 31}, 3659 (1998)), for the case of a
single mode; or, one can apply it to obtain a closed compact expression for
multimode thermal states.
