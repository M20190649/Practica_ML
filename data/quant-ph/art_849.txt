Ground State Laser Cooling Beyond the Lamb-Dicke Limit
We propose a laser cooling scheme that allows to cool a single atom confined
in a harmonic potential to the trap ground state $|0>$. The scheme assumes
strong confinement, where the oscillation frequency in the trap is larger than
the effective spontaneous decay width, but is not restricted to the Lamb-Dicke
limit, i.e. the size of the trap ground state can be larger than the optical
wavelength. This cooling scheme may be useful in the context of quantum
computations with ions and Bose-Einstein condensation.
