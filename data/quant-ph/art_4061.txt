Spatial evolution of short pulses under coherent population trapping
Spatial and temporal evolution is studied of two powerful short laser pulses
having different wavelengths and interacting with a dense three-level
Lambda-type optical medium under coherent population trapping. A general case
of unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of
the probe pulse and the coupling pulse $T_{1,2}$ ($T_2>T_1$) are assumed to be
shorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical
and numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger
equations and reduced wave equations in the adiabatic limit with the account of
the first non-adiabatic correction. The adiabaticity criterion is also
discussed with the account of the pulse propagation. The dynamics of
propagation is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the transition
oscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change
throughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance
can be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,
the probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during
propagation. The effect of localization of the atomic coherence has been
observed similar to the one predicted by Fleischhauer and Lukin (PRL, {\bf 84},
5094 (2000).
