Creating a low-dimensional quantum gas using dark states in an inelastic
  evanescent-wave mirror
We discuss an experimental scheme to create a low-dimensional gas of
ultracold atoms, based on inelastic bouncing on an evanescent-wave mirror.
Close to the turning point of the mirror, the atoms are transferred into an
optical dipole trap. This scheme can compress the phase-space density and can
ultimately yield an optically-driven atom laser. An important issue is the
suppression of photon scattering due to ``cross-talk'' between the mirror
potential and the trapping potential. We propose that for alkali atoms the
photon scattering rate can be suppressed by several orders of magnitude if the
atoms are decoupled from the evanescent-wave light. We discuss how such dark
states can be achieved by making use of circularly-polarized evanescent waves.
