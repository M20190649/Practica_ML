Elliptical Squeezed States and Rydberg Wave Packets
We present a theoretical construction for closest-to-classical wave packets
localized in both angular and radial coordinates and moving on a keplerian
orbit. The method produces a family of elliptical squeezed states for the
planar Coulomb problem that minimize appropriate uncertainty relations in
radial and angular coordinates. The time evolution of these states is studied
for orbits with different semimajor axes and eccentricities. The elliptical
squeezed states may be useful for a description of the motion of Rydberg wave
packets excited by short-pulsed lasers in the presence of external fields,
which experiments are attempting to produce. We outline an extension of the
method to include certain effects of quantum defects appearing in the
alkali-metal atoms used in experiments.
