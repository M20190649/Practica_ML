An extension of "Popper's experiment" can test interpretations of
  quantum mechanics
Karl Popper proposed a way to test whether a proposed relation of a
quantum-mechanical state to perceived reality in the Copenhagen interpretation
(CI) of quantum mechanics - namely that the state of a particle is merely an
expression of ``what is known'' about the system - is in agreement with all
experimental facts. A conceptual flaw in Popper's proposal is identified and an
improved version of his experiment (called ``Extension step 1'') - which fully
serves its original purpose - is suggested. The main purpose of this paper is
to suggest to perform this experiment. The results of this experiment predicted
under the alternative assumptions that the CI - together with the above
connection of the state function with reality - or the ``many-worlds''
interpretation (MWI) is correct are shown to be identical. Only after a further
modification (called ``Extension step 2'') - the use of an ion isolated from
the macroscopic environment as particle detector - the predictions using the
respective interpretations become qualitatively different.
