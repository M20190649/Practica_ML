Non-classical Photon Statistics For Two-mode Optical Fields
The non-classical property of subpoissonian photon statistics is extended
from one to two-mode electromagnetic fields, incorporating the physically
motivated property of invariance under passive unitary transformations.
Applications to squeezed coherent states, squeezed thermal states, and
superposition of coherent states are given. Dependences of extent of
non-classical behaviour on the independent squeezing parameters are graphically
displayed.
