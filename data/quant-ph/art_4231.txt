Robust control in the quantum domain
Recent progress in quantum physics has made it possible to perform
experiments in which individual quantum systems are monitored and manipulated
in real time. The advent of such new technical capabilities provides strong
motivation for the development of theoretical and experimental methodologies
for quantum feedback control. The availability of such methods would enable
radically new approaches to experimental physics in the quantum realm.
Likewise, the investigation of quantum feedback control will introduce crucial
new considerations to control theory, such as the uniquely quantum phenomena of
entanglement and measurement back-action. The extension of established analysis
techniques from control theory into the quantum domain may also provide new
insight into the dynamics of complex quantum systems. We anticipate that the
successful formulation of an input-output approach to the analysis and
reduction of large quantum systems could have very general applications in
non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and in the nascent field of
quantum information theory.
