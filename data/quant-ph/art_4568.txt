Supercatalysis
We show that entanglement-assisted transformations of bipartite entangled
states can be more efficient than catalysis [D. Jonathan and M. B. Plenio,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3566 (1999)}, i.e., given two incomparable bipartite
states not only can the transformation be enabled by performing collective
operations with an auxiliary entangled state, but the entanglement of the
auxiliary state itself can be enhanced. We refer to this phenomenon as
supercatalysis. We provide results on the properties of supercatalysis and its
relationship with catalysis. In particular, we obtain a useful necessary and
sufficient condition for catalysis, provide several sufficient conditions for
supercatalysis and study the extent to which entanglement of the auxiliary
state can be enhanced via supercatalysis.
