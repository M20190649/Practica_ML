Are violations to temporal Bell inequalities there when somebody looks?
The possibility of observing violations of temporal Bell inequalities,
originally proposed by Leggett as a mean of testing the quantum mechanical
delocalization of suitably chosen macroscopic bodies, is discussed by taking
into account the effect of the measurement process. A general criterion
quantifying this possibility is defined and shown not to be fulfilled by the
various experimental configurations proposed so far to test inequalities of
different forms.
