Preparation and measurement: two independent sources of uncertainty in
  quantum mechanics
In the Copenhagen interpretation the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is
interpreted as the mathematical expression of the concept of complementarity,
quantifying the mutual disturbance necessarily taking place in a simultaneous
or joint measurement of incompatible observables. This interpretation has
already been criticized by Ballentine a long time ago, and has recently been
challenged in an experimental way. These criticisms can be substantiated by
using the generalized formalism of positive operator-valued measures, from
which a new inequality can be derived, precisely illustrating the Copenhagen
concept of complementarity. The different roles of preparation and measurement
in creating uncertainty in quantum mechanics are discussed.
