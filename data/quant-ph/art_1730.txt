Quantum Turing Machines: Local Transition, Preparation, Measurement, and
  Halting
Foundations of the theory of quantum Turing machines are investigated. The
protocol for the preparation and the measurement of quantum Turing machines is
discussed. The local transition functions are characterized for fully general
quantum Turing machines. A new halting protocol is proposed without augmenting
the halting qubit and is shown to work without spoiling the computation.
