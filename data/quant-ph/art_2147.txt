Minimal conditions for local pure-state entanglement manipulation
We find a minimal set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a local procedure that converts a finite pure state into one of a
set of possible final states. This result provides a powerful method for
obtaining optimal local entanglement manipulation protocols for pure initial
states. As an example, we determine analytically the optimal distillable
entanglement for arbitrary finite pure states. We also construct an explicit
protocol achieving this bound.
