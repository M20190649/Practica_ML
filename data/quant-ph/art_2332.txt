Grover's search algorithm: An optical approach
The essential operations of a quantum computer can be accomplished using
solely optical elements, with different polarization or spatial modes
representing the individual qubits. We present a simple all-optical
implementation of Grover's algorithm for efficient searching, in which a
database of four elements is searched with a single query. By `compiling' the
actual setup, we have reduced the required number of optical elements from 24
to only 12. We discuss the extension to larger databases, and the limitations
of these techniques.
