Quantum separability, time reversal and canonical decompositions
We propose an interpretation of quantum separability based on a physical
principle: local time reversal. It immediately leads to a simple
characterization of separable quantum states that reproduces results known to
hold for binary composite systems and which thereby is complete for low
dimensions. We then describe a constructive algorithm for finding the canonical
decomposition of separable and non separable mixed states of dimensions 2x2 and
2x3.
