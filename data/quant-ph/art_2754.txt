Controlled quantum evolutions and transitions
We study the nonstationary solutions of Fokker-Planck equations associated to
either stationary or nonstationary quantum states. In particular we discuss the
stationary states of quantum systems with singular velocity fields. We
introduce a technique that allows to realize arbitrary evolutions ruled by
these equations, to account for controlled quantum transitions. The method is
illustrated by presenting the detailed treatment of the transition
probabilities and of the controlling time-dependent potentials associated to
the transitions between the stationary, the coherent, and the squeezed states
of the harmonic oscillator. Possible extensions to anharmonic systems and mixed
states are briefly discussed and assessed.
