A quantum computer based on electrons floating on liquid helium
Electrons on a helium surface form a quasi two-dimensional system which
displays the highest mobility reached in condensed matter physics. We propose
to use this system as a set of interacting quantum bits. We will briefly
describe the system and discuss how the qubits can be addressed and
manipulated, including interqubit excitation transfer. The working frequency of
the proposed quantum computer is ~1GHz. The relaxation rate can be at least 5
orders of magnitude smaller, for low temperatures.
