Information Flow in Entangled Quantum Systems
All information in quantum systems is, notwithstanding Bell's theorem,
localised. Measuring or otherwise interacting with a quantum system S has no
effect on distant systems from which S is dynamically isolated, even if they
are entangled with S. Using the Heisenberg picture to analyse quantum
information processing makes this locality explicit, and reveals that under
some circumstances (in particular, in Einstein-Podolski-Rosen experiments and
in quantum teleportation) quantum information is transmitted through
'classical' (i.e. decoherent) information channels.
