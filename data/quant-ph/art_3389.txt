Entanglement, thermalisation and stationarity: The computational
  foundations of quantum mechanics
'Tis said, to know others is to be learned, to know oneself, wise - I
demonstrate that it could be more fundamental than knowing the rest of nature,
by applying classical computational principles and engineering hindsight to
derive and explain quantum entanglement, state space formalism and the
statistical nature of quantum mechanics. I show that an entangled photon pair
is literally no more than a 1-bit hologram, that the quantum state formalism is
completely derivable from general considerations of representation of physical
information, and that both the probabilistic aspects of quantum theory and the
constancy of h are exactly predicted by the thermodynamics of representation,
without precluding a fundamental, relative difference in spatial scale between
non-colocated observers, leading to logical foundations of relativity and
cosmology that show the current thinking in that field to be simplistic and
erroneous.
