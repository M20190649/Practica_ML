Quantum key distribution in the Holevo limit
A theorem by Shannon and the Holevo theorem impose that the efficiency of any
protocol for quantum key distribution, $\cal E$, defined as the number of
secret (i.e., allowing eavesdropping detection) bits per transmitted bit plus
qubit, is ${\cal E} \le 1$. The problem addressed here is whether the limit
${\cal E} =1$ can be achieved. It is showed that it can be done by splitting
the secret bits between several qubits and forcing Eve to have only a
sequential access to the qubits, as proposed by Goldenberg and Vaidman. A
protocol with ${\cal E} =1$ based on polarized photons and in which Bob's state
discrimination can be implemented with linear optical elements is presented.
