Gisin Nonlocality of the Doebner-Goldin 2-Particle Equation
Gisin's argument against deterministic nonlinear Schroedinger equations is
shown to be valid for every (formally) nonlinearizable case of the general
Doebner-Goldin 2-particle equation in the following form:
  The time-dependence of the position probability distribution of a particle
`behind the moon' may be instantaneously changed by an arbitrarily small
instantaneous change of the potential `inside the laboratory'.
