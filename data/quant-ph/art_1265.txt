Dynamics of a Quantum Control-Not Gate for an Ensemble of Four-Spin
  Molecules at Room Temperature
We investigate numerically a single-pulse implementation of a quantum
Control-Not (CN) gate for an ensemble of Ising spin systems at room
temperature. For an ensemble of four-spin ``molecules'' we simulate the
time-evolution of the density matrix, for both digital and superpositional
initial conditions. Our numerical calculations confirm the feasibility of
implementation of quantum CN gate in this system at finite temperature, using
electromagnetic $\pi$-pulse.
