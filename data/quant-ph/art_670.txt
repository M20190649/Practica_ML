Quantum Interference of Polarized Electrons in the Presence of Magnetic
  Strings
This work analyzes the effects of shielding on the Aharonov-Bohm scattering
of electrons endowed with spin. The interaction of polarized electrons with
bare and shielded magnetic strings is studied with the aid of the Dirac
equation. It is found that the difference between the amplitudes for the
scattering by bare and shielded strings of incident wave packets of width
$\delta$ and impact parameter $d$ is proportional to $\exp(-d^2/2\delta^2)$.
