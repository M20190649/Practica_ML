The analysis of Hardy's experiment revisited
Cohen and Hiley [Phys. Rev. A 52, 76 (1995)] have criticized the analysis of
Hardy's gedanken experiment according to which the contradiction with quantum
theory in Hardy's experiment arises due the failure of the "product rule" for
the elements of reality of pre- and post-selected systems. It is argued that
the criticism of Cohen and Hiley is not sound.
