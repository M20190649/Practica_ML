Antiparticle in Light of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox and Klein
  Paradox
The original version of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and the Klein
paradox of Klein-Gordon (KG) equation are discussed to show the necessity of
existence of antiparticle with its wavefunction being fixed unambiguously. No
concept of "hole" is needed.
