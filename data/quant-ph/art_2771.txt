Quantum CPU and Quantum Algorithm
Making use of an universal quantum network -- QCPU proposed by
me\upcite{My1}, it is obtained that the whole quantum network which can
implement some the known quantum algorithms including Deutsch algorithm,
quantum Fourier transformation, Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm.
