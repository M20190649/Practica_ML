Time Dependence in Quantum Mechanics
It is shown that the time-dependent equations (Schr\"odinger and Dirac) for a
quantum system can be always derived from the time-independent equation for the
larger object of the system interacting with its environment, in the limit that
the dynamical variables of the environment can be treated semiclassically. The
time which describes the quantum evolution is then provided parametrically by
the classical evolution of the environment variables. The method used is a
generalization of that known for a long time in the field of ion-atom
collisions, where it appears as a transition from the full quantum mechanical
{\it perturbed stationary states} to the {impact parameter} method in which the
projectile ion beam is treated classically.
