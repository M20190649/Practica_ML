Time-Symmetrized Counterfactuals in Quantum Theory
Counterfactuals in quantum theory are briefly reviewed and it is argued that
they are very different from counterfactuals considered in the general
philosophical literature. The issue of time symmetry of quantum counterfactuals
is considered and a novel time-symmetric definition of quantum counterfactuals
is proposed. This definition is applied for analyzing several controversies
related to quantum counterfactuals.
