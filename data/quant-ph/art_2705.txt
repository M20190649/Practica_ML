Backlund-type superposition and free particle n-susy partners
The higher order susy partners of Schroedinger Hamiltonians can be explicitly
constructed by iterating a nonlinear difference algorithm coinciding with the
Backlund superposition principle used in soliton theory. As an example, it is
applied in the construction of new higher order susy partners of the free
particle potential, which can be used as a handy tool in soliton theory.
