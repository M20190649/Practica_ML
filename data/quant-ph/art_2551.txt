Proposal for teleportation of an atomic state via cavity decay
We show how the state of an atom trapped in a cavity can be teleported to a
second atom trapped in a distant cavity simply by detecting photon decays from
the cavities. This is a rare example of a decay mechanism playing a
constructive role in quantum information processing. The scheme is
comparatively easy to implement, requiring only the ability to trap a single
three level atom in a cavity.
