Quantum Anti-Zeno Effect
We demonstrate that near threshold decay processes may be accelerated by
repeated measurements. Examples include near threshold photodetachment of an
electron from a negative ion, and spontaneous emission in a cavity close to the
cutoff frequency, or in a photon band gap material.
