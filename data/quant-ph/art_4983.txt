Conditional generation of N-photon entangled states of light
We propose a scheme for conditional generation of two-mode N-photon
path-entangled states of traveling light field. These states may find
applications in quantum optical lithography and they may be used to improve the
sensitivity of interferometric measurements. Our method requires only
single-photon sources, linear optics (beam splitters and phase shifters), and
photodetectors with single photon sensitivity.
