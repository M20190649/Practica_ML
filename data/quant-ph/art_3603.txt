Space-Time Structure as Hidden Variable
EPR correlations exist and can be observed independently of any a priori
given frame of reference. We can even construct a frame of reference that is
based on these correlations. This observation-based frame of reference is
equivalent to the customary a priori given frame of reference of the laboratory
when describing real EPR experiments. J.S. Bell has argued that local hidden
parameter theories that reproduce the predictions of Quantum Mechanics cannot
exist, but the counterfactual reasoning leading to Bell's conclusion is
physically meaningless if the frame of reference that is based on
EPR-correlations is accepted as the backdrop for EPR-type experiments. The
refutal of Bell's proof opens up for the construction of a viable hidden
parameter theory. A model of a spin h/2 particle in terms of a non-flat metric
of space-time is shown to be able to reproduce the predictions of quantum
mechanics in the Bohm-Aharonov version of the EPR experiment, without
introducing non-locality.
