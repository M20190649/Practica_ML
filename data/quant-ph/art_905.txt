Generalized coherent states are unique Bell states of quantum systems
  with Lie group symmetries
We consider quantum systems, whose dynamical symmetry groups are semisimple
Lie groups, which can be split or decay into two subsystems of the same
symmetry. We prove that the only states of such a system that factorize upon
splitting are the generalized coherent states. Since Bell's inequality is never
violated by the direct product state, when the system prepared in the
generalized coherent state is split, no quantum correlations are created.
Therefore, the generalized coherent states are the unique Bell states, i.e.,
the pure quantum states preserving the fundamental classical property of
satisfying Bell's inequality upon splitting.
