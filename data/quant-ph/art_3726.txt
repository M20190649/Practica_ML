Secure quantum key distribution using squeezed states
We prove the security of a quantum key distribution scheme based on
transmission of squeezed quantum states of a harmonic oscillator. Our proof
employs quantum error-correcting codes that encode a finite-dimensional quantum
system in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of an oscillator, and protect
against errors that shift the canonical variables p and q. If the noise in the
quantum channel is weak, squeezing signal states by 2.51 dB (a squeeze factor
e^r=1.34) is sufficient in principle to ensure the security of a protocol that
is suitably enhanced by classical error correction and privacy amplification.
Secure key distribution can be achieved over distances comparable to the
attenuation length of the quantum channel.
