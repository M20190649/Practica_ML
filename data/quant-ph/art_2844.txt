A Practical Method of Constructing Quantum Combinational Logic Circuits
We describe a practical method of constructing quantum combinational logic
circuits with basic quantum logic gates such as NOT and general $n$-bit Toffoli
gates. This method is useful to find the quantum circuits for evaluating logic
functions in the form most appropriate for implementation on a given quantum
computer. The rules to get the most efficient circuit are utilized best with
the aid of a Karnaugh map. It is explained which rules of using a Karnaugh map
are changed due to the difference between the quantum and classical logic
circuits.
