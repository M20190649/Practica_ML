Generic Bohmian Trajectories of an Isolated Particle
The generic Bohmian trajectories are calculated for an isolated particle in
an approximate energy eigenstate, for an arbitrary one-dimensional potential
well. It is shown, that the necessary and sufficient condition for there to be
a negligible probability of the trajectory deviating significantly from the
classical trajectory at any stage in the motion is, that the state be a
narrowly localised wave packet. The properties of the Bohmian trajectories are
discussed in relationship to the theory of retrodictively optimal simultaneous
measurements of position and momentum which was presented in several previous
papers. It is shown that the Bohmian velocity at x is the expectation value of
the velocity which would be observed at x, if one were to make a retrodictively
optimal simultaneous measurement of x and p, in the limit as the error in the
measurement of x tends to zero. This explains the tendency of the Bohmian
particle to behave in a highly non-classical manner. It also explains why the
trajectories in the interpretation recently proposed by Garcia de Polavieja
tend to be much more nearly classical in the limit of large quantum number. The
implications for other trajectory interpretations are considered.
