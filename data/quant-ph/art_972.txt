Dissipative dynamics in a quantum register
A model for a quantum register dissipatively coupled with a bosonic thermal
bath is studied. The register consists of $N$ qubits (i.e. spin ${1/2}$ degrees
of freedom), the bath is described by $N_b$ bosonic modes. The register-bath
coupling is chosen in such a way that the total number of excitations is
conserved. The Hilbert space splits allowing the study of the dynamics
separately in each sector. Assuming that the coupling with the bath is the same
for all qubits, the excitation sectors have a further decomposition according
the irreducible representations of the $su(2)$ spin algebra. The stability
against environment-generated noise of the information encoded in a quantum
state of the register depends on its $su(2)$ symmetry content. At zero
temperature we find that states belonging to the vacuum symmetry sector have
for long time vanishing fidelity, whereas each lowest spin vector is decoupled
from the bath and therefore is decoherence free. Numerical results are shown in
the one-excitation space in the case qubit-dependent bath-system coupling.
