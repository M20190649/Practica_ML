The non-local content of quantum operations
We show that quantum operations on multi-particle systems have a non-local
content; this mirrors the non-local content of quantum states. We introduce a
general framework for discussing the non-local content of quantum operations,
and give a number of examples. Quantitative relations between quantum actions
and the entanglement and classical communication resources needed to implement
these actions are also described. We also show how entanglement can catalyse
classical communication from a quantum action.
