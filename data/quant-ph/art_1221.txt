Linear quantum trajectories: Applications to continuous projection
  measurements
We present a method for obtaining evolution operators for linear quantum
trajectories. We apply this to a number of physical examples of varying
mathematical complexity, in which the quantum trajectories describe the
continuous projection measurement of physical observables. Using this method we
calculate the average conditional uncertainty for the measured observables,
being a central quantity of interest in these measurement processes.
