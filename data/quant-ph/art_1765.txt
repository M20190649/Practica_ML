Ambiguities of arrival-time distributions in quantum theory
We consider the definition that might be given to the time at which a
particle arrives at a given place, both in standard quantum theory and also in
Bohmian mechanics. We discuss an ambiguity that arises in the standard theory
in three, but not in one, spatial dimension.
