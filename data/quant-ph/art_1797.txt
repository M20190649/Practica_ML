Multi-particle entanglement of hot trapped ions
We propose an efficient method to produce multi-particle entangled states of
ions in an ion trap for which a wide range of interesting effects and
applications have been suggested. Our preparation scheme exploits the
collective vibrational motion of the ions, but it works in such a way that this
motion need not be fully controlled in the experiment. The ions may, e.g., be
in thermal motion and exchange mechanical energy with a surrounding heat bath
without detrimental effects on the internal state preparation. Our scheme does
not require access to the individual ions in the trap.
