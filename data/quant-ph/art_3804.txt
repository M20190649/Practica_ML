Interpreting the time of decay measurement: phenomenological
  significance of the Bohm model
We point out that the spreading of wave packets could be significant in
affecting the analysis of experiments involving the measurement of time of
decay. In particular, we discuss a hitherto unexplored application of the Bohm
model in properly taking into account the nontrivial effect of wave packet
spreading in the CP violation experiment.
