Temporal behavior and quantum Zeno time of an excited state of the
  hydrogen atom
The quantum "Zeno" time of the 2P-1S transition of the hydrogen atom is
computed and found to be approximately 3.59 10^{-15}s (the lifetime is
approximately 1.595 10^{-9}s). The temporal behavior of this system is analyzed
in a purely quantum field theoretical framework and is compared to the
exponential decay law.
