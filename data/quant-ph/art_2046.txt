On the parametric approximation in quantum optics
We perform the exact numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonians that
describe both degenerate and nondegenerate parametric amplifiers, by exploiting
the conservation laws pertaining each device. We clarify the conditions under
which the parametric approximation holds, showing that the most relevant
requirement is the coherence of the pump after the interaction, rather than its
undepletion.
