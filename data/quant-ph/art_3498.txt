Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formulation of a Dirac quantized constrained system
An extension of the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formulation of quantum mechanics
suitable for a Dirac quantized constrained system is proposed. In this
formulation, quantum observables are described by equivalent classes of Weyl
symbols. The Weyl product of these equivalent classes is defined. The new Moyal
bracket is shown to be compatible with the Dirac bracket for constrained
systems.
