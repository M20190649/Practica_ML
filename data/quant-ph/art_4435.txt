Ultrahigh reflection from a medium with ultraslow group velocity
We show that an incident wavepacket at the boundary to a medium with
extremely slow group velocity, experiences enhanced reflection and a
substantial spatial and temporal distortion of the transmitted wave packet. In
the limit of vanishing group velocity, light cannot be transferred into the
medium due to its perfect reflectivity.
