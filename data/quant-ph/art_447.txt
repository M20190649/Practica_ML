Displacement-Operator Squeezed States. I. Time-Dependent Systems Having
  Isomorphic Symmetry Algebras
In this paper we use the Lie algebra of space-time symmetries to construct
states which are solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for
systems with potentials $V(x,\tau)=g^{(2)}(\tau)x^2+g^{(1)}(\tau)x
+g^{(0)}(\tau)$. We describe a set of number-operator eigenstates states,
$\{\Psi_n(x,\tau)\}$, that form a complete set of states but which, however,
are usually not energy eigenstates. From the extremal state,
  $\Psi_0$, and a displacement squeeze operator derived using the Lie
symmetries, we construct squeezed states and compute expectation values for
position and momentum as a function of time, $\tau$. We prove a general
expression for the uncertainty relation for position and momentum in terms of
the squeezing parameters. Specific examples, all corresponding to choices of
$V(x,\tau)$ and having isomorphic Lie algebras, will be dealt with in the
following paper (II).
