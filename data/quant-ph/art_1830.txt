Cavity Loss Induced Generation of Entangled Atoms
We discuss the generation of entangled states of two two-level atoms inside
an optical resonator. When the cavity decay is continuously monitored, the
absence of photon-counts is associated with the presence of an atomic entangled
state. In addition to being conceptually simple, this scheme could be
demonstrated with presently available technology. We describe how such a state
is generated through conditional dynamics, using quantum jump methods,
including both cavity damping and spontaneous emission decay, and evaluate the
fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement of the generated state compared
with the target entangled state.
