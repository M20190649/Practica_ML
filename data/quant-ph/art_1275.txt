Quantum mechanical retrocausation? Call for nonlocal causal models!
A new possible version of multisimultaneous causality is proposed, and real
experiments allowing us to decide between this view and quantum mechanical
retrocausation are further discussed. The interest of testing quantum mechanics
against as many nonlocal causal models as possible is stressed.
