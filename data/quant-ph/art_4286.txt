Physical sectors of the confluent hypergeometric functions space
A relaxed factorization is used to obtain many of the properties obeyed by
the confluent hypergeometric functions. Their implications on the analytical
solutions of some interesting physical problems are also studied. It is quite
remarkable that, although these properties appear frequently in solving the
Schroedinger equation, it has been not clear the role they play in describing
the physical systems. The main objective of this communication is precisely to
throw some light on the subject.
