Nested quantum search and NP-complete problems
A quantum algorithm is known that solves an unstructured search problem in a
number of iterations of order $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the
search space, whereas any classical algorithm necessarily scales as $O(d)$. It
is shown here that an improved quantum search algorithm can be devised that
exploits the structure of a tree search problem by nesting this standard search
algorithm. The number of iterations required to find the solution of an average
instance of a constraint satisfaction problem scales as $\sqrt{d^\alpha}$, with
a constant $\alpha<1$ depending on the nesting depth and the problem
considered. When applying a single nesting level to a problem with constraints
of size 2 such as the graph coloring problem, this constant $\alpha$ is
estimated to be around 0.62 for average instances of maximum difficulty. This
corresponds to a square-root speedup over a classical nested search algorithm,
of which our presented algorithm is the quantum counterpart.
