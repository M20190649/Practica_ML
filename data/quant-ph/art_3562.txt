The interference of the nonclassical light pulse with a coherent one and
  the sub-Poissonian statistics formation
Using the theoretical model of the optical beam-splitter, the interference of
the self-phase modulated ultrashort light pulse (SPM-USP) with the coherent one
is investigated. It is found that, the choice of the coefficient of
transmission of the beam-splitter allows one to get the spectra of quadrature
fluctuations with forms of interest to us. It is shown that the choice of the
geometrical phase gives one the control of the position of the ellipse of
squeezing in the quadrature space XY. The extended Mandel parameter is
introduced and the photon statistics is scanned at all frequencies. It is
established that the sub- and super-Poissonian statistics formation can be
determined by the choice of the nonlinear phase addition and initial linear
phase shift between pulses. It is also shown that the self-phase modulation
(SPM) leads to the additional modulation of total photon number at the outputs
of the beam-splitter.
