States interpolating between number and coherent states and their
  interaction with atomic systems
Using the eigenvalue definition of binomial states we construct new
intermediate number-coherent states which reduce to number and coherent states
in two different limits. We reveal the connection of these intermediate states
with photon-added coherent states and investigate their non-classical
properties and quasi-probability distributions in detail. It is of interest to
note that these new states, which interpolate between coherent states and
number states, neither of which exhibit squeezing, are nevertheless squeezed
states. A scheme to produce these states is proposed. We also study the
interaction of these states with atomic systems in the framework of the
two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model, and describe the response of the atomic
system as it varies between the pure Rabi oscillation and the collapse-revival
mode and investigate field observables such as photon number distribution,
entropy and the Q-function.
