A study of quantum decoherence in a system with Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser
  tori
We present an experimental and numerical study of the effects of decoherence
on a quantum system whose classical analogue has Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser (KAM)
tori in its phase space. Atoms are prepared in a caesium magneto-optical trap
at temperatures and densities which necessitate a quantum description. This
real quantum system is coupled to the environment via spontaneous emission. The
degree of coupling is varied and the effects of this coupling on the quantum
coherence of the system are studied. When the classical diffusion through a
partially broken torus is < hbar, diffusion of quantum particles is inhibited.
We find that increasing decoherence via spontaneous emission increases the
transport of quantum particles through the boundary.
