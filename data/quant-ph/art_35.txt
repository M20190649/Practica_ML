Quantum Electrodynamics at Large Distances III: Verification of Pole
  Factorization and the Correspondence Principle
In two companion papers it was shown how to separate out from a scattering
function in quantum electrodynamics a distinguished part that meets the
correspondence-principle and pole-factorization requirements. The integrals
that define the terms of the remainder are here shown to have singularities on
the pertinent Landau singularity surface that are weaker than those of the
distinguished part. These remainder terms therefore vanish, relative to the
distinguished term, in the appropriate macroscopic limits. This shows, in each
order of the perturbative expansion, that quantum electrodynamics does indeed
satisfy the pole-factorization and correspondence-principle requirements in the
case treated here. It also demonstrates the efficacy of the computational
techniques developed here to calculate the consequences of the principles of
quantum electrodynamics in the macroscopic and mesoscopic regimes.
