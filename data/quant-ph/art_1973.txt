Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-at-a-Distance
This is a review of ``Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-at-a-Distance:
Quantum Mechanical Studies for Abner Shimony, Volume Two''. The Festschrift
contains contributions from some of the most eminent workers in foundations of
quantum mechanics such as Aharonov, Anandan, Busch, d'Espagnat, Ghirardi,
Hardy, Howard, Mermin, Mittelstaedt, Peres, Popescu, Primas, Redhead, Rimini,
Rohrlich, Stachel, Stein, Vaidman, and Weber (along with a few others). In this
review of the Festschrift I have tried to give an overview (from my own
perspective) of the current state of the foundations of quantum mechanics --
especially with regard to the interpretational problems infesting the theory,
along with comments on several other significant lines of investigation.
