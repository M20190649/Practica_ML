Decoherence and Programmable Quantum Computation
An examination of the concept of using classical degrees of freedom to drive
the evolution of quantum computers is given. Specifically, when externally
generated, coherent states of the electromagnetic field are used to drive
transitions within the qubit system, a decoherence results due to the back
reaction from the qubits onto the quantum field. We derive an expression for
the decoherence rate for two cases, that of the single-qubit Walsh-Hadamard
transform, and for an implementation of the controlled-NOT gate. We examine the
impact of this decoherence mechanism on Grover's search algorithm, and on the
proposals for use of error-correcting codes in quantum computation.
