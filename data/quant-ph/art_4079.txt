Quantum Theory Cannot Forbid Superluminal Signaling
This note analyzed the angle-distribution of the probabilities of two-photon
states come out of a single-photon's stimulated emission amplification, show
that one can exploit EPR photon pairs combined with stimulated emission to
realize superluminal signaling.
