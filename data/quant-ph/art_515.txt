Correcting Quantum Errors In Higher Spin Systems
I consider the theory of quantum error correcting code (QECC) where each
quantum particle has more than two possible eigenstates. In this higher spin
system, I report an explicit QECC that is related to the symmetry group ${\Bbb
Z}_2^{\otimes (N-1)} \otimes S_N$. This QECC, which generalizes Shor's simple
majority vote code, is able to correct errors arising from exactly one quantum
particle. I also provide a simple encoding algorithm.
