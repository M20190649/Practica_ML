Curve crossing in linear potential grids: the quasidegeneracy
  approximation
The quasidegeneracy approximation [V. A. Yurovsky, A. Ben-Reuven, P. S.
Julienne, and Y. B. Band, J. Phys. B {\bf 32}, 1845 (1999)] is used here to
evaluate transition amplitudes for the problem of curve crossing in linear
potential grids involving two sets of parallel potentials. The approximation
describes phenomena, such as counterintuitive transitions and saturation
(incomplete population transfer), not predictable by the assumption of
independent crossings. Also, a new kind of oscillations due to quantum
interference (different from the well-known St\"uckelberg oscillations) is
disclosed, and its nature discussed. The approximation can find applications in
many fields of physics, where multistate curve crossing problems occur.
