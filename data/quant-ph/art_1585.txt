Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm as a test of quantum computation
A redundancy in the existing Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm is removed and a
refined algorithm, which reduces the size of the register and simplifies the
function evaluation, is proposed. The refined version allows a simpler analysis
of the use of entanglement between the qubits in the algorithm and provides
criteria for deciding when the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm constitutes a meaningful
test of quantum computation.
