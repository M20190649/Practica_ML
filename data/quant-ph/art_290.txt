Quantum computing Hamiltonian cycles
An algorithm for quantum computing Hamiltonian cycles of simple, cubic,
bipartite graphs is discussed. It is shown that it is possible to evolve a
quantum computer into an entanglement of states which map onto the set of all
possible paths originating from a chosen vertex, and furthermore to
subsequently project out all states not corresponding to Hamiltonian cycles.
