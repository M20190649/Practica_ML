A fresh look at 3D microwave ionization curves of hydrogen Rydberg atoms
Analytical arguments and numerical simulations suggest that the shapes of 3D
microwave ionization curves measured by Koch and collaborators (see P. M. Koch
and K. A. H. van Leeuwen, Phys. Rep. {\bf 255}, 289 (1995)) depend only weakly
on the angular momentum of the atoms in the initial microcanonical ensemble,
but strongly on the principal quantum number and the magnetic quantum number.
Based on this insight, coupled with the computational power of a high-end
60-node Beowulf PC cluster, we present the first 3D quantum calculations of
microwave ionization curves in the experimentally relevant parameter regime.
