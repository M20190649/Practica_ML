Uncertainty rescued: Bohr's complementarity for composite systems
Generalized uncertainty relations may depend not only on the commutator
relation of two observables considered, but also on mutual correlations, in
particular, on entanglement. The equivalence between the uncertainty relation
and Bohr's complementarity thus holds in a much broader sense than anticipated.
