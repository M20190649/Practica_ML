Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory III: Epistemology
The two previous papers developed quantum mechanical formalism from classical
mechanics and two additional postulates. In the first paper it was also shown
that the uncertainty relations possess no ontological validity and only reflect
the formalism's limitations. In this paper, a Realist Interpretation of quantum
mechanics based on these results is elaborated and compared to the Copenhagen
Interpretation. We demonstrate that von Neumann's proof of the impossibility of
a hidden variable theory is not correct, independently of Bell's argumentation.
A local hidden variable theory is found for non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
which is nothing else than newtonian mechanics itself. We prove that Bell's
theorem does not imply in a non-locality of quantum mechanics, and also
demonstrate that Bohm's theory cannot be considered a true hidden variable
theory.
