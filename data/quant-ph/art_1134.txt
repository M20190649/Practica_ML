Revivals of Rydberg Wave Packets
We examine the revival structure of Rydberg wave packets. These wave packets
exhibit initial classical periodic motion followed by a sequence of collapse,
fractional/full revivals, and fractional/full superrevivals. The effects of
quantum defects on wave packets in alkali-metal atoms and a squeezed-state
description of the initial wave packets are also described. We then examine the
revival structure of Rydberg wave packets in the presence of an external
electric field, i.e., the revival structure of Stark wave packets. These wave
packets have energies that depend on two quantum numbers and exhibit new types
of interference behavior.
