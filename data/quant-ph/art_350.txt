Quantum Electronic Devices Based on Metal-Dielectric Transition in
  Low-Dimensional Quantum Structures
Two types of optically manipulated quantum electronic devices are considered:
a quantum dot and a finite periodic molecular chain, with the period doubled
under resonance optical excitation. The stability of the working regimes of the
devices in large scale of temperatures is discussed. Some motivation in favor
of the molecular chain is suggested. A class of materials, which can be used
for producing this device is discussed.
