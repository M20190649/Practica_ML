A two-slit experiment which distinguishes between standard and Bohmian
  quantum mechanics
In this investigation, we have suggested a special two-slit experiment which
can distinguish between the standard and the Bohmian quantum mechanics. At the
first step, we have shown that observable individual predictions obtained from
these two theories are inconsistent for a special case. But, at the ensemble
level, they are consistent as was expected. Then, as another special case and
using selective detection, it is shown that an observable disagreement between
the two theories can exist at the ensemble level of particles. This can
encourage new efforts for finding other inconsistencies between the two
theories, theoretically and experimentally.
