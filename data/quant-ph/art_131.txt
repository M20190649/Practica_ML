The unitary transformation of the path-integral measure
The aim of the article is to show how a coordinate transformation can be
applied to the path-integral formalism. For this purpose the unitary definition
of the quantum measure, which guarantees the conservation of total probability,
is offered. As the examples, the phase space transformation to the canonically
conjugate pare $(energy, time)$ and the transformation to the cylindrical
coordinates are shown. The transformations of the path-integral measure looks
classically but they can not be deduced from naive transformations of quantum
trajectories.
