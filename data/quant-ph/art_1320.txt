Second-quantization of open systems using quasinormal modes
The second-quantization of a scalar field in an open cavity is formulated,
from first principles, in terms of the quasinormal modes (QNMs), which are the
eigensolutions of the evolution equation that decay exponentially in time as
energy leaks to the outside. This formulation provides a description involving
the cavity degrees of freedom only, with the outside acting as a (thermal or
driven) source. Thermal correlation functions and cavity Feynman propagators
are thus expressed in terms of the QNMs, labeled by a discrete index rather
than a continuous momentum. Single-resonance domination of the density of
states and the spontaneous decay rate is then given a proper foundation. This
is a first essential step towards the application of QNMs to cavity QED
phenomena, to be reported elsewhere.
