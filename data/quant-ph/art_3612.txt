Quantum Recurrences: Probe to study Quantum Chaos
We study the phase space of periodically modulated gravitational cavity by
means of quantum recurrence phenomena. We report that the quantum recurrences
serve as a tool to connect phase space of the driven system with spectrum in
quantum domain. With the help of quantum recurrences we investigate the
quasi-energy spectrum of the system for a certain fixed modulation strength. In
addition, we study transition of spectrum from discrete to continuum as a
function of modulation strength.
