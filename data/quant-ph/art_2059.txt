Quantum gates by coupled asymmetric quantum dots and controlled-NOT-gate
  operation
A quantum computer based on an asymmetric coupled dot system has been
proposed and shown to operate as the controlled-NOT-gate. The basic idea is (1)
the electron is localized in one of the asymmetric coupled dots. (2)The
electron transfer takes place from one dot to the other when the energy-levels
of the coupled dots are set close. (3)The Coulomb interaction between the
coupled dots mutually affects the energy levels of the other coupled dots. The
decoherence time of the quantum computation and the measurement time are
estimated. The proposed system can be realized by developing the technology of
the single-electron memory using Si nanocrystals and the direct combination of
the quantum circuit and the conventional circuit is possible.
