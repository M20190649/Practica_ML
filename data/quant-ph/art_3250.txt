Quantum communication between atomic ensembles using coherent light
Protocols for quantum communication between massive particles, such as atoms,
are usually based on transmitting nonclassical light, and/or super-high finesse
optical cavities are normally needed to enhance interaction between atoms and
photons. We demonstrate a surprising result: an unknown quantum state can be
teleported from one free-space atomic ensemble to the other by transmitting
only coherent light. No non-classical light and no cavities are needed in the
scheme, which greatly simplifies its experimental implementation.
