Vibrational Superposition States Without Rotating Wave Approximation
We propose a scheme to generate superpositions of coherent states for the
vibrational motion of a laser cooled trapped-ion. It is based on the
interaction with a standing wave making use of the counter-rotating terms, i.e.
not applying the rotating wave approximation. We also show that the same scheme
can be exploited for quantum state measurement, i.e. with the same scheme
non-classical states may be reconstructed
