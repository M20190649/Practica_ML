Incoherent scattering of light by a Bose--Einstein condensate of
  interacting atoms
We demonstrate that incoherent photon scattering by a Bose-Einstein
condensate of non-ideal atomic gas is enhanced due to bosonic stimulation of
spontaneous emission, similarly to coherent scattering in forward direction.
Necessary initial population of non-condensate states is provided by quantum
depletion of a condensate caused by interatomic repulsion.
