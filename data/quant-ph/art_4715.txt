Generation of arbitrary two dimensional motional state of a trapped ion
We present a scheme to generate an arbitrary two-dimensional quantum state of
motion of a trapped ion. This proposal is based on a sequence of laser pulses,
which are tuned appropriately to control transitions on the sidebands of two
modes of vibration. Not more than $(M+1)(N+1)$ laser pulses are needed to
generate a pure state with upper phonon number $M$ and $N$ in the $x$ and $y$
direction respectively.
