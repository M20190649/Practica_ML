Optimal local implementation of non-local quantum gates
We investigate the minimal resources that are required in the local
implementation of non-local quantum gates in a distributed quantum computer.
Both classical communication requirements and entanglement consumption are
investigated. We present general statements on the minimal resource
requirements and present optimal procedures for a number of important gates,
including CNOT and Toffoli gates. We show that one bit of classical
communication in each direction is both necessary and sufficient for the
non-local implementation of the quantum CNOT, while in general two bits in each
direction is required for the implementation of a general two bit quantum gate.
In particular, the state-swapper requires this maximum classical communication
overhead. Extensions of these ideas to multi-party gates are presented.
