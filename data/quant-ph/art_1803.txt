Cavity-induced coherence effects in spontaneous emission from
  pre-Selection of polarization
Spontaneous emission can create coherences in a multilevel atom having close
lying levels, subject to the condition that the atomic dipole matrix elements
are non-orthogonal. This condition is rarely met in atomic systems. We report
the possibility of bypassing this condition and thereby creating coherences by
letting the atom with orthogonal dipoles to interact with the vacuum of a
pre-selected polarized cavity mode rather than the free space vacuum. We derive
a master equation for the reduced density operator of a model four level atomic
system, and obtain its analytical solution to describe the interference
effects. We report the quantum beat structure in the populations.
