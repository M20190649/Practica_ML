Probabilistic exact cloning and probabilistic no-signalling
We show that non-local resources cannot be used for probabilistic signalling
even if one can produce exact clones with the help of a probabilistic quantum
cloning machine (PQCM). We show that PQCM cannot help to distinguish two
statistical mixtures at a remote location. Thus quantum theory rules out the
possibility of sending superluminal signals not only deterministically but also
probabilistically. We give a bound on the success probability of producing
multiple clones in an entangled system.
