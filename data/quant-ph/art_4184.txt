Entanglement in a two-identical-particle system
The definition of entanglement in identical-particle system is introduced.
The separability criterion in two-identical particle system is given. The
physical meaning of the definition is analysed. Applications to two-boson and
two-fermion systems are made. It is found new entanglement and correlation
phenomena in identical-boson systems exist, and they may have applications in
the field of quantum information.
