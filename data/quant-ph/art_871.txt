Dynamical Manipulation for spin-1/2 Systems
By means of the inverse techniques we analyse the evolution of purely
spin-1/2 systems in homogeneous magnetic fields as well as the generation of
exact solutions. Some ``evolution loops'', dynamical processes for which any
state evolves cyclically, are presented, and their corresponding geometric
phases are evaluated
