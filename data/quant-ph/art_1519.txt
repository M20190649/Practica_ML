Convex probability domain of generalized quantum measurements
Generalized quantum measurements with N distinct outcomes are used for
determining the density matrix, of order d, of an ensemble of quantum systems.
The resulting probabilities are represented by a point in an N-dimensional
space. It is shown that this point lies in a convex domain having at most d^2-1
dimensions.
