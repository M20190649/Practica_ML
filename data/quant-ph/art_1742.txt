Quantile Motion and Tunneling
The concepts of quantile position, trajectory, and velocity are defined. For
a tunneling quantum mechanical wave packet, it is proved that its quantile
position always stays behind that of a free wave packet with the same initial
parameters. In quantum mechanics the quantile trajectories are mathematically
identical to Bohm's trajectories. A generalization to three dimensions is
given.
