Long-distance Bell-type tests using energy-time entangled photons
Long-distance Bell-type experiments are presented. The different experimental
challenges and their solutions in order to maintain the strong quantum
correlations between energy-time entangled photons over more than 10 km are
reported and the results analyzed from the point of view of tests of
fundamental physics as well as from the more applied side of quantum
communication, specially quantum key distribution. Tests using more than one
analyzer on each side are also presented.
