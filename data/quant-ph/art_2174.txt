Internal Time Superoperator for Quantum Systems with Diagonal
  Singularity
We generalize the concepts of Internal Time Superoperator, its associated non
unitary similarity transformations and Liapounov variables, to quantum systems
with diagonal singularity, and we give a constructive proof of the existence of
these superoperators for systems with purely diagonal Hamiltonian having
uniform absolutely continuous spectrum on the interval from zero to infinity.
