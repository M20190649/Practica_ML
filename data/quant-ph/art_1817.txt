Differential cross section for Aharonov--Bohm effect with non standard
  boundary conditions
A basic analysis is provided for the differential cross section
characterizing Aharonov--Bohm effect with non standard (non regular) boundary
conditions imposed on a wave function at the potential barrier. If compared
with the standard case two new features can occur: a violation of rotational
symmetry and a more significant backward scattering.
