Wavelets as basis functions in canonical quantization
Canonical quantization of electromagnetic field is traditionally done using
plane waves. It is possible to formulate the quantization using other complete
set of basis functions. Wavelets are a special kind of functions which are
localized in real as well as in Fourier space. In this paper we show how
wavelets can be used as basis functions in canonical quantization. A countable
set of mode functions are obtained. The general formalism of the change of
basis is the same for all wavelets which satisfy a multiresolution analysis.
