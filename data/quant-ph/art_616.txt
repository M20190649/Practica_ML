Symmetries of the free Schrodinger Equation
An algorithm is proposed for research into the symmetrical properties of
theoretical and mathematical physics equations. The application of this
algorithm to the free Schrodinger equation permited us to establish that in
addition to the known Galilei symmetry, the free Schrodinger equation possesses
also the relativistic symmetry in some generalized sense. This property of the
free Schrodinger equation permits the equation to be extended into the
relativistic area of movements of a particle being studied.
