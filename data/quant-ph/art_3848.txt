Quantum information distributors: Quantum network for symmetric and
  asymmetric cloning in arbitrary dimension and continuous limit
We show that for any Hilbert-space dimension, the optimal universal quantum
cloner can be constructed from essentially the same quantum circuit, i.e., we
find a universal design for universal cloners. In the case of infinite
dimensions (which includes continuous variable quantum systems) the universal
cloner reduces to an essentially classical device. More generally, we construct
a universal quantum circuit for distributing qudits in any dimension which acts
covariantly under generalized displacements and momentum kicks. The behavior of
this covariant distributor is controlled by its initial state. We show that
suitable choices for this initial state yield both universal cloners and
optimized cloners for limited alphabets of states whose states are related by
generalized phase-space displacements.
