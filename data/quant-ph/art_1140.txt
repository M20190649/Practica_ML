A Possible Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Probe of the Momentum-Position
  Uncertainty Relation
It is suggested that a measurement of the products of photoemission by alkali
atoms excited after extraction from a trap, might, using the EPR strategy, show
a significant violation of the momentum-position uncertainty relation. If this
failed, as is quite likely, possible causes, such as retroactive propagation of
influences and retrodiction failure, could be tested on the proposed apparatus.
