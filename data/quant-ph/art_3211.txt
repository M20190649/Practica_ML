Measurements in quantum physics: towards a physical picture of relevant
  processes
We propose a new structure of ensembles in quantum theory, based on the
recently introduced intrinsic properties of electrons and photons. On this
statistical basis the spreading of a wave-packet, collapse of the wave
function, the quantum eraser, and interaction-free measurements are re-analyzed
and the usual conceptual problems removed.
