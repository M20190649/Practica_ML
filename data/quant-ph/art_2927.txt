Quantum Computer Using Coupled Quantum Dot Molecules
We propose a method for implementation of a quantum computer using artificial
molecules. The artificial molecule consists of two coupled quantum dots stacked
along z direction and one single electron. One-qubit and two-qubit gates are
constructed by one molecule and two coupled molecules, respectively.The ground
state and the first excited state of the molecule are used to encode the |0>
and |1> states of a qubit. The qubit is manipulated by a resonant
electromagnetic wave that is applied directly to the qubit through a microstrip
line. The coupling between two qubits in a quantum controlled NOT gate is
switched on (off) by floating (grounding) the metal film electrodes. We study
the operations of the gates by using a box-shaped quantum dot model and
numerically solving a time-dependent Schridinger equation, and demonstrate that
the quantum gates can perform the quantum computation. The operating speed of
the gates is about one operation per 4ps. The reading operation of the output
of the quantum computer can be performed by detecting the polarization of the
qubits.
