Macroscopic quantum damping in SQUID rings
The measurement process is introduced in the dynamics of Josephson devices
exhibiting quantum behaviour in a macroscopic degree of freedom. The
measurement is shown to give rise to a dynamical damping mechanism whose
experimental observability could be relevant to understand decoherence in
macroscopic quantum systems.
