Maxwell Electromagnetic Theory, Planck's Radiation Law and Bose-Einstein
  Statistics
We give an example in which it is possible to understand quantum statistics
using classical concepts. This is done by studying the interaction of charged
matter oscillators with the thermal and zeropoint electromagnetic fields
characteristic of quantum electrodynamics and classical stochastic
electrodynamics. Planck's formula for the spectral distribution and the
elements of energy $ \hbar\omega $ are interpreted without resorting to
discontinuities. We also show the aspects in which our model calculation
complement other derivations of blackbody radiation spectrum without quantum
assumptions.
