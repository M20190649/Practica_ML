Self-Consistent Effective Action for Quantum Particle with
  Space-Dependent Mass
We calculate the quantum corrections to the classical action of a particle
with coordinate-dependent mass. The result is made self-consistent by a
variational approach, thus making it applicable to strong-couplings and
singular potentials. By including thermal fluctuations, the we obtain an
effective action whose classical Euler-Lagrange equation describes the motion
of a particle including quantum and thermal effects.
