A Comment on Fisher Information and Quantum Algorithms
We show that Grover's algorithm defines a geodesic in quantum Hilbert space
with the Fubini-Study metric. From statistical point of view Grover's algorithm
is characterized by constant Fisher's function. Quantum algorithms changing
complexity class as Shor's factorization does not preserve constant Fisher's
information. An adiabatic quantum factorization algorithm in non polynomial
time is presented to exemplify the result.
