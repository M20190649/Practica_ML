Canonical Transformations and the Hamilton-Jacobi Theory in Quantum
  Mechanics
Canonical transformations using the idea of quantum generating functions are
applied to construct a quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory, based on the analogy
with the classical case. An operator and a c-number forms of the time-dependent
quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation are derived and used to find dynamical
solutions of quantum problems. The phase-space picture of quantum mechanics is
discussed in connection with the present theory.
