Correcting the effects of spontaneous emission on cold trapped ions
We propose two quantum error correction schemes which increase the maximum
storage time for qubits in a system of cold trapped ions, using a minimal
number of ancillary qubits. Both schemes consider only the errors introduced by
the decoherence due to spontaneous emission from the upper levels of the ions.
Continuous monitoring of the ion fluorescence is used in conjunction with
selective coherent feedback to eliminate these errors immediately following
spontaneous emission events, and the conditional time evolution between quantum
jumps is removed by symmetrizing the quantum codewords.
