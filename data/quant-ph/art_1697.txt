On the Path Integral Treatment for an Aharonov-Bohm Field on the
  Hyperbolic Plane
In this paper I discuss by means of path integrals the quantum dynamics of a
charged particle on the hyperbolic plane under the influence of an
Aharonov-Bohm gauge field. The path integral can be solved in terms of an
expansion of the homotopy classes of paths. I discuss the interference pattern
of scattering by an Aharonov-Bohm gauge field in the flat space limit, yielding
a characteristic oscillating behavior in terms of the field strength. In
addition, the cases of the isotropic Higgs-oscillator and the Kepler-Coulomb
potential on the hyperbolic plane are shortly sketched.
