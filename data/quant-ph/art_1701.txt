Quantum radiation in a plane cavity with moving mirrors
We consider the electromagnetic vacuum field inside a perfect plane cavity
with moving mirrors, in the nonrelativistic approximation. We show that low
frequency photons are generated in pairs that satisfy simple properties
associated to the plane geometry. We calculate the photon generation rates for
each polarization as functions of the mechanical frequency by two independent
methods: on one hand from the analysis of the boundary conditions for moving
mirrors and with the aid of Green functions; and on the other hand by an
effective Hamiltonian approach. The angular and frequency spectra are discrete,
and emission rates for each allowed angular direction are obtained. We discuss
the dependence of the generation rates on the cavity length and show that the
effect is enhanced for short cavity lengths. We also compute the dissipative
force on the moving mirrors and show that it is related to the total radiated
energy as predicted by energy conservation.
