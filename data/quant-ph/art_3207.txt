Bell's Theorem and Nonlinear Systems
For all Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type experiments on deterministic systems the
Bell inequality holds, unless non-local interactions exist between certain
parts of the setup. Here we show that in nonlinear systems the Bell inequality
can be violated by non-local effects that are arbitrarily weak. Then we show
that the quantum result of the existing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type
experiments can be reproduced within deterministic models that include
arbitrarily weak non-local effects.
