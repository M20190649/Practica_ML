Aharonov-Bohm interference in the presence of metallic mesoscopic
  cylinders
This work studies the interference of electrons in the presence of a line of
magnetic flux surrounded by a normal-conducting mesoscopic cylinder at low
temperature. It is found that, while there is a supplementary phase
contribution from each electron of the mesoscopic cylinder, the sum of these
individual supplementary phases is equal to zero, so that the presence of a
normal-conducting mesoscopic ring at low temperature does not change the
Aharonov-Bohm interference pattern of the incident electron. It is shown that
it is not possible to ascertain by experimental observation that the shielding
electrons have responded to the field of an incident electron, and at the same
time to preserve the interference pattern of the incident electron. It is also
shown that the measuring of the transient magnetic field in the region between
the two paths of an electron interference experiment with an accuracy at least
equal to the magnetic field of the incident electron generates a phase
uncertainty which destroys the interference pattern.
