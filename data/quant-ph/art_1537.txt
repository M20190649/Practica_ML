Quantum computation with linear optics
We present a constructive method to translate small quantum circuits into
their optical analogues, using linear components of present-day quantum optics
technology only. These optical circuits perform precisely the computation that
the quantum circuits are designed for, and can thus be used to test the
performance of quantum algorithms. The method relies on the representation of
several quantum bits by a single photon, and on the implementation of universal
quantum gates using simple optical components (beam splitters, phase shifters,
etc.). The optical implementation of Brassard et al.'s teleportation circuit, a
non-trivial 3-bit quantum computation, is presented as an illustration.
