A Co-Operative Phenomena Type Local Realistic Theory
We analyze a conceivable type of local realistic theory, which we call a
co-operative phenomena type local realistic theory. In an experimental
apparatus to measure second or fourth order interference effects, it images
that their exists a stable global pattern or mode in a hypothesized medium that
is at least the size of the coherence volume of all the involved beams. If you
change the position of a mirror, beam splitter, polarizer, state preparation,
or block a beam then a new and different stable global state is entered very
quickly. In an interferometer a photon passes only one arm of the apparatus but
knows if the other arm is open or closed since the global pattern through which
it travels through contains this information and guides it appropriately. In a
polarization correlation experiment, two distant polarizers are part of the
same global pattern or state which is very rapidly determined by the whole
apparatus. It is experimentally testable. The situation in relationship to the
special relativity is also discussed.
