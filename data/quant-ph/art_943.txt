A Multiparticle Generalization of Entanglement Swapping
We generalize the procedure of entanglement swapping to obtain a scheme for
manipulating entanglement in multiparticle systems. We describe how this scheme
allows to establish multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to
distant users in a communication network through a prior distribution of
singlets followed by only local measurements. We show that this scheme can be
regarded as a method of generating entangled states of many particles and
compare it with existing schemes using simple quantum computational networks.
We highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement
swappings during the distribution of entangled particles between two parties.
Applications of multiparticle entangled states in cryptographic conferencing
and in reading messages from more than one source through a single measurement
are also described.
