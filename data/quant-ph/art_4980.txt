A GHZ-type proof of Bell's Theorem for A Two-particle Singlet State
For the case of two spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state, we provide a
GHZ-type proof of Bell's theorem by using the idea of postselected
measurements. Furthermore, we show that in spite of the low efficiency of the
detectors one can derive an inequality in the case of real experiments which is
violated by quantum mechanics.
