Universal dynamical control of quantum mechanical decay: Modulation of
  the coupling to the continuum
We derive and investigate an expression for the dynamically modified decay of
states coupled to an arbitrary continuum. This expression is universally valid
for weak temporal perturbations. The resulting insights can serve as useful
recipes for optimized control of decay and decoherence.
