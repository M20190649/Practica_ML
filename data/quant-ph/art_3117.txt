Phase properties of a new nonlinear coherent state
We study phase properties of a displacement operator type nonlinear coherent
state. In particular we evaluate the Pegg-Barnett phase distribution and
compare it with phase distributions associated with the Husimi Q function and
the Wigner function. We also study number- phase squeezing of this state.
