Spin measurement retrodiction revisited
The retrodiction of spin measurements along a set of different axes is
revisited in detail. The problem is presented in two different pictures, a
geometric and a general algebraic one. Explicit measurement operators that
allow the retrodiction are given for the case of three and four axes. For the
Vaidman-Aharanov-Albert case of three orthogonal axes the quantum network is
constructed for two different initial Bell states.
