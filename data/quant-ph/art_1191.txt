Free-space quantum key distribution
A working free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) system has been developed
and tested over a 205-m indoor optical path at Los Alamos National Laboratory
under fluorescent lighting conditions. Results show that free-space QKD can
provide secure real-time key distribution between parties who have a need to
communicate secretly.
