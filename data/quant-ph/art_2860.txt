Existence of the Schmidt decomposition for tripartite systems
For any bipartite quantum system the Schmidt decomposition allows us to
express the state vector in terms of a single sum instead of double sums. We
show the existence of the Schmidt decomposition for tripartite system under
certain condition. If the partial inner product of a basis (belonging to a
Hilbert space of smaller dimension) with the state of the composite system
gives a disentangled basis, then the Schmidt decomposition for a tripartite
system exists. In this case the reduced density matrix of each of the subsystem
has equal spectrum in the Schmidt basis.
