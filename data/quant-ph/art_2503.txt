The Possibility of Factorizable Contextual Hidden Variable Theories
Considering an extended type of Bohm's version of EPR thought experiment, we
derive Bell's inequality for the case of factorizable contextual hidden
variable theories which are consistent with the predictions of quantum theory.
Usually factorizability is associated with non-contextuality. Here, we show
that factorizability is consistent with contextuality, even for the ordinary
Bohm's version of EPR thought experiment.
