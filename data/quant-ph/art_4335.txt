Complete solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the time-dependent
  linear potential
The complete solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle with
time-dependent mass moving in a time-dependent linear potential are presented.
One solution is based on the wave function of the plane wave, and the other is
with the form of the Airy function. A comparison is made between the present
solution and former ones to show the completeness of the present solution.
