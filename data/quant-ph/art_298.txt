On The Quantum Theory of Hall Effect
We discuss a model of both classical and integer quantum Hall-effect which is
based on a semi-classical Schroedinger-Chern-Simons-action, where the
Ohm-equations result as equations of motion. The quantization of the classical
Chern-Simons-part of action under typical quantum Hall conditions results in
the quantized Hall conductivity. We show further that the classical Hall-effect
is described by a theory which arises as the classical limit of a theory of
quantum Hall-effect. The model explains also the preference and the domain of
the edge currents on the boundary of samples.
