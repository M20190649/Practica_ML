Dynamics with unitary phase operator:implications for Wigner's problem
We show that for general deformations of SU(2) algebra, the dynamics in terms
of ladder operators is preserved. This is done for a system of precessing
magnetic dipole in magnetic field, using the unitary phase operator which
arises in the polar decomposition of SU(2) operators. It is pointed out that
there is a single phase operator dynamics underlying the dynamics of usual and
deformed ladder operators.
