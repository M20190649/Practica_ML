On the spectrum of a Hamiltonian defined on su_q(2) and quantum optical
  models
Analytical expressions are given for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a
Hamiltonian with su_q(2) dynamical symmetry. The relevance of such an operator
in Quantum Optics is discussed. As an application, the ground state energy in
the Dicke model is studied through su_q(2) perturbation theory.
