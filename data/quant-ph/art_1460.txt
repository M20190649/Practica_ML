Quantum Whispers
It is shown that with the use of entanglement a specific two party
communication task can be done with a systematically smaller expected error
than any possible classical protocol could do. The example utilises the very
tight correlation between separate spin measurements on a singlet state for
small differences in the angles of these two measurements. An extension of this
example to many parties arranged in a row with only local, one-to-one
communication (whispering) is then considered. It is argued that in this
scenario there exists no reliable classical protocol, whereas in the quantum
case there does.
