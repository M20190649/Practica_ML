Collective Rabi Oscillations and Cold Collisions
We examine cold atomic collisions within a resonant optical cavity. The
quantized cavity mode can be used to manipulate the collisions between the cold
atoms, such that periodic exchange of excitations between the atoms and the
electromagnetic field strongly alters the collision dynamics. A colliding pair
of atoms can thereby oscillate between its ground and excited states during the
collision time. Using a semiclassical model, it can be predicted that such
Rabi-like oscillations are revealed in the atomic trap-loss probabilities,
which show maxima and minima as a function of the detuning between the
frequencies of the mode and the atomic transition.
