Stationary Flows of the Parabolic Potential Barrier in Two Dimensions
In the two-dimensional isotropic parabolic potential barrier $V(x, y)=V_0
-m\gamma^2 (x^2+y^2)/2$, though it is a model of an unstable system in quantum
mechanics, we can obtain the stationary states corresponding to the real energy
eigenvalue $V_0$. Further, they are infinitely degenerate. For the first few
eigenstates, we will find the stationary flows round a right angle that are
expressed by the complex velocity potentials $W=\pm\gamma z^2/2$.
