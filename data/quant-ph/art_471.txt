A direct proof of completeness of squeezed odd-number states
A direct proof of the resolution of the identity in the odd sector of the
Fock space in terms of squeezed number states $D(\xi)|2m+1>; D(\xi) =
\exp(({\xi}a^{\dagger2}-{\xi}^*{a^2})/2)$ is given. The proof entails
evaluation of an integral involving Jacobi polynomials. This is achieved by the
use of Racah identities.
