Security of EPR-based Quantum Key Distribution
We propose a proof of the security of EPR-based quantum key distribution
against enemies with unlimited computational power. The proof holds for a
protocol using interactive error-reconciliation scheme. We assume in this paper
that the legitimate parties receive a given number of single photon signals and
that their measurement devices are perfect.
