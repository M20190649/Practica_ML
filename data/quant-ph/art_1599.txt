Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm for an Arbitrary Initial Amplitude
  Distribution
Grover's algorithm for quantum searching is generalized to deal with
arbitrary initial complex amplitude distributions. First order linear
difference equations are found for the time evolution of the amplitudes of the
marked and unmarked states. These equations are solved exactly. New expressions
are derived for the optimal time of measurement and the maximal probability of
success. They are found to depend on the averages and variances of the initial
amplitude distributions of the marked and unmarked states, but not on higher
moments. Our results imply that Grover's algorithm is robust against modest
noise in the amplitude initialization procedure.
