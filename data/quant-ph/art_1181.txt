Quantum mechanics of lattice gas automata. II. Boundary conditions and
  other inhomogeneities
We continue our analysis of the physics of quantum lattice gas automata
(QLGA). Previous work has been restricted to periodic or infinite lattices;
simulation of more realistic physical situations requires finite sizes and
non-periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, envisioning a QLGA as a
nanoscale computer architecture motivates consideration of inhomogeneities in
the `substrate'; this translates into inhomogeneities in the local evolution
rules. Concentrating on the one particle sector of the model, we determine the
various boundary conditions and rule inhomogeneities which are consistent with
unitary global evolution. We analyze the reflection of plane waves from
boundaries, simulate wave packet refraction across inhomogeneities, and
conclude by discussing the extension of these results to multiple particles.
