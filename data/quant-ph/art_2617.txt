Quantum particle constrained to a curved surface in the presence of a
  vector potential
The Schrodinger equation for a charged particle constrained to a curved
surface in the presence of a vector potential is derived using the method of
forms. In the limit that the particle is brought infinitesimally close to the
surface, a term arises that couples the component of the vector potential
normal to the surface to the mean curvature of the surface.
