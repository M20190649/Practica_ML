Unknown Quantum States: The Quantum de Finetti Representation
We present an elementary proof of the quantum de Finetti representation
theorem, a quantum analogue of de Finetti's classical theorem on exchangeable
probability assignments. This contrasts with the original proof of Hudson and
Moody [Z. Wahrschein. verw. Geb. 33, 343 (1976)], which relies on advanced
mathematics and does not share the same potential for generalization. The
classical de Finetti theorem provides an operational definition of the concept
of an unknown probability in Bayesian probability theory, where probabilities
are taken to be degrees of belief instead of objective states of nature. The
quantum de Finetti theorem, in a closely analogous fashion, deals with
exchangeable density-operator assignments and provides an operational
definition of the concept of an ``unknown quantum state'' in quantum-state
tomography. This result is especially important for information-based
interpretations of quantum mechanics, where quantum states, like probabilities,
are taken to be states of knowledge rather than states of nature. We further
demonstrate that the theorem fails for real Hilbert spaces and discuss the
significance of this point.
