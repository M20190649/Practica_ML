Field quantization by means of a single harmonic oscillator
A new scheme of field quantization is proposed. Instead of associating with
different frequencies different oscillators we begin with a single oscillator
that can exist in a superposition of different frequencies. The idea is applied
to the electromagnetic radiation field. Using the standard Dirac-type
mode-quantization of the electromagnetic field we obtain several standard
properties such as coherent states or spontaneous and stimulated emission. As
opposed to the standard approach the vacuum energy is finite and does not have
to be removed by any ad hoc procedure.
