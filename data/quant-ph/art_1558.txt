The Time's Arrow within the Uncertainty Quantum
A generalized framework is developed which uses a set description instead of
wavefunction to emphasize the role of the observer. Such a framework is found
to be very effective in the study of the measurement problem and time's arrow.
Measurement in classical and quantum theory is given a unified treatment. With
the introduction of the concept of uncertainty quantum which is the basic unit
of measurement, we show that the time's arrow within the uncertainty quantum is
just opposite to the time's arrow in the observable reality. A special constant
is discussed which explains our sensation of time and provides a permanent
substrate for all change. It is shown that the whole spacetime connects
together in a delicate structure.
