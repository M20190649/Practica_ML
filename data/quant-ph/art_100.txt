Nonlinear Schroedinger Dynamics and Nonlinear Observables
It is is explained why physical consistency requires substituting linear
observables by nonlinear ones for quantum systems with nonlinear time evolution
of pure states. The exact meaning and the concrete physical interpretation are
described in full detail for a special case of the nonlinear Doebner-Goldin
equation.
