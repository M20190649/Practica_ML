Error Correction with Euclidean Qubits
In classical case there is simplest method of error correction with using
three equal bits instead of one. In the paper is shown, how the scheme fails
for quantum error correction with complex vector spaces of usual quantum
mechanics, but works in real and quaternionic cases. It is discussed also, how
to implement the three qubits scheme with using encoding of quaternionic qubit
by Majorana spinor. Necessary concepts and formulae from area of quantum error
corrections are closely introduced and proved.
