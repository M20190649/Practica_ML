Extension Of Bertrand's Theorem And Factorization Of The Radial
  Schr√∂dinger Equation
The Bertrand's theorem is extended, i.e. closed orbits still may exist for
other central potentials than the power law Coulomb potential and isotropic
harmonic oscillator. It is shown that for the combined potential
$V(r)=W(r)+b/r^2$ ($W(r)=ar^{\nu}$), when (and only when) $W(r)$ is the Coulomb
potential or isotropic harmonic oscillator, closed orbits still exist for
suitable angular momentum. The correspondence between the closeness of
classical orbits and the existence of raising and lowering operators derived
from the factorization of the radial Schr\"odinger equation is investigated.
