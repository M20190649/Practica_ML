Good Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Exist
A quantum error-correcting code is defined to be a unitary mapping (encoding)
of k qubits (2-state quantum systems) into a subspace of the quantum state
space of n qubits such that if any t of the qubits undergo arbitrary
decoherence, not necessarily independently, the resulting n qubits can be used
to faithfully reconstruct the original quantum state of the k encoded qubits.
Quantum error-correcting codes are shown to exist with asymptotic rate k/n = 1
- 2H(2t/n) where H(p) is the binary entropy function -p log p - (1-p) log
(1-p). Upper bounds on this asymptotic rate are given.
