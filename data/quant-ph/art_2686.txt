Legitimacy of wave-function expansion
In this letter we investigate the common procedure in which any wave function
is expanded into a series of eigenfunctions. It is shown that as far as
dynamical systems are concerned the expanding procedure involves various
mathematical and physical difficulties. With or without introducing phase
factors, such expansions do not represent dynamical wave functions.
