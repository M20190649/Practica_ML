Binding entanglement channels
We define the binding entanglement channel as the quantum channel through
which quantum information cannot be reliably transmitted, but which can be used
to share bound entanglement. We provide a characterization of such class of
channels. We also show that any bound entangled state can be used to
construction of the map corresponding the binding entanglement channel.
