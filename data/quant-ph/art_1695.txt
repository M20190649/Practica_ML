Using Conditional Measurements to Combat Decoherence
With the help of some remarkable examples, it is shown that conditional
measurements performed on two-level atoms just after they have interacted with
a resonant cavity field mode are able to recover the coherence of number-state
superpositions, which is lost due to dissipation.
