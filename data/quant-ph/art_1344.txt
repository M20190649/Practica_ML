Quantum transfer functions, weak nonlocality and relativity
The method of transfer functions is developed as a tool for studying Bell
inequalities, alternative quantum theories and the associated physical
properties of quantum systems. Non-negative probabilities for transfer
functions result in Bell-type inequalities. The method is used to show that all
realistic Lorentz-invariant quantum theories, which give unique results and
have no preferred frame, can be ruled out on the grounds that they lead to weak
backward causality.
