Mermin's Suggestion and the Nature of Bohr's Action-at-a-Distance
  Influence
Mermin suggests comparing my recent proof of quantum nonlocality to Bohr's
reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. Doing so leads naturally to the insight
that the nonlocal influence deduced from the analysis of the Hardy experiment
is the same as the nonlocal influence deduced by Bohr, and used by him to block
the application of the criterion of physical reality proposed by Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen. However, the greater sophistication of the Hardy
experiment, as contrasted to the experiment considered by Bohr and the three
authors, exposes more clearly than before the nature of this influence, and
thereby strengthens Bohr's position.
