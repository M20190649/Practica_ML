On the nature of continuous physical quantities in classical and quantum
  mechanics
Within the traditional Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, it is
not possible to describe a particle as possessing, simultaneously, a sharp
position value and a sharp momentum value. Is it possible, though, to describe
a particle as possessing just a sharp position value (or just a sharp momentum
value)? Some, such as Teller (Journal of Philosophy, 1979), have thought that
the answer to this question is No -- that the status of individual continuous
quantities is very different in quantum mechanics than in classical mechanics.
On the contrary, I shall show that the same subtle issues arise with respect to
continuous quantities in classical and quantum mechanics; and that it is, after
all, possible to describe a particle as possessing a sharp position value
without altering the standard formalism of quantum mechanics.
