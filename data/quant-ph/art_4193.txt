Lowest threshold visibility for testing local realistic theories
Analytical and numerical arguments are presented in case of a pair of
two-state systems in a singlet state that the threshold visibility for testing
Bell's theorem on the entire range of measurement settings is 33.3%. It is also
shown that no lower treshold exists.
