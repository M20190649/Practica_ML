A genuine reinterpretation of the Heisenberg's ("uncertainty") relations
In spite \smallskip of their popularity the \QTR{bf}{H}eisenberg's
(``uncertainty'') \QTR{bf}{R}elations (HR) still generate controversies. The
\QTR{bf}{T}raditional \QTR{bf}{I}nterpretation of HR (TIHR) dominate our days
science, although over the years a lot of its defects were signaled. These
facts justify a reinvestigation of the questions connected with the
interpretation / significance of HR. Here it is developped such a
reinvestigation starting with a revaluation of the main elements of TIHR. So
one finds that all the respective elements are troubled by insurmountable
defects. Then it results the indubitable failure of TIHR and the necessity of
its abandonment. Consequently the HR must be deprived of their quality of
crucial physical formulae. Moreover the HR are shown to be nothing but simple
fluctuations formulae with natural analogous in classical (non-quantum)
physics. The description of the maesuring uncertainties (traditionally
associated with HR) is approached from a new informational perspective. The
Planck's constant $\hbar $ (also associated with HR) is revealed to have a
significance of generic indicator for quantum stochasticity, similarly with the
role of Boltzmann's constant k in respect with the thermal stochasticity.
