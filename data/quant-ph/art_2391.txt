Coulomb-oscillator duality in spaces of constant curvature
In this paper we construct generalizations to spheres of the well known
Levi-Civita, Kustaanheimo-Steifel and Hurwitz regularizing transformations in
Euclidean spaces of dimensions 2, 3 and 5. The corresponding classical and
quantum mechanical analogues of the Kepler-Coulomb problem on these spheres are
discussed.
