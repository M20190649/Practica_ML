Bell Measurements and Observables
A general matrix approach to study entangled states is presented, based on
operator completeness relations. Bases of unitary operators are considered,
with focus on irreducible representations of groups. Bell measurements for
teleportation are considered, and robustness of teleportation to various kinds
of non idealities is shown.
