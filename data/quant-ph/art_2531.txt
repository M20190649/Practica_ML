Tomographic test of Bell's inequality
We present a homodyne detection scheme to verify Bell's inequality on
correlated optical beams at the output of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier.
Our approach is based on tomographic measurement of the joint detection
probabilities, which allows high quantum efficiency at detectors. A
self-homodyne scheme is suggested to simplify the experimental set-up.
