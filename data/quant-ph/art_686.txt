On Scale Invariance and Anomalies in Quantum Mechanics
We re-consider the quantum mechanics of scale invariant potentials in two
dimensions. The breaking of scale invariance by quantum effects is analyzed by
the explicit evaluation of the phase shift and the self-adjoint extension
method. We argue that the breaking of scale invariance reported in the
literature for the $\delta$(r) potential, is an example of explicit and not an
anomaly or quantum mechanical symmetry breaking.
