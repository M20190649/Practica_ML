Analytic Expression for Exact Ground State Energy Based on an Operator
  Method for a Class of Anharmonic Potentials
A general procedure based on shift operators is formulated to deal with
anharmonic potentials. It is possible to extract the ground state energy
analytically using our method provided certain consistency relations are
satisfied. Analytic expressions for the exact ground state energy have also
been derived specifically for a large class of the one-dimensional oscillator
with cubic-quartic anharmonic terms. Our analytical results can be used to
check the accuracy of existing numerical methods, for instance the method of
state-dependent diagonalization. Our results also agree with the asymptotic
behavior in the divergent pertubative expansion of quartic harmonic oscillator.
