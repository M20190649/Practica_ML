The ground state of a spin-1/2 neutral particle with anomalous magnetic
  moment in a Aharonov-Casher configuration
We determine the (bound) ground state of a spin 1/2 chargless particle with
anomalous magnetic moment in certain Aharonov-Casher configurations. We recast
the description of the system in a supersymmetric form. Then the basic physical
requirements for unbroken supersymmetry are established. We comment on the
possibility of neutron trapping in these systems.
