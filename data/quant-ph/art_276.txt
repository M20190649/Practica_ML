What are quantum theorists doing at a conference on consciousness?
The reason why orthodox quantum theory necessarily invokes consciousness is
explained. Several procedures whereby the Born probability rule can be
introduced are discussed, and reasons are given for prefering one in which
consciousness selects a unique realised world. Consciousness is something
outside of the laws of physics (quantum mechanics), but it has a real effect
upon the experienced world. Finally, orthodox quantum theory is shown to
require that consciousness acts non-locally.
