Time and the Mind/Body Problem: A Quantum Perspective
The Semiotic Interpretation (SI) of QM pushes further the Von Neumann point
of view that `experience only makes statements of this type: an observer has
made a certain observation; and never any like this: a physical quantity has a
certain value.' The supposition that the observables of a system `possess'
objective values is purely idealistic. According to the SI view, the state-
vector collapse cannot result from the Schroedinger evolution of a system (even
with its environment), but only from the empirical production of a mathematical
symbol, irreducible to the quantum level. The production of a symbol always
takes some time. Thus the state-vector collapse cannot be instantaneous
(Schneider 1994), a specific prediction of the present model.
  From this interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the appearances of the body
are the result of state-vector collapses of several types, i.e. the production
of different kinds of symbols. In fact the universe of symbols is very rich: a
symbol can have a conceptual `value' (like in physics and then give rise to a
measurement), or other qualitative values (like in many human behaviors). In
the latter case, the Semiotic Interpretation of QM gives a way to understand
how a mental representation can modify the state of the body.
