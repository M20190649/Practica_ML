Thomas Rotation and Polarised Light: A non-Abelian Geometric Phase in
  Optics
We describe a non-Abelian Berry phase in polarisation optics, suggested by an
analogy due to Nityananda between boosts in special relativity and the effect
of elliptic dichroism on polarised light. The analogy permits a simple optical
realization of the non-Abelian gauge field describing Thomas rotation. We also
show how Thomas rotation can be understood geometrically on the Poincar\'{e}
sphere in terms of the Pancharatnam phase.
