Marginal and correlation distribution functions in the squeezed-states
  representation
Here we consider the Husimi function P for the squeezed states and calculate
the marginal and correlation distribution functions when P is projected onto
the photon number states. According to the value of the squeezing parameter one
verifies the occurence of oscillations and beats as already appointed in the
literature. We verify that these phenomena are entirely contained in the
correlation function. In particular, we show that since Husimi and its marginal
distribution functions satisfy partial differential equations where the squeeze
parameter plays the role of time, the solutions (the squeezed functions
obtained from initial unsqueezed functions) can be expressed by means of
kernels responsible for the propagation of squeezing. From the calculational
point of view, this method presents advantages for calculating the marginal
distribution functions (compared to a direct integration over one of the two
phase-space variables of P) since one can use the symmetry properties of the
differential equations.
