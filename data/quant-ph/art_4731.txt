Non Linear Compton Scattering of Strong Laser Radiation on Channeled
  Particles in a Crystal
A version for intense $\gamma $-ray radiation based on the multiphoton
scattering of strong laser radiation on relativistic particle beam channeled in
a crystal is proposed. The scheme is considered when the incident laser beam
and charged paricles beam are counter-propagating and the laser radiation is
resonant to the energy levels of transversal motion of channeled particles.
