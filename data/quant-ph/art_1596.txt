Optimum Unambiguous Discrimination Between Linearly Independent
  Symmetric States
The quantum formalism permits one to discriminate sometimes between any set
of linearly-independent pure states with certainty. We obtain the maximum
probability with which a set of equally-likely, symmetric, linearly-independent
states can be discriminated. The form of this bound is examined for symmetric
coherent states of a harmonic oscillator or field mode.
