Transfer of quantum states using finite resources
We discuss the problem of transfering a qubit from Alice to Bob using a noisy
quantum channel and only finite resources. As the basic protocol for the
transfer we apply quantum teleportation. It turns out that for a certain
quality of the channel direct teleportation combined with qubit purification is
superior to entanglement purification of the channel. If, however, the quality
of the channel is rather low one should simply apply an estimation-preparation
scheme.
