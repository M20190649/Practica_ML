Separability Properties of Three-mode Gaussian States
We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of
tripartite three mode Gaussian states, that is easy to check for any such
state. We give a classification of the separability properties of those systems
and show how to determine for any state to which class it belongs. We show that
there exist genuinely tripartite bound entangled states and point out how to
construct and prepare such states.
