Momentum distribution of confined bosons: temperature dependence
The momentum distribution function of a parabolically confined gas of bosons
with harmonic interparticle interactions is derived. In the Bose-Einstein
condensation region, this momentum distribution substantially deviates from a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. It is argued that the determination of the
temperature of the boson gas from the Bose-Einstein momentum distribution
function is more appropriate than the currently used fitting to the high
momentum tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
