Generalized Algebraic Bargmann - Darboux Transformations
Algebraic Bargmann and Darboux transformations for equations of a more
general form than the Schr\"odinger ones with an additional functional
dependence h(r) in the right-hand side of equations are constructed. The
suggested generalized transformations turn into the Bargmann and Darboux
transformations for both fixed and variable values of energy and an angular
momentum.
