Polarization Squeezing of Continuous Variable Stokes Parameters
We report the first direct experimental characterization of continuous
variable quantum Stokes parameters. We generate a continuous wave light beam
with more than 3 dB of simultaneous squeezing in three of the four Stokes
parameters. The polarization squeezed beam is produced by mixing two quadrature
squeezed beams on a polarizing beam splitter. Depending on the squeezed
quadrature of these two beams the quantum uncertainty volume on the
Poincar\'{e} sphere became a `cigar' or `pancake'-like ellipsoid.
