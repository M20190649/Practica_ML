Some properties of quantum reiliablity function for quantum
  communication channel
This paper presents some examples of quantum reliability function for the
quantum communication system in which classical information is transmitted by
quantum states. In addition, the quantum Cut off rate is defined. They will be
compared with Gallager's reliability function for the same system.
