Maximization of capacity and p-norms for some product channels
It is conjectured that the Holevo capacity of a product channel \Omega
\otimes \Phi is achieved when product states are used as input. Amosov, Holevo
and Werner have also conjectured that the maximal p-norm of a product channel
is achieved with product input states. In this paper we establish both of these
conjectures in the case that \Omega is arbitrary and \Phi is a CQ or QC channel
(as defined by Holevo). We also establish the Amosov, Holevo and Werner
conjecture when \Omega is arbitrary and either \Phi is a qubit channel and p=2,
or \Phi is a unital qubit channel and p is integer. Our proofs involve a new
conjecture for the norm of an output state of the half-noisy channel I \otimes
\Phi, when \Phi is a qubit channel. We show that this conjecture in some cases
also implies additivity of the Holevo capacity.
