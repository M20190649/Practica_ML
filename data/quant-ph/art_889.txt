Quantum Networking with Optical Fibres
I propose a scheme which allows for reliable transfer of quantum information
between two atoms via an optical fibre in the presence of decoherence. The
scheme is based on performing an adiabatic passage through two cavities which
remain in their respective vacuum states during the whole operation. The scheme
may be useful for networking several ion-trap quantum computers, thereby
increasing the number of quantum bits involved in a computation.
