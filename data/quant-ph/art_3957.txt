Analysis of Generalized Grover's Quantum Search Algorithms Using
  Recursion Equations
The recursion equation analysis of Grover's quantum search algorithm
presented by Biham et al. [PRA 60, 2742 (1999)] is generalized. It is applied
to the large class of Grover's type algorithms in which the Hadamard transform
is replaced by any other unitary transformation and the phase inversion is
replaced by a rotation by an arbitrary angle. The time evolution of the
amplitudes of the marked and unmarked states, for any initial complex amplitude
distribution is expressed using first order linear difference equations. These
equations are solved exactly. The solution provides the number of iterations T
after which the probability of finding a marked state upon measurement is the
highest, as well as the value of this probability, P_max. Both T and P_max are
found to depend on the averages and variances of the initial amplitude
distributions of the marked and unmarked states, but not on higher moments.
