Radiation field quantization in a nonlinear dielectric with dispersion
  and absorption
The problem of quantizing the radiation field inside a nonlinear dielectric
is studied. Based on the quantization of radiation in a linear dielectric which
includes absorption and dispersion, we extend the theory in order to treat also
nonlinear optical processes. We derive propagation equations in space and time
for the quantized radiation field including the effects of linear absorption
and dispersion as well as nonlinear optical effects. As a special case we
derive the propagation equation of a narrow-frequency band light pulse in a
Kerr medium.
