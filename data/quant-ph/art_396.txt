Wigner Distributions and the Joint Measurement of Incompatible
  Observables
A theory of joint nonideal measurement of incompatible observables is used in
order to assess the relative merits of quantum tomography and certain
measurements of generalized observables, with respect to completeness of the
obtained information. A method is studied for calculating a Wigner distribution
from the joint probability distribution obtained in a joint measurement.
