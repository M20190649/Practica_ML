Qubit logic modeling by electronic circuits and electromagnetic signals
In the paper an approach is presented allowing to model quantum logic
circuits by electronic gates for discrete spatially modulated electromagnetic
signals. The designed circuitry is for modeling low scale quantum nets of
general design and quantum devices based only on superposition principle of
their work.
