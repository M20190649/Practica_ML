Extension of the Staruszkiewicz Modification of the Schroedinger
  Equation
We present an extension of Staruszkiewicz's modification of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation which preserves its main and unique feature: in the
natural system of units the modification terms do not contain any dimensional
constants. The extension, similarly as the original, is formulated in a
three-dimensional space and derives from a Galilean invariant Lagrangian. It is
pointed out that this model of nonlinearity violates the separability of
compound systems in the fundamentalist approach to this issue. In its general
form, this modification does not admit stationary states for all potentials for
which such states exist in linear quantum mechanics. This is, however, possible
for a suitable choice of its free parameters. It is only in the original
Staruszkiewicz modification that the energy of these states remains unchanged,
which marks the uniqueness of this variant of the modification.
