Tools for Quantum Algorithms
We present efficient implementations of a number of operations for quantum
computers. These include controlled phase adjustments of the amplitudes in a
superposition, permutations, approximations of transformations and
generalizations of the phase adjustments to block matrix transformations. These
operations generalize those used in proposed quantum search algorithms.
