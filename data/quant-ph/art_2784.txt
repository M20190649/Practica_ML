Quantum probability from a geometrical interpretation of a wave function
The probabilistic prediction of quantum theory is mystery. I solved the
mystery by a geometrical interpretation of a wave function. This suggests the
unification between quantum theory and the theory of relativity. This suggests
Many-Worlds Interpretation is true, too.
