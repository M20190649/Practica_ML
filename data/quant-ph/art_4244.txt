A More General Quantum Searching Algorithm And the Precise Formula of
  the Amplitude and the Non-symmetric Effects of Different Rotating Angles
This paper presented two general quantum search algorithms. We derived the
iterated formulas and the simpler approximate formulas and the precise formula
for the amplitude in the desired state. A mathematical proof of Grover's
algorithm being optimal among the algorithms with arbitrary phase rotations was
given in this paper. This first reported the non-symmetric effects of different
rotating angles, and gave the first-order approximate phase condition when
rotating angles are different.
