Restoration of Entanglement by Spectral Filters
We experimentally demonstrate that entanglement of bi-photon polarization
state can be restored by spectral filters. This restoration procedure can be
viewed as a new class of quantum eraser, which retrieves entanglement rather
than just interference by manipulating an ancillary degree of freedom.
