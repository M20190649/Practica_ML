Emergence of Classicality: From Collapse Phenomenologies to Hybrid
  Dynamics
In the past ten-fifteen years, stochastic models of continuous wave function
collapse were being proposed to describe the continuous emergence of
classicality from quantum. We advocate that the hybrid dynamics of canonically
coupled quantum and classical systems is a more basic concept. Continuous
collapse formalisms are obtained as special cases. To illustrate our claim we
show how von Neumann collapse follows from hybrid dynamical equations.
