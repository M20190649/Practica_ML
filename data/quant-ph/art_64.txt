ON THE QUANTUM EVOLUTION OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS AFFECTED BY REPEATED
  FREQUENT MEASUREMENT
We investigate the effect of repeated measurement for quantum dynamics of the
suppressed systems which classical counterparts exhibit chaos. The essential
feature of such systems is the quantum localization phenomena strongly limiting
motion in the energy space. Repeated frequent measurement of suppressed systems
results to the delocalization. Time evolution of the observed chaotic systems
becomes close to the classical frequently broken diffusion-like process
described by rate equations for the probabilities rather than for amplitudes.
