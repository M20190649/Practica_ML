Classical Analog of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency
We present a classical analog for Electromagnetically Induced Transparency
(EIT). In a system of just two coupled harmonic oscillators subject to a
harmonic driving force we can reproduce the phenomenology observed in EIT. We
describe a simple experiment performed with two linearly coupled RLC circuits
which can be taught in an undergraduate laboratory class.
