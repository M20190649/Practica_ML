Toward scalable quantum computation with cavity QED systems
We propose a scheme for quantum computing using high-Q cavities in which the
qubits are represented by single cavity modes restricted in the space spanned
by the two lowest Fock states. We show that single qubit operations and
universal multiple qubit gates can be implemented using atoms sequentially
crossing the cavities.
