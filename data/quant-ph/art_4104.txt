Noise and Order in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics
In this paper we investigate the various aspects of noise and order in the
micromaser system. In particular, we study the effect of adding fluctuations to
the atom cavity transit time or to the atom-photon frequency detuning. By
including such noise-producing mechanisms we study the probability and the
joint probability for excited atoms to leave the cavity. The influence of such
fluctuations on the phase structure of the micromaser as well as on the
long-time atom correlation length is also discussed. We also derive the
asymptotic form of micromaser observables.
