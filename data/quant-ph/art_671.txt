Quantifying Entanglement
We present conditions every measure of entanglement has to satisfy and
construct a whole class of 'good' entanglement measures. The generalization of
our class of entanglement measures to more than two particles is
straightforward. We present a measure which has a statistical operational basis
that might enable experimental determination of the quantitative degree of
entanglement.
