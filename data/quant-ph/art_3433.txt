Minimal Irreversible Quantum Mechanics: An Axiomatic Formalism
An axiomatic formalism for a minimal irreversible quantum mechanics is
introduced. It is shown that a quantum equilibrium and the decoherence
phenomenon are consequences of the axioms and that Lyapunov variables,
exponential survival probabilities, and a classisal conditional
never-decreasing entropy can be defined.
