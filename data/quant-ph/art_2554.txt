Trapping of single atoms in cavity QED
By integrating the techniques of laser cooling and trapping with those of
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), single Cesium atoms have been trapped
within the mode of a small, high finesse optical cavity in a regime of strong
coupling. The observed lifetime for individual atoms trapped within the cavity
mode is $\tau \approx 28$ms, and is limited by fluctuations of light forces
arising from the far-detuned intracavity field. This initial realization of
trapped atoms in cavity QED should enable diverse protocols in quantum
information science.
