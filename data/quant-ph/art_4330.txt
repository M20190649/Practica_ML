Discrimination between nonorthogonal two-photon polarization states
It is shown that generalized measurements, required for optimally
discriminating between nonorthogonal joint polarization states of two
indistinguishable photons, can be realized with the help of
polarization-dependent two-photon absorption and by means of sum-frequency
generation. Optimization schemes are investigated with respect to minimizing
the error probability in inferring the states, as well as with respect to
maximizing the probability of success for unambiguous discrimination. Moreover,
an implementation of error-minimizing discrimination between N symmetric
single-photon states is studied. The latter can be used to extract information
from the inconclusive results occurring in unambiguous discrimination between
three symmetric two-photon polarization states.
