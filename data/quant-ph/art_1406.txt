A Parallel Quantum Computer Simulator
A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can efficiently solve
complex problems such as prime factorization. A quantum computer threatens the
security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the
fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the
effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of
quantum com puters, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast
amount of processing and memory resources. In this paper we describe a parallel
simulator which accesses the feasibility of quantum computers. We also derive
and validate an analytical model of execution time for the simulator, which
shows that parallel quantum computer simulation is very scalable.
