Exact uncertainty relations: physical significance
The Heisenberg inequality \Delta X \Delta P \geq \hbar/2 can be replaced by
an exact equality, for suitably chosen measures of position and momentum
uncertainty, which is valid for all wavefunctions. The statistics of
complementary observables are thus connected by an ``exact'' uncertainty
relation.
