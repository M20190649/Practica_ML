Optimal Cloning of Pure States, Judging Single Clones
We consider quantum devices for turning a finite number N of d-level quantum
systems in the same unknown pure state \sigma into M>N systems of the same
kind, in an approximation of the M-fold tensor product of the state \sigma. In
a previous paper it was shown that this problem has a unique optimal solution,
when the quality of the output is judged by arbitrary measurements, involving
also the correlations between the clones. We show in this paper, that if the
quality judgement is based solely on measurements of single output clones,
there is again a unique optimal cloning device, which coincides with the one
found previously.
