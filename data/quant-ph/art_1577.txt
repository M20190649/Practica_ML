Simulating quantum operations with mixed environments
We study the physical resources required to implement general quantum
operations, and provide new bounds on the minimum possible size which an
environment must be in order to perform certain quantum operations. We prove
that contrary to a previous conjecture, not all quantum operations on a
single-qubit can be implemented with a single-qubit environment, even if that
environment is initially prepared in a mixed state. We show that a mixed
single-qutrit environment is sufficient to implement a special class of
operations, the generalized depolarizing channels.
