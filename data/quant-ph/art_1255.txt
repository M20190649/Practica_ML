Schroedinger's interpolation problem through Feynman-Kac kernels
We discuss the so-called Schr{\"o}dinger problem of deducing the microscopic
(basically stochastic) evolution that is consistent with given positive
boundary probability densities for a process covering a finite fixed time
interval. The sought for dynamics may preserve the probability measure or
induce its evolution, and is known to be uniquely reproducible, if the Markov
property is required. Feynman-Kac type kernels are the principal ingredients of
the solution and determine the transition probability density of the
corresponding stochastic process. The result applies to a large variety of
nonequilibrium statistical physics and quantum situations.
