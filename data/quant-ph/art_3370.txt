Hidden Variables or Positive Probabilities?
Despite claims that Bell's inequalities are based on the Einstein locality
condition, or equivalent, all derivations make an identical mathematical
assumption: that local hidden-variable theories produce a set of
positive-definite probabilities for detecting a particle with a given spin
orientation. The standard argument is that because quantum mechanics assumes
that particles are emitted in a superposition of states the theory cannot
produce such a set of probabilities. We examine a paper by Eberhard, and
several similar papers, which claim to show that a generalized Bell inequality,
the CHSH inequality, can be derived solely on the basis of the locality
condition, without recourse to hidden variables. We point out that these
authors nonetheless assumes a set of positive-definite probabilities, which
supports the claim that hidden variables or "locality" is not at issue here,
positive-definite probabilities are. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics does
predict a set of probabilities that violate the CHSH inequality; however these
probabilities are not positive-definite. Nevertheless, they are physically
meaningful in that they give the usual quantum-mechanical predictions in
physical situations. We discuss in what sense our results are related to the
Wigner distribution.
