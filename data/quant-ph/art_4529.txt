Fuzziness in Quantum Mechanics
It is shown that quantum mechanics can be regarded as what one might call a
"fuzzy" mechanics whose underlying logic is the fuzzy one, in contradistinction
to the classical "crisp" logic. Therefore classical mechanics can be viewed as
a crisp limit of a "fuzzy" quantum mechanics. Based on these considerations it
is possible to arrive at the Schroedinger equation directly from the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The link between these equations is based on the fact
that a unique ("crisp") trajectory of a classical particle emerges out of a
continuum of possible paths collapsing to a single trajectory according to the
principle of least action. This can be interpreted as a consequence of an
assumption that a quantum "particle" "resides" in every path of the continuum
of paths which collapse to a single(unique) trajectory of an observed classical
motion. A wave function then is treated as a function describing a
deterministic entity having a fuzzy character. As a consequence of such an
interpretation, the complimentarity principle and wave-particle duality can be
abandoned in favor of a fuzzy deterministic microoobject.
