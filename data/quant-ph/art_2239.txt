Against Quantum Noise
This is a brief description of how to protect quantum states from dissipation
and decoherence that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the
environment. We discuss recoherence and stabilisation of quantum states based
on two techniques known as "symmetrisation" and "quantum error correction". We
illustrate our considerations with the most popular quantum-optical model of
the system-environment interaction, commonly used to describe spontaneous
emission, and show the benefits of quantum error correction in this case.
