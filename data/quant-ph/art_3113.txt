Methodology for quantum logic gate constructions
We present a general method to construct fault-tolerant quantum logic gates
with a simple primitive, which is an analog of quantum teleportation. The
technique extends previous results based on traditional quantum teleportation
(Gottesman and Chuang, Nature {\bf 402}, 390, 1999) and leads to
straightforward and systematic construction of many fault-tolerant encoded
operations, including the $\pi/8$ and Toffoli gates. The technique can also be
applied to the construction of remote quantum operations that cannot be
directly performed.
