Entanglement Enhanced Multiplayer Quantum Games
We investigate the 3-player quantum Prisoner's Dilemma with a certain
strategic space, a particular Nash equilibrium that can remove the original
dilemma is found. Based on this equilibrium, we show that the game is enhanced
by the entanglement of its initial state.
