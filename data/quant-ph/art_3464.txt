Aspects of nonlocality in atom-photon interactions in a cavity
We investigate a Bell-type inequality for probabilities of detected atoms
formulated using atom-photon interactions in a cavity. We consider decoherence
brought about by both atomic decay, as well as cavity photon loss, and study
its quantitative action in diminishing the atom-field and the resultant
atom-atom secondary correlations. We show that the effects of decoherence on
nonlocality can be observed in a controlled manner in actual experiments
involving the micromaser and also the microlaser.
