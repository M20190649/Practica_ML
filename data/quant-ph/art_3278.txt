Conditional teleportation using optical squeezers and photon counting
We suggest a scheme of using two-mode squeezed vacuum for conditional
teleportation of quantum states of optical field. Alice mixes the input state
with one of the squeezed modes on another squeezing device and detects the
output photon numbers. The result is then communicated to Bob who shifts the
photon number of his part accordingly. This is a principally realizable
modification of the recent scheme [G.J. Milburn and S.L. Braunstein, Phys. Rev.
A 60, 937 (1999)] where measurements of photon number difference and phase sum
are considered. We show that for some classes of states this method can yield
very high fidelity of teleportation, nevertheless, the success probability may
be limited.
