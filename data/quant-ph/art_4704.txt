Classicality of quantum information processing
The ultimate goal of the classicality programme is to quantify the amount of
quantumness of certain processes. Here, classicality is studied for a
restricted type of process: quantum information processing (QIP). Under special
conditions, one can force some qubits of a quantum computer into a classical
state without affecting the outcome of the computation. The minimal set of
conditions is described and its structure is studied. Some implications of this
formalism are the increase of noise robustness, a proof of the quantumness of
mixed state quantum computing and a step forward in understanding the very
foundation of QIP.
