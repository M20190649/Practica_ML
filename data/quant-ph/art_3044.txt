Comment on "Hidden assumptions in decoherence theory"
It is shown that the conclusion of the paper "Hidden assumptions in
decoherence theory" (quant-ph/0001021) is the result of a misunderstanding of
the concept of pointer states. It is argued that pointer states are selected by
the interaction of quantum systems with the environment, and are not based on
any measurement by a conscious observer.
