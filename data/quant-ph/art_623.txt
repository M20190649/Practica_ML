Quantum Kinetic Theory III: Simulation of the Quantum Boltzmann Master
  Equation
We present results of simulations of a em quantum Boltzmann master equation
(QBME) describing the kinetics of a dilute Bose gas confined in a trapping
potential in the regime of Bose condensation. The QBME is the simplest version
of a quantum kinetic master equations derived in previous work. We consider two
cases of trapping potentials: a 3D square well potential with periodic boundary
conditions, and an isotropic harmonic oscillator. We discuss the stationary
solutions and relaxation to equilibrium. In particular, we calculate particle
distribution functions, fluctuations in the occupation numbers, the time
between collisions, and the mean occupation numbers of the one-particle states
in the regime of onset of Bose condensation.
