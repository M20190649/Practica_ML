Uhlmann's parallelism in quantum estimation theory
Two important classes of the quantum statistical model, the locally
quasi-classical model and the quasi-classical model, are introduced from the
estimation theoretical viewpoint, and they are characterized geometrically by
the vanishing conditions of the relative phase factor (RPF), implying the close
tie between Uhlmann parallel transport and the quantum estimation theory.
