Timing, ``Accidentals'' and Other Artifacts in EPR Experiments
Subtraction of ``accidentals'' in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments
frequently changes results compatible with local realism into ones that appear
to demonstrate non-locality. The validity of the procedure depends on the
unproven assumption of the independence of emission events. Other possible
sources of bias include enhancement, imperfect synchronisation, over-reliance
on rotational invariance, and the well-known detection loophole. Investigation
of existing results may be more fruitful than attempts at loophole-free Bell
tests, improving our understanding of light.
