Quantum Key Distribution using Two Coherent States of Light and their
  Superposition
Quantum mechanical complementarity ensures the security of the
key-distribution scheme reported by Brassard and Bennet in 1984 (BB84), but
does not prohibit use of multi-photons as a signal carrier. We describe a novel
BB84 scheme in which two nearly orthogonal coherent states carry the key, and
the superposition of these states (cat states) protects the communication
channel from eavesdropping. Information leakage to eavesdroppers can be
determined from the visibility of the interferential fringes in the
distribution of the outcome when a certain quadrature component is measured
through homodyne detection. The effect of channel loss and detector
inefficiency is discussed.
