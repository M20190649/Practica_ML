A necessary and sufficient criterion for multipartite separable states
We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of
multipartite quantum states, this criterion also tells us how to write a
multipartite separable state as a convex sum of separable pure states. To work
out this criterion, we need to solve a set of equations, actually it is easy to
solve these quations analytically if the density matrix of the given quantum
state has few nonzero eigenvalues.
