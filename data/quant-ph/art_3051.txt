The Physical Model of Schrodinger Electron. Schrodinger Convenient Way
  for Description of its Quantum Behaviour
The physical model (PhsMdl) of a Schrodinger nonrelativistic quantized
electron (ShEl) is built by means of a transition of the quadratic differential
particle equation of Hamilton-Jacoby into the quadratic differential wave
equation of Schrodinger in this work, which interprets the physical reason of
its quantum (wave and stochastic) behaviour by explanation of the physical
reason, which forces the classical Lorentz electron (LrEl) to participate in
Furthian quantized stochastic oscillation motion, which turn it into quantum
ShEl. It is performed that this transition is realized by my consideration the
Bohm's quantum potential as a kinetic energy of the forced Furthian quantized
stochastic oscillation motion of the ShEl's well spread elementary electric
charge close to a smooth thin trajectory of a classical LrEl. There exist as an
essential analogy between the Furthian quantum stochastic trembling oscillation
motion and the Brownian classical stochastic trembling motion so and between
the description of their behaviours.
