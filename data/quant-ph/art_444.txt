A C++ library using quantum trajectories to solve quantum master
  equations
Quantum trajectory methods can be used for a wide range of open quantum
systems to solve the master equation by unraveling the density operator
evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in Hilbert space. This C++
class library offers a choice of integration algorithms for three important
unravelings of the master equation. Different physical systems are modeled by
different Hamiltonians and environment operators. The program achieves
flexibility and user friendliness, without sacrificing execution speed, through
the way it represents operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators,
implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom,
can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product Hilbert spaces
with arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic notation is used to
build operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states.
States can be represented in a local moving basis, often leading to dramatic
savings of computing resources. The state and operator classes are very general
and can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms. Only a
rudimentary knowledge of C++ is required to use this package.
