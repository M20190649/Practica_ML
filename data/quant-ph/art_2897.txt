Comment on `Counterfactual entanglement and non-local correlations in
  separable states'
The arguments of Cohen [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 80 (1999)] against the
`ignorance interpretation' of mixed states are questioned. The physical
arguments are shown to be inconsistent and the supporting example illustrates
the opposite of the original statement. The operational difference between two
possible definitions of mixed states is exposed and the inadequacy of one of
them is stressed.
