Quantum Convolutional Error Correction Codes
I report two general methods to construct quantum convolutional codes for
quantum registers with internal $N$ states. Using one of these methods, I
construct a quantum convolutional code of rate 1/4 which is able to correct one
general quantum error for every eight consecutive quantum registers.
