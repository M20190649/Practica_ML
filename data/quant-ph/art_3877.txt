Model for the arrival-time distribution in fluorescence time-of-flight
  experiments
An operational arrival-time distribution is defined as the distribution of
detection times of the first photons emitted by two level atoms in resonance
with a perpendicular laser beam in a time of flight experiment. For ultracold
Cesium atoms the simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical
ideal time-of-arrival distribution of Kijowski.
