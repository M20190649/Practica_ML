Conditional Quantum Dynamics and Logic Gates
Quantum logic gates provide fundamental examples of conditional quantum
dynamics. They could form the building blocks of general quantum information
processing systems which have recently been shown to have many interesting
non--classical properties. We describe a simple quantum logic gate, the quantum
controlled--NOT, and analyse some of its applications. We discuss two possible
physical realisations of the gate; one based on Ramsey atomic interferometry
and the other on the selective driving of optical resonances of two subsystems
undergoing a dipole--dipole interaction.
