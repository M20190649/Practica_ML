Gaussian, Mean Field and Variational Approximation: the Equivalence
We show the equivalence between the three approximation schemes for
self-interacting (1+1)-D scalar field theories. Based on rigorous results of
[1, 2], we are able to prove that the Gaussian approximation is very precise
for certain limits of coupling constants. The $\lambda \phi ^{4}+\sigma \phi
^{2}$ model will be used as a concrete application.
