The myth of the down converted photon
Parametric down conversion (PDC) is widely interpreted in terms of photons,
but, even among supporters of this interpretation, many properties of the
photon pairs have been described as "mind-boggling" and even "absurd". In this
article we argue that a classical description of the light field, taking
account of its vacuum fluctuations, leads us to a consistent and rational
account of all PDC phenomena. "Nonlocality" in quantum optics is simply an
artifact of the Photon Concept. We also predict a new phenomenon, namely the
appearance of a second, or satellite PDC rainbow.
