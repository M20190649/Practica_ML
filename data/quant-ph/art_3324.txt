Persistent entanglement in arrays of interacting particles
We study the entanglement properties of a class of $N$ qubit quantum states
that are generated in arrays of qubits with an Ising-type interaction. These
states contain a large amount of entanglement as given by their Schmidt
measure. They have also a high {\em persistency of entanglement} which means
that $\sim N/2$ qubits have to be measured to disentangle the state. These
states can be regarded as an entanglement resource since one can generate a
family of other multi-particle entangled states such as the generalized GHZ
states of $<N/2$ qubits by simple measurements and classical communication
(LOCC).
