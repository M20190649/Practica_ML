A Quantum Algorithm for finding the Maximum
This paper describes a quantum algorithm for finding the maximum among N
items. The classical method for the same problem takes O(N) steps because we
need to compare two numbers in one step. This algorithm takes O(sqrt(N)) steps
by exploiting the property of quantum states to exist in a superposition of
states and hence performing an operation on a number of elements in one go. A
tight upper bound of 6.8(sqrt(N)) for the number of steps needed using this
algorithm was found. These steps are the number of queries made to the oracle.
