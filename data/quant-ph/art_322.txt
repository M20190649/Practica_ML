Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Need Not Completely Reveal the Error
  Syndrome
Quantum error-correcting codes so far proposed have not worked in the
presence of noise which introduces more than one bit of entropy per qubit sent
through a quantum channel, nor can any code which identifies the complete error
syndrome. We describe a code which does not find the complete error syndrome
and can be used for reliable transmission of quantum information through
channels which add more than one bit of entropy per transmitted bit. In the
case of the depolarizing channel our code can be used in a channel of fidelity
.8096. The best existing code worked only down to .8107.
