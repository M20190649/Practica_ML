Comment on ``Dispersion-Independent High-Visibility Quantum Interference
  ... "
We show in this Comment that the interpretation of experimental data as well
as the theory presented in Atat\"ure et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 618 (2000)]
are incorrect and discuss why such a scheme cannot be used to "recover"
high-visibility quantum interference.
