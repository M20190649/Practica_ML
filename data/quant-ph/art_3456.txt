Orthogonality relations in Quantum Tomography
Quantum estimation of the operators of a system is investigated by analyzing
its Liouville space of operators. In this way it is possible to easily derive
some general characterization for the sets of observables (i.e. the possible
quorums) that are measured for the quantum estimation. In particular we analyze
the reconstruction of operators of spin systems.
