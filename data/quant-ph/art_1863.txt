Quantum codes on a lattice with boundary
A new type of local-check additive quantum code is presented. Qubits are
associated with edges of a 2-dimensional lattice whereas the stabilizer
operators correspond to the faces and the vertices. The boundary of the lattice
consists of alternating pieces with two different types of boundary conditions.
Logical operators are described in terms of relative homology groups.
