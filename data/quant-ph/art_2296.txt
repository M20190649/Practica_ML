Realization of logically labeled effective pure states for bulk quantum
  computation
We report the first use of "logical labeling" to perform a quantum
computation with a room-temperature bulk system. This method entails the
selection of a subsystem which behaves as if it were at zero temperature -
except for a decrease in signal strength - conditioned upon the state of the
remaining system. No averaging over differently prepared molecules is required.
In order to test this concept, we execute a quantum search algorithm in a
subspace of two nuclear spins, labeled by a third spin, using solution nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), and employing a novel choice of reference frame to
uncouple nuclei.
