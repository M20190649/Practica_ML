Exact Solutions to the Schr√∂dinger Equation for the Inverse-Power
  Potential in Two Dimensions
Utilizing an ${\it ansatz}$ for the eigenfunctions, we arrive at an exact
closed form solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the inverse-power
potential, $V(r)=ar^{-4}+br^{-3}+cr^{-2}+dr^{-1}$ in two dimensions, where the
parameters of the potential $a, b, c, d$ satisfy a constraint.
