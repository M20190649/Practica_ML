Geometry of One-Dimensional Wave Propagation
We investigate the geometrical features of one-dimensional wave propagation,
whose dynamics is described by the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz group. We find
many interesting geometrical ingredients such as spinorlike behavior of wave
amplitudes, gauge transformations, Bloch-type equations, and Lorentz-group
Berry phases. We also propose an optical experiment to verify these effects.
