Quantum Anti-Cloning
We derive the transformation for the optimal universal quantum anti-cloner
which produces two anti-parallel outputs for a single input state. The fidelity
is shown to be 2/3 which is same as the measurement fidelity. We consider a
probabilistic quantum anti-cloner and show quantum states can be anti-cloned
exactly with non-zero probability and its efficiency is higher than the
efficiency of distinguishing between the two states.
