A more efficient variant of the Oxford protocol
An alternative presentation of the Oxford purification protocol is obtained
by using dynamical variables. I suggest to introduce the degree of separability
as a purification parameter, where the purified state has a smaller degree of
separability than the initial one. An improved version of the Oxford protocol
is described, in which local unitary transformations optimize each step.
