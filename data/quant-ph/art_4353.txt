Entanglement in squeezed two-level atom
In the previous paper, we adopted the method using quantum mutual entropy to
measure the degree of entanglement in the time development of the
Jaynes-Cummings model. In this paper, we formulate the entanglement in the time
development of the Jaynes-Cummings model with squeezed states, and then show
that the entanglement can be controlled by means of squeezing.
