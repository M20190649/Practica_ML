Measurement and Its Mathematical Scale
It is argued that every measurement is made in a certain scale. The scale in
which present measuments are made is called present scale which gives present
knowledge. Quantities at the limits to present measurement may be observables
in other scales. Cantor's series of infinites is used to describe scales of
measurement. Continuum Hypothesis and Schroedinger Cat are discussed.
