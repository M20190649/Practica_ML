On Schizophrenic Experiences of the Neutron or Why We Should Believe in
  the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Theory
This is a philosophical paper in favor of the Many-Worlds Interpretation
(MWI) of quantum theory. The concept of the ``measure of existence of a world''
is introduced and some difficulties with the issue of probability in the
framework of the MWI are resolved. Brief comparative analyses of the Bohm
theory and the Many-Minds Interpretation are given.
