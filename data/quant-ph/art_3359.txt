Enhanced Quantum Estimation via Purification
We analyze the estimation of a finite ensemble of quantum bits which have
been sent through a depolarizing channel. Instead of using the depolarized
qubits directly, we first apply a purification step and show that this improves
the fidelity of subsequent quantum estimation. Even though we lose some qubits
of our finite ensemble the information is concentrated in the remaining
purified ones.
