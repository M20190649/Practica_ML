Transmission of a Cartesian Frame by a Quantum System
A single quantum system, such as a hydrogen atom, can transmit a Cartesian
coordinate frame (three axes). For this it has to be prepared in a
superposition of states belonging to different irreducible representations of
the rotation group. The algorithm for decoding such a state is presented, and
the fidelity of transmission is evaluated.
