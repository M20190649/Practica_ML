Variational Characterisations of Separability and Entanglement of
  Formation
In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for the characterisation of
separability and entanglement of formation (EoF) of general bipartite states.
These characterisations are of the variational kind, meaning that separability
and EoF are given in terms of a function which is to be minimized over the
manifold of unitary matrices. A major benefit of such a characterisation is
that it directly leads to a numerical procedure for calculating EoF. We present
an efficient minimisation algorithm and an apply it to the bound entangled 3X3
Horodecki states; we show that their EoF is very low and that their distance to
the set of separable states is also very low. Within the same variational
framework we rephrase the results by Wootters (W. Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett.
80, 2245 (1998)) on EoF for 2X2 states and present progress in generalising
these results to higher dimensional systems.
