Teleportation as a quantum computation
An explicit quantum circuit is given to implement quantum teleportation. This
circuit makes teleportation straightforward to anyone who believes that quantum
computation is a reasonable proposition. It could also be genuinely used inside
a quantum computer if teleportation is needed to move quantum information
around. An unusual feature of this circuit is that there are points in the
computation at which the quantum information can be completely disrupted by a
measurement (or some types of interaction with the environment) without ill
effects: the same final result is obtained whether or not these measurements
takes place.
