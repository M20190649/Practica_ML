Convergences in the Measurement Problem in Quantum Mechanics
This paper presents arguments purporting to show that von Neumann's
description of the measurement process in quantum mechanics has a modern day
version in the decoherence approach. We claim that this approach and the de
Broglie-Bohm theory emerges from Bohr's interpretation and are therefore
obliged to deal with some obscures ideas which were antecipated, explicitly or
implicitly and carefully circumvented, by Bohr.
