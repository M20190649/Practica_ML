Achievable rates for the Gaussian quantum channel
We study the properties of quantum stabilizer codes that embed a
finite-dimensional protected code space in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space. The stabilizer group of such a code is associated with a symplectically
integral lattice in the phase space of 2N canonical variables. From the
existence of symplectically integral lattices with suitable properties, we
infer a lower bound on the quantum capacity of the Gaussian quantum channel
that matches the one-shot coherent information optimized over Gaussian input
states.
