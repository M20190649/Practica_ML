Mixedness in Bell-violation vs. Entanglement of Formation
Recently Munro, Nemoto and White (The Bell Inequality: A measure of
Entanglement?, quant-ph/0102119) tried to indicate that the reason behind a
state rho having higher amount of entanglement (as quantified by the
entanglement of formation) than a state eta, but producing the same amount of
Bell-violation, is due to the fact that the amount of mixedness (as quantified
by the linearised entropy) in rho is higher than that in eta. We counter their
argument with examples. We extend these considerations to the von Neumann
entropy. Our results suggest that the reason as to why equal amount of
Bell-violation requires different amounts of entanglement cannot, at least, be
explained by mixedness alone.
