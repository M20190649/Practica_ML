Experimental Demonstration of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Correlations
  Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) effect provides an example of quantum
correlations that cannot be explained by classical local hidden variables. This
paper reports on the experimental realization of GHZ correlations using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR experiment differs from the originally
proposed GHZ experiment in several ways: it is performed on mixed states rather
than pure states; and instead of being widely separated, the spins on which it
is performed are all located in the same molecule. As a result, the NMR version
of the GHZ experiment cannot entirely rule out classical local hidden
variables. It nonetheless provides an unambiguous demonstration of the
"paradoxical" GHZ correlations, and shows that any classical hidden variables
must communicate by non-standard and previously undetected forces. The NMR
demonstration of GHZ correlations shows the power of NMR quantum information
processing techniques for demonstrating fundamental effects in quantum
mechanics.
