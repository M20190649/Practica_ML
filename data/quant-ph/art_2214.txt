Speedup of iterated quantum search by parallel performance
Given a sequence $f_1 (x_1), f_2 (x_1, x_2), ..., f_k (x_1, ..., x_k)$ of
Boolean functions, each of which $f_i$ takes the value 1 in a single point of
the form $x_1^0, x_2^0, ..., x_i^0, i=1,2,..., k$. A length of all $x_i^0$ is
$n, N=2^n$. It is shown how to find $x_k^0 (k\geq 2)$ using
\frac{k\pi\sqrt{N}}{4\sqrt{2}}$ simultaneous evaluations of functions of the
form $f_i, f_{i+1}$ with an error probability of order $k/\sqrt{N}$ which is
$\sqrt{2}$ times as fast as by the $k$ sequential applications of Grover
algorithm for the quantum search. Evolutions of amplitudes in parallel quantum
computations are approximated by systems of linear differential equations. Some
advantage of simultaneous evaluations of all $f_1 ,... f_k$ are discussed.
