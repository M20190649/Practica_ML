Lindblad Evolution and Stochasticity: the Case of a Two-Level System
We consider the simple hypothesis of letting quantum systems have an inherent
random nature. Using well-known stochastic methods we thus derive a stochastic
evolution operator which let us define a stochastic density operator whose
expectation value under certain conditions satisfies a Lindblad equation. As
natural consequences of the former assumption decoherence and spontaneous
emission processes are obtained under the same conceptual scheme. A temptative
solution for the preferred basis problem is suggested. All this is illustrated
with a comprehensive study of a two-level quantum system evolution.
