Quantum Langevin Equations and Stability
Different quantum Langevin equations obtained by coupling a particle to a
field are examined. Instabilities or violations of causality affect the motion
of a point charge linearly coupled to the electromagnetic field. In contrast,
coupling a scatterer with a reflection cut-off to radiation pressure leads to
stable and causal motions. The radiative reaction force exerted on a scatterer,
and hence its quasistatic mass, depend on the field state. Explicit expressions
for a particle scattering a thermal field in a two dimensional space-time are
given.
