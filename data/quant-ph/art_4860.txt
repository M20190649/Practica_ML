Asymptotic behaviour of the probability density in one dimension
We demonstrate that the probability density of a quantum state moving freely
in one dimension may decay faster than 1/t. Inverse quadratic and cubic
dependences are illustrated with analytically solvable examples. Decays faster
than 1/t allow the existence of dwell times and delay times.
