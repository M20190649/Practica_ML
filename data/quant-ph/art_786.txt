Timing and Other Artifacts in EPR Experiments
Re-evaluation of the evidence (some of it unpublished) shows that
experimenters conducting Einstein-Podolsky-Bohm (EPR) experiments may have been
deceived by various pre-conceptions and artifacts. False or unproven
assumptions were made regarding, in some cases, fair sampling, in others
timing, accidental coincidences and enhancement. Realist possibilities,
assuming a purely wave model of light, are presented heuristically, and
suggestions given for fruitful lines of research. Quantum Mechanics can be
proved false, but Bell tests have turned out to be unsuitable for the task.
