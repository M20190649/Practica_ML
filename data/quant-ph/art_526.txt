Coherent States and the Measurement Problem
The convenience of coherent state representation is discussed from the
viewpoint of what is in a broad sense called the measurement problem in quantum
mechanics. Standard quantum theory in coherent state representation is
intrinsically related to a number of earlier concepts conciliating quantum and
classical processes. From a natural statistical interpretation, free of
collapses or measurements, the usual von Neumann-L\"uders collapse as well as
its quantum state diffusion interpretation follow. In particular, a theory of
coupled quantum and classical dynamics arises, containing the fluctuation
corrections versus the fenomenological mean-field theories.
