Cloning and quantum computation
We discuss how quantum information distribution can improve the performance
of some quantum computation tasks. This distribution can be naturally
implemented with different types of quantum cloning procedures. We give two
examples of tasks for which cloning provides some enhancement in performance,
and briefly discuss possible extensions of the idea.
