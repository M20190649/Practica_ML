A posteriori teleportation ?
Braunstein and Kimble observe correctly that, in the Innsbruck experiment,
Nature 390, 575 (1997), one does not always observe a teleported photon
conditioned on a coincidence recording at the Bell-state analyser. However,
when a teleported photon appears, it has all the properties required by the
teleportation protocol.
