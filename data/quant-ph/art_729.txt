Pumping of twin-trap Bose-Einstein condensates
We consider extensions of the twin-trap Bose-Einstein condensate system of
Javaneinen and Yoo [Phys. Rev. Lett., 76, 161--164 (1996)] to include pumping
and output couplers. Such a system permits a continual outflow of two beams of
atoms with a relative phase coherence maintained by the detection process. We
study this system for two forms of thermal pumping, both with and without the
influence of inter-atomic collisions. We also examine the effects of pumping on
the phenomenon of collapses and revivals of the relative phase between the
condensates.
