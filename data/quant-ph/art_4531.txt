Tests of Bell Inequalities
According to recent reports, the last loopholes in testing Bell's inequality
are closed. It is argued that the really important task in this field has not
been tackled yet and that the leading experiments claiming to close locality
and detection efficiency loopholes, although making a very significant
progress, have conceptual drawbacks. The important task is constructing quantum
devices which will allow winning games of certain correlated replies against
any classical team. A novel game of this type is proposed.
