Radiation Pressure Approach to the Repulsive Casimir Force
We study the Casimir force between a perfectly conducting and an infinitely
permeable plate with the radiation pressure approach. This method illustrates
how a repulsive force arises as a consequence of the redistribution of the
vacuum-field modes corresponding to specific boundary conditions. We discuss
also how the method of the zero-point radiation pressure follows from QED.
