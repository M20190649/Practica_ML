Existence of the Wigner function with correct marginal distributions
  along tilted lines on a lattice
In order to determine the Wigner function uniquely, we introduce a new
condition which ensures that the Wigner function has correct marginal
distributions along tilted lines. For a system in $N$ dimensional Hilbert
space, whose "phase space" is a lattice with $N^2$ sites, we get different
results depending on whether $N$ is odd or even. Under the new condition, the
Wigner function is determined if $N$ is an odd number, but it does not exist if
$N$ is even.
