Exploiting exciton-exciton interactions in semiconductor quantum dots
  for quantum-information processing
We propose an all-optical implementation of quantum-information processing in
semiconductor quantum dots, where electron-hole excitations (excitons) serve as
the computational degrees of freedom (qubits). We show that the strong dot
confinement leads to an overall enhancement of Coulomb correlations and to a
strong renormalization of the excitonic states, which can be exploited for
performing conditional and unconditional qubit operations.
