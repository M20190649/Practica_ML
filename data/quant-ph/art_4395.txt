Four-path interference and uncertainty principle in photodetachment
  microscopy
We study the quantal motion of electrons emitted by a pointlike monochromatic
isotropic source into parallel uniform electric and magnetic fields. The
two-path interference pattern in the emerging electron wave due to the electric
force is modified by the magnetic lens effect which periodically focuses the
beam into narrow filaments along the symmetry axis. There, four classical paths
interfere. With increasing electron energy, the current distribution changes
from a quantum regime governed by the uncertainty principle, to an intricate
spatial pattern that yields to a semiclassical analysis.
