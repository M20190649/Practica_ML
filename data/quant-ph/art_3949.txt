Vacuum Induced Coherences in Radiatively Coupled Multilevel Systems
We show that radiative coupling between two multilevel atoms having
near-degenerate states can produce new interference effects in spontaneous
emission. We explicitly demonstrate this possibility by considering two
identical V systems each having a pair of transition dipole matrix elements
which are orthogonal to each other. We discuss in detail the origin of the new
interference terms and their consequences. Such terms lead to the evolution of
certain coherences and excitations which would not occur otherwise. The special
choice of the orientation of the transition dipole matrix elements enables us
to illustrate the significance of vacuum induced coherence in multi-atom
multilevel systems. These coherences can be significant in energy transfer
studies.
