Realistic experiments for measuring the wave function of a single
  particle
We suggest scattering experiments which implement the concept of ``protective
measurements'' allowing the measurement of the complete wave function even when
only one quantum system (rather than an ensemble) is available. Such scattering
experiments require massive, slow, projectiles with kinetic energies lower than
the first excitation of the system in question. The results of such experiments
can have a (probabilistic) distribution (as is the case when the Born
approximation for the scattering is valid) or be deterministic (in a
semi-classical limit).
