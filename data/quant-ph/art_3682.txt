Numerical Experiments on The Capacity of Quantum Channel with Entangled
  Input States
The capacity of quantum channel with product input states was formulated by
the quantum coding theorem. However, whether entangled input states can enhance
the quantum channel is still open. It turns out that this problem is reduced to
aspecial case of the more general problem whether the capacity of product
quantum channel exhibits additivity. In the present study, we apply one of the
quantum Arimoto-Blahut type algorithms to the latter problem. The results
suggest that the additivity of product quantum channel capacity always holds
and that entangled input states cannot enhance the quantum channel capacity.
