An Operator Formulation of Classical Mechanics and Semiclassical Limit
The generalized h-dependent operator algebra is defined ($0\leq h \leq h_o$).
For h= h_o it becomes equivalent to the quantum mechanical algebra of
observables and for h=0 it is equivalent to the classical one. We show this by
proposing how the main features of both mechanics can be defined in operator
form.
