Quantum measurements with a quantum computer
We present a scheme in which an ion trap quantum computer can be used to make
arbitrarily accurate measurements of the quadrature phase variables for the
collective vibrational motion of the ion. The electronic states of the ion
become the `apparatus', and the method is based on regarding the `apparatus' as
a quantum computer register which can be prepared in appropriate states by
running a Fourier transform algorithm on the data stored within it. The
resolution of the measurement rises exponentially with the number of ions used.
