Algebraic measures of entanglement
We study the rank of a general tensor $u$ in a tensor product $H_1\ot...\ot
H_k$. The rank of $u$ is the minimal number $p$ of pure states $v_1,...,v_p$
such that $u$ is a linear combination of the $v_j$'s. This rank is an algebraic
measure of the degree of entanglement of $u$. Motivated by quantum computation,
we completely describe the rank of an arbitrary tensor in $(\C^2)^{\ot 3}$ and
give normal forms for tensor states up to local unitary transformations. We
also obtain partial results for $(\C^2)^{\ot 4}$; in particular, we show that
the maximal rank of a tensor in $(\C^2)^{\ot 4}$ is equal to 4.
