Consistent histories and relativistic invariance in the modal
  interpretation of quantum mechanics
Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics assign definite properties to
physical systems and specify single-time joint probabilities of these
properties. We show that a natural extension, applying to properties at several
times, can be given if a decoherence condition is satisfied. This extension
defines "consistent histories" of modal properties. We suggest a new form of
the modal scheme, that offers prospects of a more general applicability of the
histories concept. Finally, we discuss a possible way of applying these ideas
to relativistic quantum field theory.
