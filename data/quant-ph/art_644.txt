Comment on ``An Evolutionary Picture for Quantum Physics'' by Rudolf
  Haag
Widespread unjustified views on the role of the observer, the individuality
of quantum processes, the relation between decoherence and irreversibility,
Bell's quest for `beables', the direction of time, and the concept of
experience are revealed, whereby a better understanding is achieved of what the
evolutionary picture is all about and what is regarded as missing in already
existing realistic pictures.
