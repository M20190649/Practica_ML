Constructing quantum error-correcting codes for p^m-state systems from
  classical error-correcting codes
We generalize the construction of quantum error-correcting codes from
GF(4)-linear codes by Calderbank et al. to p^m-state systems. Then we show how
to determine the error from a syndrome. Finally we discuss a systematic
construction of quantum codes with efficient decoding algorithms.
