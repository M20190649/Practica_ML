Nonclassicality and the concept of local constraints on the photon
  number distribution
We exploit results from the classical Stieltjes moment problem to bring out
the totality of all the information regarding phase insensitive nonclassicality
of a state as captured by the photon number distribution p_n. Central to our
approach is the realization that n !p_n constitutes the sequence of moments of
a (quasi) probability distribution, notwithstanding the fact that p_n can by
itself be regarded as a probability distribution. This leads to classicality
restrictions on p_n that are local in n involving p_n's for only a small number
of consecutive n's, enabling a critical examination of the conjecture that
oscillation in p_n is a signature of nonclassicality.
