Type-II parametric down conversion in the Wigner-function formalism.
  Entanglement and Bell's inequalities
We continue the analysis of our previous articles which were devoted to
type-I parametric down conversion, the extension to type-II being
straightforward. We show that entanglement, in the Wigner representation, is
just a correlation that involves both signal and vacuum fluctuations. An
analysis of the detection process opens the way to a complete description of
parametric down conversion in terms of pure Maxwell electromagnetic waves.
