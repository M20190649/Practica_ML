Quantum Superposition States of Bose-Einstein Condensates
We propose a scheme to create a macroscopic ``Sch\"odinger cat'' state formed
by two interacting Bose condensates. In analogy with quantum optics, where the
control and engineering of quantum states can be maintained to a large extend,
we consider the present scheme to be an example of quantum atom optics at work.
