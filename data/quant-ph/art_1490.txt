Is the EPR paradox really a paradox?
The EPR paradox and the meaning of the Bell inequality are discussed. It is
shown that considering the quantum objects as carrying with them ''instruction
kits'' telling them what to do when meeting a measurement apparatus any paradox
disappears. In this view the quantum state is characterized by the prescribed
behaviour rather than by the specific value a parameter assumes as a result of
an interaction.
