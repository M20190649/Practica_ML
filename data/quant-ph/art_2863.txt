The stochastic limit of quantum spin systems
The stochastic limit for the system of spins interacting with a boson field
is investigated. In the finite volume an application of the stochastic golden
rule shows that in the limit the dynamics of a quantum system is described by a
quantum white noise equation that after taking of normal order is equivalent to
quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE). For the quantum Langevin
equation the dynamics is well defined and is a quantum flow on the infinite
lattice system.
