Evaluating capacities of Bosonic Gaussian channels
We show how to compute or at least to estimate various capacity-related
quantities for Bosonic Gaussian channels. Among these are the coherent
information, the entanglement assisted classical capacity, the one-shot
classical capacity, and a new quantity involving the transpose operation, shown
to be a general upper bound on the quantum capacity, even allowing for finite
errors. All bounds are explicitly evaluated for the case of a one-mode channel
with attenuation/amplification and classical noise.
