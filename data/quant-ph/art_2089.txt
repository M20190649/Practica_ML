Statistics of the single mode light in the transparent medium with cubic
  nonlinearity
The quantum statistics of the light in the transparent medium with cubic
nonlinearity is considered. Two types of transparent media are treated, namely,
the cold transparent medium with a ground working level and the inversion-free
medium with the lasing levels of the same population. The spectra of light
fluctuation are found on the basis of both Scully-Lamb and Haken theories. The
conditions for the use of effective Hamiltonian are determined. Basing on the
exact solution of the Fokker-Plank equation for the Glauber-Sudarshan
P-function the inversion-free medium with cubic nonlinearity is shown to be the
source of spontaneous radiation with non-Gaussian statistics.
