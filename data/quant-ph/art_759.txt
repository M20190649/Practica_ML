A Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment for mixed states
This paper shows how the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment, which
demonstrates the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics, can be performed using
nuclear magnetic resonance on spins in molecules at finite temperature. The use
of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques allows the experiment to uncover the
nonlocality not just of special GHZ states, but of arbitrary three particle
states.
