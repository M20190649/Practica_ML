Entanglement enhanced information transmission over a quantum channel
  with correlated noise
We show that entanglement is a useful resource to enhance the mutual
information of the depolarizing channel when the noise on consecutive uses of
the channel has some partial correlations. We obtain a threshold in the degree
of memory, depending on the shrinking factor of the channel, above which a
higher amount of classical information is transmitted with entangled signals.
