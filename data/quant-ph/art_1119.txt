A new stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics
The reinterpretation of quantum mechanical formalism in terms of a classical
model with a continuous material "$\Psi$-field" acting upon a point-like
particle which is subjected to large friction and random forces is proposed.
This model gives a mechanism for sudden "quantum jumps" and provides a simple
explanation of "Schr\"odinger Cat" phenomena.
