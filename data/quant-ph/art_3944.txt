Semiclassical theory of cavity-assisted atom cooling
We present a systematic semiclassical model for the simulation of the
dynamics of a single two-level atom strongly coupled to a driven high-finesse
optical cavity. From the Fokker-Planck equation of the combined atom-field
Wigner function we derive stochastic differential equations for the atomic
motion and the cavity field. The corresponding noise sources exhibit strong
correlations between the atomic momentum fluctuations and the noise in the
phase quadrature of the cavity field. The model provides an effective tool to
investigate localisation effects as well as cooling and trapping times. In
addition, we can continuously study the transition from a few photon quantum
field to the classical limit of a large coherent field amplitude.
