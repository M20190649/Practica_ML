Two dimensional nonlinear dynamics of evanescent-wave guided atoms in
  hollow fiber
We describe the classical and quantum two dimensional nonlinear dynamics of
large blue-detuned eveanescent-wave guiding cold atoms in hollow fiber. We show
that chaotic dynamics exists for classic dynamics, when the intensity of the
beam is periodically modulated. The two dimensional distributions of atoms in
(x,y) plane are simulated. We show that the atoms will accumulate on several
annular regions when the system enters a regime of global chaos. Our simulation
shows that, when the atomic flux is very small, a similar distribution will be
obtained if we detect the atomic distribution once each the modualtion period
and integrate the signals.
  For quantum dynamics, quantum collapses and revivals appear . For
periodically modulated optical potential, the variance of atomic position will
be supressed compared to the no modulation case. The atomic angular momentum
will influnce the evolution of wave function in two dimensional quantum system
of hollow fiber.
