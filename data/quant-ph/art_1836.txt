Superrevivals in the quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a finite
  square well potential
We examine the revival features in wave packet dynamics of a particle
confined in a finite square well potential. The possibility of tunneling
modifies the revival pattern as compared to an infinite square well potential.
We study the dependence of the revival times on the depth of the square well
and predict the existence of superrevivals. The nature of these superrevivals
is compared with similar features seen in the dynamics of wavepackets in an
anharmonic oscillator potential.
