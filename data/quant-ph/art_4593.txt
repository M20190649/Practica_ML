From Geometry to Quantum Computation
The aim of this paper is to introduce our idea of Holonomic Quantum
Computation (Computer). Our model is based on both harmonic oscillators and
non-linear quantum optics, not on spins of usual quantum computation and our
method is moreover completely geometrical. We hope that therefore our model may
be strong for decoherence.
