Quantum teleportation with squeezed vacuum states
We show how the partial entanglement inherent in a two mode squeezed vacuum
state admits two different teleportation protocols. These two protocols refer
to the different kinds of joint measurements that may be made by the sender.
One protocol is the recently implemented quadrature phase approach of
Braunstein and Kimble[Phys. Rev. Lett.{\bf 80}, 869 (1998)]. The other is based
on recognising that a two mode squeezed vacuum state is also entangled with
respect to photon number difference and phase sum. We show that this protocol
can also realise teleportation, however limitations can arise due to the fact
that the photon number spectrum is bounded from below by zero. Our examples
show that a given entanglement resource may admit more than a single
teleportation protocol and the question then arises as to what is the optimum
protocol in the general case.
