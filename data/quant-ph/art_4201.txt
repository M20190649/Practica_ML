Stimulated emission with a non-equilibrium state of radiation
The stimulated emission from an atom interacting with radiation in
non-equilibrium state is considered. The stochastic limit, applied to the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian describing the interaction, shows that the state
of atoms, driven by some non-equilibrium state of the field approaches a
stationary state which can continuously emit photon, unlike the case with an
equilibrium state.
