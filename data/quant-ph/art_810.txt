Hamiltonians for Quantum Computing
We argue that the analog nature of quantum computing makes the usual design
approach of constructing complicated logical operations from many simple gates
inappropriate. Instead, we propose to design multi-spin quantum gates in which
the input and output two-state systems (spins) are not necessarily identical.
We outline the design criteria for such devices and then review recent results
for single-unit Hamiltonians that accomplish the NOT and XOR functions.
