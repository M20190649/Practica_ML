Performing Quantum Measurement in Suitably Entangled States Originates
  the Quantum Computation Speed Up
We introduce a local concept of speed-up applicable to intermediate stages of
a quantum algorithm. We use it to analyse the complementary roles played by
quantum parallel computation and quantum measurement in yielding the speed-up.
A severe conflict between there being a speed-up and the many worlds
interpretation is highlighted.
