Time-of-arrival distribution for arbitrary potentials and Wigner's
  time-energy uncertainty relation
A realization of the concept of "crossing state" invoked, but not
implemented, by Wigner, allows to advance in two important aspects of the time
of arrival in quantum mechanics: (i) For free motion, we find that the
limitations described by Aharonov et al. in Phys. Rev. A 57, 4130 (1998) for
the time-of-arrival uncertainty at low energies for certain mesurement models
are in fact already present in the intrinsic time-of-arrival distribution of
Kijowski; (ii) We have also found a covariant generalization of this
distribution for arbitrary potentials and positions.
