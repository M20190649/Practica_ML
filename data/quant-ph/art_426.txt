Data Compression for Quantum Code
The general scheme of data compression using the quantum noiseless coding
theorem of Schumacher is dicussed for general quantum sources. When the Hilbert
space of the quantum source is decomposable into orthogonal subspaces, one can
first perform classical data compression before performing the quantum data
compression for individual subspaces. For minimizing the resource in quantum
coding, a general parameterization of the dimensions in the Jozsa-Schumacher
quantum data compression scheme is presented.
