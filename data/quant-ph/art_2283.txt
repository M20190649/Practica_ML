No Signalling and Probabilistic Quantum Cloning
We show that the condition of no faster-than-light signalling restricts the
number of quantum states that can be cloned in a given Hilbert space. This
condition leads to the constraints on a probabilistic quantum cloning machine
(PQCM) recently found by Duan and Guo.
