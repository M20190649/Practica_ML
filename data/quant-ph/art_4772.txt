Particle localization and the Notion of Einstein Causality
The notion of Einstein causality, i.e. the limiting role of the velocity of
light in the transmission of signals, is discussed. It is pointed out that
Nimtz and coworkers use the notion of signal velocity in a different sense from
Einstein and that their experimental results are in full agreement with
Einstein causality in its ordinary sense. We also show that under quite general
assumptions instantaneous spreading of particle localization occurs in quantum
theory, relativistic or not, with fields or without. We discuss if this affects
Einstein causality.
