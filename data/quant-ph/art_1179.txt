The zeropoint field - no longer a ghost
We develop a local realist analysis of parametric down conversion, based on
the recognition that the pump field, instead of down converting spontaneously,
does so through its nonlinear coupling with a real zeropoint, or "vacuum"
electromagnetic field. The theory leads tothe prediction of a new phenomenon -
that, in addition to the main down-conversion rainbow, there is a satellite
rainbow, whose intensity is about 3 per cent of the main one. Confirmation of
this prediction will call seriously into question the current description of
the light field in terms of photons.
