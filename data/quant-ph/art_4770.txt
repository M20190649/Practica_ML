Counterfactual Statements and Weak Measurements: an Experimental
  Proposal
A recent analysis [quant-ph/0104062] suggests that weak measurements can be
used to give observational meaning to counterfactual reasoning in quantum
physics. A weak measurement is predicted to assign a negative unit population
to a specific state in an interferometric Gedankenexperiment proposed by Hardy.
We propose an experimental implementation with trapped ions of the
Gedankenexperiment and of the weak measurement. In our standard quantum
mechanical analysis of the proposal no states have negative population, but we
identify the registration of a negative population by particles being displaced
on average in the direction opposite to a force acting upon them.
