A New Approach to Locality and Causality
In the light of some recent results, it is argued that usual concepts of
causality and locality are approximations valid at scales greater than the
Compton wavelength and corresponding time scales. It follows that the "spooky"
non-locality of Quantum Mechanics is not really so and infact is perfectly
consistent with a recently discussed holistic model, which again is
corroborated by latest astrophysical and cosmological observations. This
approach also provides a rationale for the origin of the metric and points to,
what may be called a space time quantization which may be, ultimately,
fundamental.
