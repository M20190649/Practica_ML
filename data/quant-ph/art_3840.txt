Quantum phase retrieval of a Rydberg wave packet using a half-cycle
  pulse
A terahertz half-cycle pulse was used to retrieve information stored as
quantum phase in an $N$-state Rydberg atom data register. The register was
prepared as a wave packet with one state phase-reversed from the others (the
"marked bit"). A half-cycle pulse then drove a significant portion of the
electron probability into the flipped state via multimode interference.
