Comment on "Conceptual Inadequacy of Shannon Information ..." by C.
  Brukner and A. Zeilinger
It is pointed out that the case for Shannon entropy and von Neumann entropy,
as measures of uncertainty in quantum mechanics, is not as bleak as suggested
in quant-ph/0006087. The main argument of the latter is based on one particular
interpretation of Shannon's H-function (related to consecutive measurements),
and is shown explicitly to fail for other physical interpretations. Further, it
is shown that Shannon and von Neumann entropies have in fact a common
fundamental significance, connected to the existence of a unique geometric
measure of uncertainty for classical and quantum ensembles. Some new properties
of the ``total information'' measure proposed in quant-ph/0006087 are also
given.
