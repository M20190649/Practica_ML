Quantum Dense Coding Exploiting Bright EPR Beam
Highly efficient quantum dense coding for continuous variables has been
experimentally accomplished by means of exploiting bright EPR beam with
anticorrelation of amplitude quadratures and correlation of phase quadratures,
which is generated from a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier operating
in the state of deamplification. Two bits of classical information are encoded
on two quadratures of a half of bright EPR beam at the sender Alice and
transmitted to the receiver Bob via one qubit of the shared quantum state after
encoding. The amplitude and phase signals are simultaneously decoded with the
other half of EPR beam by the direct measurement of the Bell-state at Bob. The
signal to noise ratios of the simultaneously measured amplitude and phase
signals are improved 5.4dB and 4.8dB with respect to that of the shot noise
limit respectively. A high degree of immunity to unauthorized eavesdropping of
the presented quantum communication scheme is experimentally demonstrated.
