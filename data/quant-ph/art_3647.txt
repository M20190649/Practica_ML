Bell State Preparation using Pulsed Non-Degenerate Two-Photon
  Entanglement
We report a novel Bell state preparation experiment. High-purity Bell states
are prepared by using femtosecond pulse pumped \emph{nondegenerate} collinear
spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The use of femtosecond pump pulse {\em
does not} result in reduction of quantum interference visibility in our scheme
in which post-selection of amplitudes and other traditional mechanisms, such
as, using thin nonlinear crystals or narrow-band spectral filters are not used.
Another distinct feature of this scheme is that the pump, the signal, and the
idler wavelengths are all distinguishable, which is very useful for quantum
communications.
