Reliable teleportation in trapped ions
We study a method for the implementation of a reliable teleportation protocol
(theoretically, 100% of success) of internal states in trapped ions. The
generation of the quantum channel (any of four Bell states) may be done
respecting technical limitations on individual addressing and without claiming
the Lamb-Dicke regime. An adequate Bell analyzer, that transforms unitarily the
Bell basis into a completely disentangled one, is considered. Probable sources
of error and fidelity estimations of the teleportation process are studied.
Finally, we discuss experimental issues, proposing a scenario in which the
present scheme could be implemented.
