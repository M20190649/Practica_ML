Decoherence-induced wave packet splitting
We provide an intuitive interpretation of the optical Stern-Gerlach effect
(OSGE) in the dressed-state point of view. We also analyze the effect of atomic
damping in an experiment on the OSGE. We show that the atomic damping also
causes the wave packet splitting, in a non-mechanical fashion, as opposed to
the coherent process that is mechanical.
