Quantum error correction of dephasing in 3 qubits
We show how to perform error correction of single qubit dephasing by encoding
a single qubit into a minimum of three. This may be performed in a manner
closely analogous to classical error correction schemes. Further, the resulting
quantum error correction schemes are trivially generalized to the minimal
encoding of arbitrarily many qubits so as to allow for multiqubit dephasing
correction under the sole condition that the environment acts independently on
each qubit.
