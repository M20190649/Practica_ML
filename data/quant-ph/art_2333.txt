Realization of a 5-bit NMR Quantum Computer Using a New Molecular
  Architecture
We demonstrate a five-bit nuclear-magnetic-resonance quantum computer that
distinguishes among various functions on four bits, making use of quantum
parallelism. Its construction draws on the recognition of the sufficiency of
linear coupling along a chain of nuclear spins, the synthesis of a suitably
coupled molecule, and the use of a multi-channel spectrometer.
