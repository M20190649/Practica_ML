Fast versions of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm
We present fast and highly parallelized versions of Shor's algorithm. With a
sizable quantum computer it would then be possible to factor numbers with
millions of digits. The main algorithm presented here uses FFT-based fast
integer multiplication. The quick reader can just read the introduction and the
``Results'' section.
