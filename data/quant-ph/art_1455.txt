Measuring quantum optical Hamiltonians
We show how recent state-reconstruction techniques can be used to determine
the Hamiltonian of an optical device that evolves the quantum state of
radiation. A simple experimental setup is proposed for measuring the
Liouvillian of phase-insensitive devices. The feasibility of the method with
current technology is demonstrated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulated
experiments.
