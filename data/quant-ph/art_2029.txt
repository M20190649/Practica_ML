Entanglement and State Preparation
When a subset of particles in an entangled state is measured, the state of
the subset of unmeasured particles is determined by the outcome of the
measurement. This first measurement may be thought of as a state preparation
for the remaining particles. In this paper, we examine how the duration of the
first measurement effects the state of the unmeasured subsystem. The state of
the unmeasured subsytem will be a pure or mixed state depending on the nature
of the measurement.
  In the case of quantum teleportation we show that there is an eigenvalue
equation which must be satisfied for accurate teleportation. This equation
provides a limitation to the states that can be accurately teleported.
