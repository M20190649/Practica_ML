Quantum State Reconstruction of a Bose-Einstein Condensate
We propose a tomographic scheme to reconstruct the quantum state of a
Bose-Einstein condensate, exploiting the radiation field as a probe and
considering the atomic internal degrees of freedom. The density matrix in the
number state basis can be directly retrieved from the atom counting
probabilities.
