High Efficiency Interaction-free Measurement from Continuous Wave
  Multi-beam Interference
A new method for high efficiency interaction-free measurement is presented.
Selective transmission of multiple beam interference is used to generate a
continuous wave target beam with an irradiance level ~1% that of a reference
beam. When the target beam is unobstructed by a potentially interposed object,
the resultant measured interference visibility of 0.86 with the reference beam
significantly exceeds the classically predicted irradiance-based visibility of
0.17 and provides a methodology for ~100% interaction-free measurement with a
continuous wave beam.
