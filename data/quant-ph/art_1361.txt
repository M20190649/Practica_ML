Self-homodyne tomography of a twin-beam state
A self-homodyne detection scheme is proposed to perform two-mode tomography
on a twin-beam state at the output of a nondegenerate optical parametric
amplifier. This scheme has been devised to improve the matching between the
local oscillator and the signal modes, which is the main limitation to the
overall quantum efficiency in conventional homodyning. The feasibility of the
measurement is analyzed on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations, studying the
effect of non-unit quantum efficiency on detection of the correlation and the
total photon-number oscillations of the twin-beam state.
