On quantum coding for ensembles of mixed states
We consider the problem of optimal asymptotically faithful compression for
ensembles of mixed quantum states. Although the optimal rate is unknown, we
prove upper and lower bounds and describe a series of illustrative examples of
compression of mixed states. We also discuss a classical analogue of the
problem.
