The speed of quantum information and the preferred frame: analysis of
  experimental data
The results of EPR experiments performed in Geneva are analyzed in the frame
of the cosmic microwave background radiation, generally considered as a good
candidate for playing the role of preferred frame. We set a lower bound for the
speed of quantum information in this frame at 1.5 x 10^4 c.
