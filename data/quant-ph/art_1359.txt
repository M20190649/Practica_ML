A Dynamical Mechanism for the Selection of Physical States in `Geometric
  Quantization Schemes'
Geometric quantization procedures go usually through an extension of the
original theory (pre-quantization) and a subsequent reduction (selection of the
physical states). In this context we describe a full geometrical mechanism
which provides dynamically the desired reduction.
