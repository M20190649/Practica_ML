Teleportation of rotations and receiver-encoded secret sharing
We show how an arbitrary qubit rotation can be teleported, albeit
probabilistically, using 1 e-bit of entanglement and one classical bit. We use
this to present a scheme for implementing quantum secret sharing. The scheme
operates essentially by sending a "secret" rotated qubit of information to
several users, who need to cooperate in order to recover the original qubit.
