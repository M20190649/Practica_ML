Information, Relative Entropy of Entanglement and Irreversibility
Previously proposed measures of entanglement, such as entanglement of
formation and assistance, are shown to be special cases of the relative entropy
of entanglement. The difference between these measures for an ensemble of mixed
states is shown to depend on the availability of classical information about
particular members of the ensemble. Based on this, relations between relative
entropy of entanglement and mutual information are derived.
