Quantum Information Theory - A Quantum Bayesian Net Perspective
The main goal of this paper is to give a pedagogical introduction to Quantum
Information Theory-to do this in a new way, using network diagrams called
Quantum Bayesian Nets. A lesser goal of the paper is to propose a few new
ideas, such as associating with each quantum Bayesian net a very useful density
matrix that we call the meta density matrix.
