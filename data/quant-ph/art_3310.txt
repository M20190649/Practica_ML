Quantum Codes for Controlling Coherent Evolution
Control over spin dynamics has been obtained in NMR via coherent averaging,
which is implemented through a sequence of RF pulses, and via quantum codes
which can protect against incoherent evolution. Here, we discuss the design and
implementation of quantum codes to protect against coherent evolution. A
detailed example is given of a quantum code for protecting two data qubits from
evolution under a weak coupling (Ising) term in the Hamiltonian, using an
``isolated'' ancilla which does not evolve on the experimental time scale. The
code is realized in a three-spin system by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy on
13C-labelled alanine, and tested for two initial states. It is also shown that
for coherent evolution and isolated ancillae, codes exist that do not require
the ancillae to initially be in a (pseudo-)pure state. Finally, it is shown
that even with non-isolated ancillae quantum codes exist which can protect
against evolution under weak coupling. An example is presented for a six qubit
code that protects two data spins to first order.
