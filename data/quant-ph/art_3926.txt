On a Physical Metatheory of Consciousness
We show that the modern quantum mechanics, and particularly the theory of
decoherence, allows for formulating a sort of a physical metatheory of
consciousness. Particularly, the analysis of the necessary conditions for the
occurrence of decoherence, along with the hypothesis that consciousness bears
(more-or-less) well definable physical origin, leads to a wider physical
picture naturally involving consciousness. This can be considered as a sort of
a psycho-physical parallelism, but on rather wide scales bearing some
cosmological relevance.
