Parametric image amplification in optical cavities
We show the possibility of noiseless amplification of an optical image in
cavities containing a parametric oscillator. We consider a confocal ring cavity
with plane mirrors and compare with the case of planar cavity. In the latter
case the system operates with severe spatial limitations, while in the confocal
case, there is the possibility of preserving the signal-to-noise ratio while
amplifying uniformely the entire image.
