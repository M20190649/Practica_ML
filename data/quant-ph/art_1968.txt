The magnetic field generated by an electron bound in angular-momentum
  eigenstates
The magnetic field generated by an electron bound in a spherically symmetric
potential is calculated for eigenstates of the orbital and total angular
momentum. General expressions are presented for the current density in such
states and the magnetic field is calculated through the vector potential, which
is obtained from the current density by direct integration. The method is
applied to the hydrogen atom, for which we reproduce and extend known results.
