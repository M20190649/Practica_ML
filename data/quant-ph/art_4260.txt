Entanglement, identical particles and the uncertainty principle
A new uncertainty relation (UR) is obtained for a system of N identical pure
entangled particles if we use symmetrized observables when deriving the
inequality. This new expression can be written in a form where we identify a
term which explicitly shows the quantum correlations among the particles that
constitute the system. For the particular cases of two and three particles,
making use of the Schwarz inequality, we obtain new lower bounds for the UR
that are different from the standard one.
