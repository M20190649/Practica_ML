Beyond single-photon localization at the edge of a Photonic Band Gap
We study spontaneous emission in an atomic ladder system, with both
transitions coupled near-resonantly to the edge of a photonic band gap
continuum. The problem is solved through a recently developed technique and
leads to the formation of a ``two-photon+atom'' bound state with fractional
population trapping in both upper states. In the long-time limit, the atom can
be found excited in a superposition of the upper states and a ``direct''
two-photon process coexists with the stepwise one. The sensitivity of the
effect to the particular form of the density of states is also explored.
