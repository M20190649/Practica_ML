Functional Approach to Quantum Decoherence and the Classical Final Limit
For a wide set of quantum systems it is demonstrated that the quantum regime
can be considered as the transient phase while the final classical statistical
regime is a permanent state. A basis where exact matrix decoherence appears for
these final states is found. The relation with the decoherence of histories
formalism is studied. A set of final intrinsically consistent histories is
found.
