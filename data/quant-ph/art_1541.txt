Superradiant Laser: First-Order Phase Transition and Non-stationary
  Regime
We solve the superradiant laser model in two limiting cases. First the
stationary low-pumping regime is considered where a first-order phase
transition in the semiclassical solution occurs. This discontinuity is smeared
out in the quantum regime. Second, we solve the model in the non-stationary
regime where we find a temporally periodic solution. For a certain parameter
range well separated pulses may occur.
