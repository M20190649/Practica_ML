Squeezed States for General Multiphoton Systems: Towards the
  displacement-operator formalism
We propose a displacement-operator approach to some aspects of squeezed
states for general multiphoton systems. The explicit displacement-operators of
the squeezed vacuum and the coherent states are achieved and expresses as the
ordinary exponential form. As a byproduct the coherent states of the
$q$-oscillator are obtained by the {\it usual exponential}
displacement-operator.
