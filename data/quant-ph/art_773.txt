Quantum Nondemolition Monitoring of Universal Quantum Computers
The halt scheme for quantum Turing machines, originally proposed by Deutsch,
is reformulated precisely and is proved to work without spoiling the
computation. The ``conflict'' pointed out recently by Myers in the definition
of a universal quantum computer is shown to be only apparent. In the context of
quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement, it is also shown that the output
observable, an observable representing the output of the computation, is a QND
observable and that the halt scheme is equivalent to the QND monitoring of the
output observable.
