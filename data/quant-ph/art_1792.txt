Just Two Nonorthogonal Quantum States
From the perspective of quantum information theory, a system so simple as one
restricted to just two nonorthogonal states can be surprisingly rich in
physics. In this paper, we explore the extent of this statement through a
review of three topics: (1) ``nonlocality without entanglement'' as exhibited
in binary quantum communication channels, (2) the tradeoff between information
gain and state disturbance for two prescribed states, and (3) the quantitative
clonability of those states. Each topic in its own way quantifies the extent to
which two states are ``quantum'' with respect to each other, i.e., the extent
to which the two together violate some classical precept. It is suggested that
even toy examples such as these hold some promise for shedding light on the
foundations of quantum theory.
