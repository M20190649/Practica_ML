Bell inequalities for arbitrarily high dimensional systems
We develop a novel approach to Bell inequalities based on a constraint that
the correlations exhibited by local realistic theories must satisfy. This is
used to construct a family of Bell inequalities for bipartite quantum systems
of arbitrarily high dimensionality which are strongly resistant to noise. In
particular our work gives an analytic description of numerical results of D.
