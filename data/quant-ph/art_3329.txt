Sampling the canonical phase from phase-space functions
We discuss the possibility of sampling exponential moments of the canonical
phase from the s-parametrized phase space functions. We show that the sampling
kernels exist and are well-behaved for any s>-1, whereas for s=-1 the kernels
diverge in the origin. In spite of that we show that the phase space moments
can be sampled with any predefined accuracy from the Q-function measured in the
double-homodyne scheme with perfect detectors. We discuss the effect of
imperfect detection and address sampling schemes using other measurable
phase-space functions. Finally, we discuss the problem of sampling the
canonical phase distribution itself.
