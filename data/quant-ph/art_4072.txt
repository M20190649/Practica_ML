Performance of Photon-Pair Quantum Key Distribution Systems
We analyze the quantitative improvement in performance provided by a novel
quantum key distribution (QKD) system that employs a correlated photon source
(CPS) and a photon-number resolving detector (PNR). Our calculations suggest
that given current technology, the CPR implementation offers an improvement of
several orders of magnitude in secure bit rate over previously described
implementations.
