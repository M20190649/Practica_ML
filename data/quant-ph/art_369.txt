How much does it cost to teleport?
We show that the entropy of entanglement of a state characterizes its ability
to teleport. In particular, in order to teleport faithfully an unknown quantum
$N$-state, the two users must share an entangled state with at least $\log_2 N$
bits entropy of entanglement. We also note that the maximum capacity for a
mixed state ${\cal M}$ to teleport equals the maximum amount of entanglement
entropy that can be distilled out from ${\cal M}$. Our result, therefore,
provides an alternative interpretation for entanglement purification.
