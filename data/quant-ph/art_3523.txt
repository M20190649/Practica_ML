Experimental observation of nonclassical effects on single-photon
  detection rates
It is often asserted that quantum effects can be observed in coincidence
detection rates or other correlations, but never in the rate of single-photon
detection. We observe nonclassical interference in a singles rate, thanks to
the intrinsic nonlinearity of photon counters. This is due to a dependence of
the effective detection efficiency on the quantum statistics of the light beam.
Such measurements of detector response to photon pairs promise to shed light on
the microscopic aspects of silicon photodetectors, and on general issues of
quantum measurement and decoherence.
