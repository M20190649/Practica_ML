Dynamic disquantization of Dirac equation
Classical model S_dc of Dirac particle S_D is constructed. S_D is the dynamic
system described by the Dirac equation. Its classical analog S_dc is described
by a system of ordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant
h as a parameter. Dynamic equations for S_dc are determined by the Dirac
equation uniquely. Both dynamic systems S_D and S_dc appear to be
nonrelativistic. One succeeded in transforming nonrelativistic dynamic system
S_dc into relativistic one S_dcr. The dynamic system S_dcr appears to be a
two-particle structure (special case of a relativistic rotator). It explains
freely such properties of S_D as spin and magnetic moment, which are strange
for pointlike structure. The rigidity function f_r(a), describing rotational
part of total mass as a function of the radius $a$ of rotator, has been
calculated for S_dcr. For investigation of S_D and construction of S_dc one
uses new dynamic methods: dynamic quantization and dynamic disquantization.
These relativistic pure dynamic procedures do not use principles of quantum
mechanics (QM). They generalize and replace conventional quantization and
transition to classical approximation. Totality of these methods forms the
model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP). Technique of MCQP is more subtle
and effective, than conventional methods of QM. MCQP relates to conventional
QM, much as the statistical physics relates to thermodynamics.
