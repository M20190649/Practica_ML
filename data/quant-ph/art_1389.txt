Field Oscillations in a Micromaser with Injected Atomic Coherence
The electric field in a lossless, regularly-pumped micromaser with injected
atomic coherence can undergo a period 2 oscillations in the steady state. The
field changes its value after a single atom passes through the micromaser
cavity, but returns to its original value after a second atom travels through.
We give a simple explanation for this phenomenon in terms of tangent and
cotangent states. We also examine the effect of cavity damping on this steady
state.
