Reconstruction of the joint state of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate
We propose a scheme to reconstruct the state of a two-mode Bose-Einstein
condensate, with a given total number of atoms, using an atom interferometer
that requires beam splitter, phase shift and non-ideal atom counting
operations. The density matrix in the number-state basis can be computed
directly from the probabilities of different counts for various phase shifts
between the original modes, unless the beamsplitter is exactly balanced.
Simulated noisy data from a two-mode coherent state is produced and the state
is reconstructed, for 49 atoms. The error can be estimated from the singular
values of the transformation matrix between state and probability data.
