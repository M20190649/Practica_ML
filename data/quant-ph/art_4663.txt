Quantum algorithm for finding periodicities in the spectrum of a
  black-box Hamiltonian or unitary transformation
Estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary transformation U by standard phase
estimation requires the implementation of controlled-U-gates which are not
available if U is only given as a black box.
  We show that a simple trick allows to measure eigenvalues of U\otimes
U^\dagger even in this case. Running the algorithm several times allows
therefore to estimate the autocorrelation function of the density of
eigenstates of U. This can be applied to find periodicities in the energy
spectrum of a quantum system with unknown Hamiltonian if it can be coupled to a
quantum computer.
