Quantization via hopping amplitudes: Schroedinger equation and free QED
Schroedinger's equation with scalar and vector potentials is shown to
describe "nothing but" hopping of a quantum particle on a lattice; any spatial
variation of the hopping amplitudes acts like an external electric and/or
magnetic field. The main point of the argument is the superposition principle
for state vectors; Lagrangians, path integrals, or classical Hamiltonians are
not (!) required. Analogously, the Hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic
field is obtained as a twofold continuum limit of unitary hopping in Z(N) link
configuration space, if gauge invariance and C and P symmetries are imposed.
