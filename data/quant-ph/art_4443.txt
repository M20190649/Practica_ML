A Method for Justification of the View of Observables in Quantum
  Mechanics and Probability Distributions in Phase Space
There are considered some corollaries of certain hypotheses on the
observation process of microphenomena. We show that an enlargement of the phase
space and of its motion group and an account for the diffusion motions of
microsystems in the enlarged space, the motions which act by small random
translations along the enlarged group, lead to observable quantum effects. This
approach enables one to recover probability distributions in the phase space
for wave functions. The parameters of the model considered here are estimated
on the base of Lamb's shift in the spectrum of the hydrogen's atom.
