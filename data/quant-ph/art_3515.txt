Quantum disentanglers
It is not possible to disentangle a qubit in an unknown state $|\psi>$ from a
set of (N-1) ancilla qubits prepared in a specific reference state $|0>$. That
is, it is not possible to {\em perfectly} perform the transformation
$(|\psi,0...,0\r +|0,\psi,...,0\r +...+ |0,0,...\psi\r) \to |0,...,0>\otimes
|\psi>$. The question is then how well we can do? We consider a number of
different methods of extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed
from that qubit and a set of ancilla qubits in an known state. Measuring the
whole system is, as expected, the least effective method. We present various
quantum ``devices'' which disentangle the unknown qubit from the set of ancilla
qubits. In particular, we present the optimal universal disentangler which
disentangles the unknown qubit with the fidelity which does not depend on the
state of the qubit, and a probabilistic disentangler which performs the perfect
disentangling transformation, but with a probability less than one.
