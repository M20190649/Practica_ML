Timelike Nonseparability and Retrocausation
Renewed interest in the quantum zigzagging causality model is highlighted by
an ingenious proposal by Suarez (quant-ph/9801061) to test the timelike aspect
of nonseparability. Taking advantage of a work by Froehner I argue that the
Dirac representation of a state, has the Bayesian-like connotation of best
estimate given the Hilbert frame chosen. As a measurement perturbs
uncontrollably a system it is (Hoekzema's wording) a retroparation. My bet is
that Suarez' sources and sinks of paired particles operating inside the
coherence length of the laser beam will evidence retrocausation.
