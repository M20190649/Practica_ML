Hyperentangled States
We investigate a new class of entangled states, which we call
'hyperentangled',that have EPR correlations identical to those in the vacuum
state of a relativistic quantum field. We show that whenever hyperentangled
states exist in any quantum theory, they are dense in its state space. We also
give prescriptions for constructing hyperentangled states that involve an
arbitrarily large collection of systems.
