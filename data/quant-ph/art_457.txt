Dynamical identification of open quantum systems
I propose a quantum trajectories approach to parametric identification of the
effective Hamiltonian for a Markovian open quantum system, and discuss an
application motivated by recent experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics.
This example illustrates a strategy for quantum parameter estimation that
efficiently utilizes the information carried by correlations between
measurements distributed in time.
