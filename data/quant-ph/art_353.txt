Action and Passion at a Distance: An Essay in Honor of Professor Abner
  Shimony
Quantum mechanics permits nonlocality---both nonlocal correlations and
nonlocal equations of motion---while respecting relativistic causality. Is
quantum mechanics the unique theory that reconciles nonlocality and causality?
We consider two models, going beyond quantum mechanics, of
nonlocality---``superquantum" correlations, and nonlocal ``jamming" of
correlations---and derive new results for the jamming model. In one space
dimension, jamming allows reversal of the sequence of cause and effect; in
higher dimensions, however, effect never precedes cause.
