Quantum interference in optical fields and atomic radiation
We discuss the connection between quantum interference effects in optical
beams and radiation fields emitted from atomic systems. We illustrate this
connection by a study of the first- and second-order correlation functions of
optical fields and atomic dipole moments. We explore the role of correlations
between the emitting systems and present examples of practical methods to
implement two systems with non-orthogonal dipole moments. We also derive
general conditions for quantum interference in a two-atom system and for a
control of spontaneous emission. The relation between population trapping and
dark states is also discussed. Moreover, we present quantum dressed-atom models
of cancellation of spontaneous emission, amplification on dark transitions,
fluorescence quenching and coherent population trapping.
