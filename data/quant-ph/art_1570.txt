Exploiting Particle Statistics in Quantum Computation
We describe a plausible-speculative form of quantum computation which
exploits particle (fermionic, bosonic) statistics, under a generalized,
counterfactual interpretation thereof. In the idealized situation of an
isolated system, it seems that this form of computation yields to
NP-complete=P.
