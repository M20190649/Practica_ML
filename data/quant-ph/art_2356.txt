Empirical State Determination of Entangled Two-Level Systems and its
  Relation to Information Theory
Theoretical methods for empirical state determination of entangled two-level
systems are analyzed in relation to information theory. We show that hidden
variable theories would lead to a Shannon index of correlation between the
entangled subsystems which is larger that that predicted by quantum mechanics.
Canonical representations which have maximal correlations are treated by the
use of Schmidt decomposition of the entangled states, including especially the
Bohm singlet state and the GHZ entangled states. We show that quantum mechanics
does not violate locality, but does violate realism.
