Axiomatic foundations of quantum mechanics revisited: the case for
  systems
We present an axiomatization of non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics for a
system with an arbitrary number of components. The interpretation of our system
of axioms is realistic and objective. The EPR paradox and its relation with
realism is discussed in this framework. It is shown that there is no
contradiction between realism and recent experimental results.
