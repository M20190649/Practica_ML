Polarization coherent states and geometric phases in quantum optics
Polarization coherent states (PCS) are considered as generalized coherent
states of $SU(2)_p$ group of the polarization invariance of the light fields.
The geometric phases of PCS are introduced in a way, analogous to that used in
the classical polarization optics.
