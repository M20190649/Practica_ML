Determination of entangled quantum states of a trapped atom
We propose a method for measuring entangled vibronic quantum states of a
trapped atom. It is based on the nonlinear dynamics of the system that appears
by resonantly driving a weak electronic transition. The proposed technique
allows the direct sampling of a Wigner-function matrix, displaying all knowable
information on the quantum correlations of the motional and electronic degrees
of freedom of the atom. It opens novel possibilities for testing fundamental
predictions of the quantum theory concerning interaction phenomena.
