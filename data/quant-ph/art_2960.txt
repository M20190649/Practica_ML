Catalysis of entanglement manipulation for mixed states
We consider entanglement-assisted remote quantum state manipulation of
bi-partite mixed states. Several aspects are addressed: we present a class of
mixed states of rank two that can be transformed into another class of mixed
states under entanglement-assisted local operations with classical
communication, but for which such a transformation is impossible without
assistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate enhancement of the efficiency of
purification protocols with the help of entanglement-assisted operations.
Finally, transformations from one mixed state to mixed target states which are
sufficiently close to the source state are contrasted to similar
transformations in the pure-state case.
