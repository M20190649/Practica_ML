The query complexity of order-finding
We consider the problem where P is an unknown permutation on {0,1,...,2^n -
1}, y is an element of {0,1,...,2^n - 1}, and the goal is to determine the
minimum r > 0 such that P^r(y) = y (where P^r is P composed with itself r
times). Information about P is available only via queries that yield P^x(y)
from any x in {0,1,...,2^m - 1} and y in {0,1,...,2^n - 1} (where m is
polynomial in n). The main resource under consideration is the number of these
queries. We show that the number of queries necessary to solve the problem in
the classical probabilistic bounded-error model is exponential in n. This
contrasts sharply with the quantum bounded-error model, where a constant number
of queries suffices.
