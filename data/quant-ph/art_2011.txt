Quantization via Classical Orbits
A systematic method for calculating higher-order corrections of the
relativistic semiclassical fixed-energy amplitude is given. The central scheme
in computing corrections of all orders is related to a time ordering operation
of an operator involving the Van Vleck determinant. This study provides us a
new viewpoint for quantization.
