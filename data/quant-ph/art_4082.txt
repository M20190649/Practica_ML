Entanglement Induced Phase Transitions
Starting from the canonical ensemble over the space of pure quantum states,
we obtain an integral representation for the partition function. This is used
to calculate the magnetisation of a system of N spin-1/2 particles. The results
suggest the existence of a new type of first order phase transition that occurs
at zero temperature in the absence of spin-spin interactions. The transition
arises as a consequence of quantum entanglement. The effects of internal
interactions are analysed and the behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility for
a small number of interacting spins is determined.
