Efficient Algorithm for Optimal Control of Mixed-State Quantum Systems
In [1] Zhu and Rabitz presented a rapidly convergent iterative algorithm for
optimal control of the expectation value of a positive definite observable in a
pure-state quantum system. In this paper we generalize this algorithm to a
quantum statistical mechanics setting and show that it is both efficient in the
mixed-state case and effective in achieving the control objective of maximizing
the ensemble average of arbitrary observables in the cases studied.
