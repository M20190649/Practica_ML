Nonlinear Optics and Quantum Entanglement of Ultra-Slow Single Photons
Two light pulses propagating with ultra-slow group velocities in a coherently
prepared atomic gas exhibit dissipation-free nonlinear coupling of an
unprecedented strength. This enables a single-photon pulse to coherently
control or manipulate the quantum state of the other. Processes of this kind
result in generation of entangled states of radiation field and open up new
prospectives for quantum information processing.
