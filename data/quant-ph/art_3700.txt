Universal Manipulation of a Single Qubit
We find the optimal universal way of manipulating a single qubit,
|psi(theta,phi)>, such that (theta,phi)->(theta-k,phi-l). Such optimal
transformations fall into two classes. For 0 =< k =< pi/2 the optimal map is
the identity and the fidelity varies monotonically from 1 (for k=0) to 1/2 (for
k=pi/2). For pi/2 =< k =< pi the optimal map is the universal-NOT gate and the
fidelity varies monotonically from 1/2 (for k=pi/2) to 2/3 (for k=pi). The
fidelity 2/3 is equal to the fidelity of measurement. It is therefore rather
surprising that for some values of k the fidelity is lower than 2/3.
