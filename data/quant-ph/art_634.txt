Quantum State Diffusion: from Foundations to Applications
Deeper insight leads to better practice. We show how the study of the
foundations of quantum mechanics has led to new pictures of open systems and to
a method of computation which is practical and can be used where others cannot.
We illustrate the power of the new method by a series of pictures that show the
emergence of classical features in a quantum world. We compare the development
of quantum mechanics and of the theory of (biological) evolution.
