Quantization of Non-Hamiltonian Systems
In this paper a generalization of Weyl quantization which maps a dynamical
operator in a function space to a dynamical superoperator in an operator space
is suggested. Quantization of dynamical operator, which cannot be represented
as Poisson bracket with some function, is considered. The usual Weyl
quantization of observables can be derived as a specific case of suggested
quantization if dynamical operator is an operator of multiplication on a
function. This approach allows to define consistent Weyl quantization of
non-Hamiltonian and dissipative systems. Examples of the harmonic oscillator
with friction and a system which evolves by Fokker-Planck-type equation are
considered.
