Quantum clock synchronization and quantum error correction
I consider quantum protocols for clock synchronization, and investigate in
particular whether entanglement distillation or quantum error-correcting codes
can improve the robustness of these protocols. I also draw attention to some
unanswered questions about the relativistic theory of quantum measurement. This
paper is based on a talk given at the NASA-DoD Workshop on Quantum Information
and Clock Synchronization for Space Applications (QuICSSA), September 25-26,
2000.
