Reply on the ``Comment on `Loss-error compensation in quantum- state
  measurements' ''
The authors of the Comment [G. M. D'Ariano and C. Macchiavello to be
published in Phys. Rev. A, quant-ph/9701009] tried to reestablish a 0.5
efficiency bound for loss compensation in optical homodyne tomography. In our
reply we demonstrate that neither does such a rigorous bound exist nor is the
bound required for ruling out the state reconstruction of an individual system
