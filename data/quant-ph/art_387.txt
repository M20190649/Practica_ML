Unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is impossible
The claim of quantum cryptography has always been that it can provide
protocols that are unconditionally secure, that is, for which the security does
not depend on any restriction on the time, space or technology available to the
cheaters. We show that this claim does not hold for any quantum bit commitment
protocol. Since many cryptographic tasks use bit commitment as a basic
primitive, this result implies a severe setback for quantum cryptography. The
model used encompasses all reasonable implementations of quantum bit commitment
protocols in which the participants have not met before, including those that
make use of the theory of special relativity.
