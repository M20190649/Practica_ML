Optimal Universal and State-Dependent Quantum Cloning
We establish the best possible approximation to a perfect quantum cloning
machine which produces two clones out of a single input. We analyze both
universal and state-dependent cloners. The maximal fidelity of cloning is shown
to be 5/6 for universal cloners. It can be achieved either by a special unitary
evolution or by a novel teleportation scheme. We construct the optimal
state-dependent cloners operating on any prescribed two non-orthogonal states,
discuss their fidelities and the use of auxiliary physical resources in the
process of cloning. The optimal universal cloners permit us to derive a new
upper bound on the quantum capacity of the depolarizing quantum channel.
