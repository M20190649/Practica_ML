Time dependent nonclassical properties of even and odd nonlinear
  coherent states
We construct even and odd nonlinear coherent states of a parametric
oscillator and examine their nonclassical properties.It has been shown that
these superpositions exhibit squeezing and photon antibunching which change
with time.
