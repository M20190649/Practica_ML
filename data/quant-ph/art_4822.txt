Quantum coherence generated by interference-induced state selectiveness
The relations between quantum coherence and quantum interference are
discussed. A general method for generation of quantum coherence through
interference-induced state selection is introduced and then applied to `simple'
atomic systems under two-photon transitions, with applications in quantum
optics and laser cooling.
