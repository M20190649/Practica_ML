Quantum entanglement and classical separability in NMR computing
In the discussion about the quantumness of NMR computation a conclusion is
done that computational states are separable and therefore can not be
entangled. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the initial density
matrix of an individual molecule coincides with whole sample molecules
distribution over single molecule energy levels. This means that quantum
stochasticity is replaced by classical stochasticity. In the present paper it
is shown, that quantum NMR computation can create genuine entangled states if
initial system states are thermodynamical equilibrium ones. A separability
analysis problem can arise when one interprets the readout signal from whole
sample.
