Entanglement Concentration of Individual Photon Pairs via Linear Optical
  Logic
We propose a scheme for concentrating nonmaximally pure and mixed
polarization-entangled state of individual photon pairs. The scheme uses only
simple linear optical elements and may be feasible within current optical
technology.
