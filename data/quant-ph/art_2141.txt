A Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser
This paper reports a "delayed choice quantum eraser" experiment proposed by
Scully and Dr\"{u}hl in 1982. The experimental results demonstrated the
possibility of simultaneously observing both particle-like and wave-like
behavior of a quantum via quantum entanglement. The which-path or both-path
information of a quantum can be erased or marked by its entangled twin even
after the registration of the quantum.
