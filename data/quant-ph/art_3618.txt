A reply to "Quantum Clock Synchronization"
Recently a protocol for Quantum Clock Synchronization (QCS) of remote clocks
using quantum entanglement was proposed by Jozsa et al. This method has the
goal of eliminating the random noise present in classical synchronization
techniques. However, as stated QCS depends on the two members of each entangled
pair undergoing the same unitary evolution even while being transported to
different locations. This is essentially equivalent to a perfect Eddington Slow
Clock Transfer protocol and thus, not an improvement over classical techniques.
We will discuss this and suggest ways in which QCS may still be used.
