Coherent Atom Interactions Mediated by Dark-State Polaritons
We suggest a technique to induce effective, controllable interactions between
atoms that is based on Raman scattering into an optical mode propagating with a
slow group velocity. The resulting excitation corresponds to the creation of
spin-flipped atomic pairs in a way that is analogous to correlated photon
emission in optical parametric amplification. The technique can be used for
fast generation of entangled atomic ensembles, spin squeezing and applications
in quantum information processing.
