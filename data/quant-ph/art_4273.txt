Quantum Switch for Continuous Variable Teleportation
A novel quantum switch for continuous variables teleportation is proposed.
Two pairs of EPR beams with identical frequency and constant phase relation are
composed on two beamsplitters to produce two pairs of conditional entangled
beams, two of which are sent to two sending stations(Alices) and others to two
receiving stations(bobs). The EPR entanglement initionally results from
two-mode quadrature squeezed state light. Converting the squeezed component of
one of EPR sources between amplitude and phase, the input quantum state at a
sender will be reproduced at two receivers in turn. The switching system
manipulated by squeezed state light might be developed as a practical quantum
switch device for the communication and teleportation of quantum information.
