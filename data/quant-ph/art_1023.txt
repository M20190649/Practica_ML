Comment on ``Experimental demonstration of the violation of local
  realism without Bell inequalities'' by Torgerson et al
We exhibit a local-hidden-variable model in agreement with the results of the
two-photon coincidence experiment made by Torgerson et al. [Phys. Lett. A 204
(1995) 323]. The existence of any such model shows that the experiment does not
exclude local realism.
