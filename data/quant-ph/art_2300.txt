Transmission time of wave packets through tunneling barriers
The transmission of wave packets through tunneling barriers is studied in
detail by the method of quantum molecular dynamics. The distribution function
of the times describing the arrival of a tunneling packet in front of and
behind a barrier and the momentum distribution function of the packet are
calculated. The behavior of the average coordinate of a packet, the average
momentum, and their variances is investigated. It is found that under the
barrier a part of the packet is reflected and a Gaussian barrier increases the
average momentum of the transmitted packet and its variance in momentum space.
