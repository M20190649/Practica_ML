The exact solution for the superfluorescence of low density Frenkel
  excitons in double and triple lattice-layers
In low density regime, the fluorescence of Frenkel exitons in crystal slab
can be studied without the aid of rotating wave and Mackoffian approximation.
The equations for the case of double and triple lattice-layers are now solved
exactly to give the eigen decay rates, frequency shifts and the statistical
properties of the fields.
