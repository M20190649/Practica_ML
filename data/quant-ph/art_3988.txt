Quantum-State Engineering of Multiple Trapped Ions for Center-of-Mass
  Mode
We propose a scheme to generate a superposition with arbitrary coefficients
on a line in phase space for the center-of-mass vibrational mode of N ions by
means of isolating all other spectator vibrational modes from the
center-of-mass mode. It can be viewed as the generation of previous methods for
preparing motional states of one ion. For large number of ions, we need only
one cyclic operatin to generate such a superposition of many coherent states.
