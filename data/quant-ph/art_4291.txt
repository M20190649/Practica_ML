Quantum dense coding using three qubits
We consider a situation in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share a 3-qubit
system coupled in an initial maximally entangled, GHZ state. By manipulating
locally two of the qubits, Alice can prepare any one of the eight 3-qubit GHZ
states. Thus the sending of Alice's two qubits to Bob, entails 3 bits of
classical information which can be recovered by Bob by means of a measurement
distinguishing the eight (orthonormal) GHZ states. This contrasts with the
2-qubit case, in which Alice can prepare any of the four Bell states by acting
locally only on one of the qubits.
