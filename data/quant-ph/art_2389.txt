Calculation of the Deflection of Light Ray near the Sun with
  Quantum-corrected Newton's Gravitation Law
The deflection of light ray passing near the Sun is calculated with
quantum-corrected Newton's gravitation law. The satisfactory result suggests
that there may exist other theoretical possibilities besides the theory of
relativity.
