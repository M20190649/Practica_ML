Recovery of entanglement lost in entanglement manipulation
When an entangled state is transformed into another one with probability one
by local operations and classical communication, the quantity of entanglement
decreases. This letter shows that entanglement lost in the manipulation can be
partially recovered by an auxiliary entangled pair. As an application, a
maximally entangled pair can be obtained from two partially entangled pairs
with probability one. Finally, this recovery scheme reveals a fundamental
property of entanglement relevant to the existence of incomparable states.
