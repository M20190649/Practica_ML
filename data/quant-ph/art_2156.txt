Zeta function method and repulsive Casimir forces for an unusual pair of
  plates at finite temperature
We apply the generalized zeta function method to compute the Casimir energy
and pressure between an unusual pair of parallel plates at finite temperature,
namely: a perfectly conducting plate and an infinitely permeable one. The high
and low temperature limits of these quantities are discussed; relationships
between high and low temperature limits are estabkished by means of a modified
version of the temperature inversion symmetry.
