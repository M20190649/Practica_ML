Can `unsharp objectification' solve the quantum measurement problem?
The quantum measurement problem is formulated in the form of an insolubility
theorem that states the impossibility of obtaining, for all available object
preparations, a mixture of states of the compound object and apparatus system
that would represent definite pointer positions. A proof is given that
comprises arbitrary object observables, whether sharp or unsharp, and besides
sharp pointer observables a certain class of unsharp pointers, namely, those
allowing for the property of pointer value definiteness. A recent result of H.
Stein is applied to allow for the possibility that a given measurement may not
be applicable to all possible object states but only to a subset of them. The
question is raised whether the statement of the insolubility theorem remains
true for genuinely unsharp observables. This gives rise to a precise notion of
unsharp objectification.
