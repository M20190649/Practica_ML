Pulse-order invariance of the initial-state population in multistate
  chains driven by delayed laser pulses
This paper shows that under certain symmetry conditions the probability of
remaining in the initial state (the probability of no transition) in a
chainwise-connected multistate system driven by two or more delayed laser
pulses does not depend on the pulse order.
