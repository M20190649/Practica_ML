The New Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and Hidden Parameters
The new interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is based on a complex probability
theory. An interpretation postulate specifies events which can be observed and
it follows that the complex probability of such event is, in fact, a real
positive number. The two-slit experiment, the mathematical formulation of the
complex probability theory, the density matrix, Born's law and a possibility of
hidden variables are discussed.
