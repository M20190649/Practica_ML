Clifford algebras, noncommutative tori and universal quantum computers
Recently author suggested [quant-ph/0010071] an application of Clifford
algebras for construction of a "compiler" for universal binary quantum computer
together with later development [quant-ph/0012009] of the similar idea for a
non-binary base. The non-binary case is related with application of some
extension of idea of Clifford algebras. It is noncommutative torus defined by
polynomial algebraic relations of order l. For l=2 it coincides with definition
of Clifford algebra. Here is presented the joint consideration and comparison
of both cases together with some discussion on possible physical consequences.
