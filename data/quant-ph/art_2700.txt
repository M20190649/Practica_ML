Exact solutions of nonstationary Schredinger equations and geometric
  phase
A procedure of solving nonstationary Schredinger equations in the exact
analytic form is elaborated on the basis of exactly solvable stationary models.
The exact solutions are employed to study the nonadiabatic geometric phase.
