Probing the Vacuum Induced Coherence in a $Î›$-system
We propose a simple test to demonstrate and detect the presence of vacuum
inducde coherence in a $\Lambda$-system. We show that the probe field
absorption is modulated due to the presence of such a coherence which is
unobservable in fluorescence. We present analytical and numerical results for
the modulated absorption, the cosine and sine components of which display
different types of behavior.
