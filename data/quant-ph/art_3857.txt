Classical simulation of quantum entanglement without local hidden
  variables
Recent work has extended Bell's theorem by quantifying the amount of
communication required to simulate entangled quantum systems with classical
information. The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from
a set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that
reproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is
measured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a
finite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell
state. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the
communication is merely required to be finite {\em on average}, Bell states can
be simulated {\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show
that arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell
states can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average
(again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the
communication is required to be {\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite
number of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell
state. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic
communication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the
quantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.
