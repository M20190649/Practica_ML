Ultra-Slow Light and Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Effects in a Coherently
  Driven Hot Atomic Gas
We report the observation of small group velocities of order 90 meters per
second, and large group delays of greater than 0.26 ms, in an optically dense
hot rubidium gas (~360 K). Media of this kind yield strong nonlinear
interactions between very weak optical fields, and very sharp spectral
features. The result is in agreement with previous studies on nonlinear
spectroscopy of dense coherent media.
