Quantum slow motion
We simulate the center of mass motion of cold atoms in a standing, amplitude
modulated, laser field as an example of a system that has a classical mixed
phase-space. We show a simple model to explain the momentum distribution of the
atoms taken after any distinct number of modulation cycles. The peaks
corresponding to a classical resonance move towards smaller velocities in
comparison to the velocities of the classical resonances. We explain this by
showing that, for a wave packet on the classical resonances, we can replace the
complicated dynamics in the quantum Liouville equation in phase-space by the
classical dynamics in a modified potential. Therefore we can describe the
quantum mechanical motion of a wave packet on a classical resonance by a purely
classical motion.
