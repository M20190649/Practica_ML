Wigner function and coherence properties of cold and thermal neutrons
We analyze the coherence properties of a cold or a thermal neutron by
utilizing the Wigner quasidistribution function. We look in particular at a
recent experiment performed by Badurek {\em et al.}, in which a polarized
neutron crosses a magnetic field that is orthogonal to its spin, producing
highly non-classical states. The quantal coherence is extremely sensitive to
the field fluctuation at high neutron momenta. A "decoherence parameter" is
introduced in order to get quantitative estimates of the losses of coherence.
