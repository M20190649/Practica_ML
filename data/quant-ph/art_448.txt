Displacement-Operator Squeezed States. II. Examples of Time-Dependent
  Systems Having Isomorphic Symmetry Algebras
In this article, results from the previous paper (I) are applied to
calculations of squeezed states for such well-known systems as the harmonic
oscillator, free particle, linear potential, oscillator with a uniform driving
force, and repulsive oscillator. For each example, expressions for the
expectation values of position and momentum are derived in terms of the initial
position and momentum, as well as in the $(\alpha,z)$- and in the
$(z,\alpha)$-representations described in I. The dependence of the
squeezed-state uncertainty products on the time and on the squeezing parameters
are determined for each system.
