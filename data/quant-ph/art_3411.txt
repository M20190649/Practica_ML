Operations, Disturbance, and Simultaneous Measurability
Quantum mechanics predicts the joint probability distributions of the
outcomes of simultaneous measurements of commuting observables, but the current
formulation lacks the operational definition of simultaneous measurements. In
order to provide foundations of joint statistics of local general measurements
on entangled systems in a general theoretical framework, the question is
answered as to under what condition the outputs of two measuring apparatuses
satisfy the joint probability formula for simultaneous measurements of their
observables. For this purpose, all the possible state changes caused by
measurements of an observable are characterized and the notion of disturbance
in measurement is formalized in terms of operations derived by the measuring
interaction.
