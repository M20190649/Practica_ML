A Kochen-Specker Theorem for Imprecisely Specified Measurement
A recent claim that finite precision in the design of real experiments
``nullifies'' the impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem, is shown to be
unsupportable, because of the continuity of probabilities of measurement
outcomes under slight changes in the experimental configuration.
