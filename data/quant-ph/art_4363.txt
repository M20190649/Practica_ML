Preparation of decoherence-free, subradiant states in a cavity
The cause of decoherence in a quantum system can be traced back to the
interaction with the environment. As it has been pointed out first by Dicke, in
a system of N two-level atoms where each of the atoms is individually dipole
coupled to the environment, there are collective, subradiant states, that have
no dipole coupling to photon modes, and therefore they are expected to decay
slower. This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1
dimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a
scheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a
strongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is
excited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an
appropriately entangled state of the atoms. By applying subsequent laser pulses
at a well defined time instant, it is possible to drive the atomic state into
the subradiant, i. e., decoherence free subspace. Up to a certain average
number of the photons, the result is independent of the state of the cavity.
The analysis of the conditions shows that this scheme is feasible with present
day techniques achieved in atom cavity interaction experiments.
