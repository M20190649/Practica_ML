Anomalous doublets of states in a PT symmetric quantum model
We complexify one of the Natanzon's exactly solvable potentials in PT
symmetric manner and discover that it supports the pairs of bound states with
the same number of nodal zeros. This could indicate that the Sturm Liouville
oscillation theorem does not admit an immediate generalization.
