Classical Teleportation of a Quantum Bit
Classical teleportation is defined as a scenario where the sender is given
the classical description of an arbitrary quantum state while the receiver
simulates any measurement on it. This scenario is shown to be achievable by
transmitting only a few classical bits if the sender and receiver initially
share local hidden variables. Specifically, a communication of 2.19 bits is
sufficient on average for the classical teleportation of a qubit, when
restricted to von Neumann measurements. The generalization to
positive-operator-valued measurements is also discussed.
