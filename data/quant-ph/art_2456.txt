Optical Quantum Random Number Generator
A physical random number generator based on the intrinsic randomness of
quantum mechanics is described. The random events are realized by the choice of
single photons between the two outputs of a beamsplitter. We present a simple
device, which minimizes the impact of the photon counters' noise, dead-time and
after pulses.
