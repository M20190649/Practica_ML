Classical solution of the wave equation
The classical limit of wave quantum mechanics is analyzed. It is shown that
the general requirements of continuity and finiteness to the solution
$\psi(x)=Ae^{i\phi(x)}+ Be^{-i\phi(x)}$, where $\phi(x)=\frac 1\hbar W(x)$ and
$W(x)$ is the reduced classical action of the physical system, result in the
asymptote of the exact solution and general quantization condition for $W(x)$,
which yields the exact eigenvalues of the system.
