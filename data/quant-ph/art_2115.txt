Topology measurement within the histories approach
An idealised experiment estimating the spacetime topology is considered in
both classical and quantum frameworks. The latter is described in terms of
histories approach to quantum theory. A procedure creating combinatorial models
of topology is suggested. The correspondence between these models and
discretised spacetime models is established.
