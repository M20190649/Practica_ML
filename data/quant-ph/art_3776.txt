Atom Chip for Transporting and Merging Magnetically Trapped Atom Clouds
We demonstrate an integrated magnetic ``atom chip'' which transports cold
trapped atoms near a surface with very high positioning accuracy.
Time-dependent currents in a lithographic conductor pattern create a moving
chain of magnetic potential wells; atoms are transported in these wells while
remaining confined in all three dimensions. We achieve fluxes up to 10^6 /s
with a negligible heating rate. An extension of this ``atomic conveyor belt''
allows the merging of magnetically trapped atom clouds by unification of two
Ioffe-Pritchard potentials. Under suitable conditions, the clouds merge without
loss of phase space density. We demonstrate this unification process
experimentally.
