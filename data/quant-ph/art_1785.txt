Improvement of quantum key distribution protocols
The security of the previous quantum key distribution protocols, which is
guaranteed by the nature of physics law, is based on the legitimate users.
However, the impersonation of Alice or Bob by eavesdropper, in practice. will
be existed in a large probability. In this paper an improvement scheme for the
security quantum key is proposed.
