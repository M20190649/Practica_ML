Quantum Boltzmann statistics in interacting systems
Collective operators that describe interaction of generic quantum system with
discrete spectrum with a quantum field are investigated. These operators,
considered as operators in the entangled Fock space (space generated by action
of collective creations on the vacuum) in the stochastic limit satisfy a
particular kind of Quantum Boltzmann (or free) commutational relations. This
clarifies a general phenomenon of arising of Quantum Boltzmann relations in
interacting systems.
