When Worlds Collide: Quantum Probability From Observer Selection?
In Everett's many worlds interpretation, quantum measurements are considered
to be decoherence events. If so, then inexact decoherence may allow large
worlds to mangle the memory of observers in small worlds, creating a cutoff in
observable world size. Smaller world are mangled and so not observed. If this
cutoff is much closer to the median measure size than to the median world size,
the distribution of outcomes seen in unmangled worlds follows the Born rule.
Thus deviations from exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived
via world counting, with a finite number of worlds and no new fundamental
physics.
