Convergence Behavior of Variational Perturbation Expansions
Variational weak-coupling perturbation theory yields converging
approximations, uniformly in the coupling strength. This allows us to calculate
directly the coefficients of `strong-coupling' expansions. For the anharmonic
oscillator we explain the physical origin of the empirically observed
convergence behavior which is exponentially fast with superimposed
oscillations.
