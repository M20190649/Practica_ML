Interference and the lossless lossy beam splitter
By directing the input light into a particular mode it is possible to obtain
as output all of the input light for a beam splitter that is 50% absorbing.
This effect is also responsible for nonlinear quantum interference when two
photons are incident on the beam splitter.
