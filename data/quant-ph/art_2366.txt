Stochastic wave function method for non-Markovian quantum master
  equations
A generalization of the stochastic wave function method to quantum master
equations which are not in Lindblad form is developed. The proposed stochastic
unravelling is based on a description of the reduced system in a doubled
Hilbert space and it is shown, that this method is capable of simulating
quantum master equations with negative transition rates. Non-Markovian effects
in the reduced systems dynamics can be treated within this approach by
employing the time-convolutionless projection operator technique. This ansatz
yields a systematic perturbative expansion of the reduced systems dynamics in
the coupling strength. Several examples such as the damped Jaynes Cummings
model and the spontaneous decay of a two-level system into a photonic band gap
are discussed. The power as well as the limitations of the method are
demonstrated.
