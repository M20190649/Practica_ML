Quantum Information, Irreversibility and State Collapse in Some
  Microscopic Models of Measurement
The quantum measurement problem considered for measuring system (MS) model
which consist of measured state S (particle), detector D and information
processing device O. For spin chains and other O models the state evolution for
MS observables measurements studied. It's shown that specific O states
structure forbids the measurement of MS interference terms which discriminate
pure and mixed S states. It results in the reduction MS Hilbert space to O
representation in which MS evolution is irreversible, which in operational
formalism corresponds to S state collapse. In radiation decoherence O model
Glauber restrictions on QED field observables results in analogous irreversible
MS + field evolution. The results interpretation in Quantum Information
framework and Rovelli Relational Quantum Mechanics discussed.
