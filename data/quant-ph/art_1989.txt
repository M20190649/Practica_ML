Noncomplemetary Wave-Particle Phenomena Revisited
The simultaneous verification of wave and particle property in some recently
suggested experiments has been reviewed in the light of Hilbert space
formalism. In this respect, the recent analysis of biprism experiment [J. L.
Cereceda, Am. J. Phys. 64 (1996) 459] is criticized.
