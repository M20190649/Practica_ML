The assumptions underlying the consistent-amplitude approach to quantum
  theory
In this note I expand further on the main assumptions leading to the
consistent-amplitude approach to quantum theory and I offer a reply to Jerry
Finkelstein's recent comment (quant-ph/9809017) concerning my argument for the
linearity of quantum mechanics (Phys. Rev. A57, 1572 (1998)).
