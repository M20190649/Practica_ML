Interference in dielectrics and pseudo-measurements
Inserting a lossy dielectric into one arm of an interference experiment acts
in many ways like a measurement. If two entangled photons are passed through
the interferometer, a certain amount of information is gained about which path
they took, and the interference pattern in a coincidence count measurement is
suppressed. However, by inserting a second dielectric into the other arm of the
interferometer, one can restore the interference pattern. Two of these
pseudo-measurements can thus cancel each other out. This is somewhat analogous
to the proposed quantum eraser experiments.
