QED derived from the two-body interaction (2) The derivation
We have shown in a previous paper that the Dirac bispinor can vary like a
four-vector and that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) can be reproduced with this
form of behaviour.(2) We have also shown in part I (3) of this paper, that QED
with the same transformational behaviour also holds in a second space which we
called M-space. Here we use M-space to show that QED can be reduced to two
simple rules for a two-body interaction.
