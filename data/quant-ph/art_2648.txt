Solid-State Nuclear Spin Quantum Computer Based on Magnetic Resonance
  Force Microscopy
We propose a nuclear spin quantum computer based on magnetic resonance force
microscopy (MRFM). It is shown that an MRFM single-electron spin measurement
provides three essential requirements for quantum computation in solids: (a)
preparation of the ground state, (b) one- and two- qubit quantum logic gates,
and (c) a measurement of the final state. The proposed quantum computer can
operate at temperatures up to 1K.
