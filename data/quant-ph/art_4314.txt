High order quantum decoherence via multi-particle amplitude for boson
  system
In this paper we depict the high order quantum coherence of a boson system by
using the multi-particle wave amplitude, whose norm square is just the high
order correlation function. This multi-time amplitude can be shown to be a
superposition of several "multi-particle paths". When the environment or a
apparatus entangles with them to form a generalized "which-way" measurement for
many particle system, the quantum decoherence happens in the high order case
dynamically. An explicit illustration is also given with an intracavity system
of two modes interacting with a moving mirror.
