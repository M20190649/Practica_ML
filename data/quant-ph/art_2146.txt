The Schrodinger particle in an oscillating spherical cavity
We study a Schrodinger particle in an infinite spherical well with an
oscillating wall. Parametric resonances emerge when the oscillation frequency
is equal to the energy difference between two eigenstates of the static cavity.
Whereas an analytic calculation based on a two-level system approximation
reproduces the numerical results at low driving amplitudes, epsilon, we observe
a drastic change of behaviour when epsilon > 0.1, when new resonance states
appear bearing no apparent relation to the eigenstates of the static system.
