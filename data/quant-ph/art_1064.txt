Multiparty Quantum Communication Complexity
Quantum entanglement cannot be used to achieve direct communication between
remote parties, but it can reduce the communication needed for some problems.
Let each of k parties hold some partial input data to some fixed k-variable
function f. The communication complexity of f is the minimum number of
classical bits required to be broadcasted for every party to know the value of
f on their inputs.
  We construct a function G such that for the one-round communication model and
three parties, G can be computed with n+1 bits of communication when the
parties share prior entanglement. We then show that without entangled
particles, the one-round communication complexity of G is (3/2)n + 1. Next we
generalize this function to a function F. We show that if the parties share
prior quantum entanglement, then the communication complexity of F is exactly
k. We also show that if no entangled particles are provided, then the
communication complexity of F is roughly k*log(k).
  These two results prove for the first time communication complexity
separations better than a constant number of bits.
