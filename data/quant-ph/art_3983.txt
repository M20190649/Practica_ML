Entangling ions in arrays of microscopic traps
We consider a system of particles in an array of microscopic traps, coupled
to each other via electrostatic interaction, and pushed by an external
state-dependent force. We show how to implement a two-qubit quantum gate
between two such particles with a high fidelity.
