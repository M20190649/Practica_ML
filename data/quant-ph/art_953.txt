Exponential Moments of Canonical Phase: Homodyne Measurements
A method for direct sampling of the exponential moments of canonical phase
from the data recorded in balanced homodyne detection is presented. Analytical
expressions for the sampling functions are shown which are valid for arbitrary
states. A numerical simulation illustrates the applicability of the method and
compares it with the direct measurement of phase by means of double homodyning.
