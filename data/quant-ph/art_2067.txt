Quantum revivals and carpets in some exactly solvable systems
We consider the revival properties of quantum systems with an eigenspectrum
E_{n} proportional to n^{2}, and compare them with the simplest member of this
class - the infinite square well. In addition to having perfect revivals at
integer multiples of the revival time t_{R}, these systems all enjoy perfect
fractional revivals at quarterly intervals of t_{R}. A closer examination of
the quantum evolution is performed for the Poeschel-Teller and Rosen-Morse
potentials, and comparison is made with the infinite square well using quantum
carpets.
