Pasting Quantum Codes
I describe a method for pasting together certain quantum error-correcting
codes that correct one error to make a single larger one-error quantum code. I
show how to construct codes encoding 7 qubits in 13 qubits using the method, as
well as 15 qubits in 21 qubits and all the other "perfect" codes.
