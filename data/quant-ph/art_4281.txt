Observation of transient gain without population inversion in a
  laser-cooled rubidium lambda system
We have observed clear Rabi oscillations of a weak probe in a strongly driven
three-level lambda system in laser-cooled rubidium for the first time. When the
coupling field is non-adiabatically switched on using a Pockels cell, transient
probe gain without population inversion is obtained in the presence of
uncoupled absorptions. Our results are supported by three-state computations.
