Direct particle interaction as the origin of the quantal behaviours
It is argued that the quantal behaviours may be understood in the framework
of direct particle interactions. A specific example is introduced. The assumed
potential predicts that at sufficiently large distances quantal behaviours
arise, while at very large distances gravitational-like forces are present. The
latter is true provided all particles have internal structures.
