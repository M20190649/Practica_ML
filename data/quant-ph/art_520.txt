Superrelativity as a unification of quantum theory and relativity
Principle of ``Superrelativity'' has been proposed in order to avoid the
contradiction between principle of relativity and foundations of quantum
theory. Solutions of a newly derived non-linear Klein-Gordon equation
presumably may be treated as primordial nonlocal elements of quantum theory. It
is shown that in the framework of CP(N-1) model supplementary elements which
are non-local in spacetime but local in the projective Hilbert space permit us
to avoid at least one of the main difficulties of quantum theory-the necessity
to relate the ``reality'' of a quantum state with a measuring process. In the
framework of superrelativity the geometry of the projective Hilbert space
(Fubini-Study metric and connection) together with the non-linear wave equation
are full and closed quantum scheme.
