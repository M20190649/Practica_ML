Classical programmability is enough for quantum circuits universality in
  approximate sense
It was shown by M.A. Nielsen and I.L. Chuang 1997, that it is impossible to
build strictly universal programmable quantum gate array, that could perform
any unitary operation precisely and it was suggested to use probabilistic gate
arrays instead. In present work is shown, that if to use more physical and weak
condition of universality (suggested already in earliest work by D.Deutsch
1985) and to talk about simulation with arbitrary, but finite precision, then
it is possible to build universal programmable gate array. But now the same
no-go theorem by Nielsen and Chuang will have new interesting consequence ---
controlling programs for the gate arrays can be considered as pure classical.
More detailed design of such deterministic quantum gate arrays universal ``in
approximate sense'' is considered in the paper.
