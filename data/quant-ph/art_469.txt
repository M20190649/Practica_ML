Eigenstates of linear combinations of two boson creation and
  annihilation operators : An algebraic approach
Eigenstates of the linear combinations $a^2+\beta a^{\dagger2}$ and $ab+\beta
a^\dagger b^\dagger$ of two boson creation and annihilation operators are
presented. The algebraic procedure given here is based on the work of Shanta et
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 72}, 1447, 1994] for constructing eigenstates of
generalized annihilation operators.
