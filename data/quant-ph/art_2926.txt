Quantum secret sharing using pseudo-GHZ states
We present a setup for quantum secret sharing using pseudo-GHZ states based
on energy-time entanglement. In opposition to true GHZ states, our states do
not enable GHZ-type tests of nonlocality, however, they bare the same quantum
correlations. The relatively high coincidence count rates found in our setup
enable for the first time an application of a quantum communication protocoll
based on more than two qubits.
