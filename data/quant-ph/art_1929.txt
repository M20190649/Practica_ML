Coherence properties of the stochastic oscillator
An oscillator with stochastic frequency is discussed as a model for
evaluating the quantum coherence properties of a physical system. It is found
that the choice of jump statistics has to be considered with care if unphysical
consequences are to be avoided. We investigate one such model, evaluate the
damping it causes, the decoherence rate and the correlations it results in and
the properties of the state for asymptotically long times. Also the choice of
initial state is discussed and its effect on the time evolution of the
correlations.
