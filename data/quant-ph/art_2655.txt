Grover's Algorithm for Multiobject Search in Quantum Computing
L. K. Grover's search algorithm in quantum computing gives an optimal,
square-root speedup in the search for a single object in a large unsorted
database. In this paper, we expound Grover's algorithm in a Hilbert-space
framework that isolates its geometrical essence, and we generalize it to the
case where more than one object satisfies the search criterion.
