Quantum Mechanical Coherence, Resonance, and Mind
Norbert Wiener and J.B.S. Haldane suggested during the early thirties that
the profound changes in our conception of matter entailed by quantum theory
opens the way for our thoughts, and other experiential or mind-like qualities,
to play a role in nature that is causally interactive and effective, rather
than purely epiphenomenal, as required by classical mechanics. The mathematical
basis of this suggestion is described here, and it is then shown how, by giving
mind this efficacious role in natural process, the classical character of our
perceptions of the quantum universe can be seen to be a consequence of
evolutionary pressures for the survival of the species.
