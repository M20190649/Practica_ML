Synthesis and characterization of entangled mesoscopic superpositions
  for a trapped electron
We propose a scheme for the generation and reconstruction of entangled states
between the internal and external (motional) degrees of freedom of a trapped
electron. Such states also exhibit quantum coherence at a mesoscopic level.
