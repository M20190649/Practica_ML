The myth of the photon
We have shown that all "single-photon" and "photon-pair" states, produced in
atomic transitions, and in parametric down conversion by nonlinear optical
crystals, may be represented by positive Wigner densities of the relevant sets
of mode amplitudes. The light fields of all such states are represented as a
real probability ensemble (not a pseudoensemble) of solutions of the
unquantized Maxwell equation.
  The local realist analysis of light-detection events in spatially separated
detectors requires a theory of detection which goes beyond the currently
fashionable single-mode photon theory. It also requires us to recognize that
there is a payoff between detector efficiency and signal-noise discrimination.
Using such a theory, we have demonstrated that all experimental data, both in
atomic cascades and in parametric down conversions, have a consistent local
realist explanation based on the unquantized Maxwell field.
  Finally we discuss current attempts to demonstrate Schroedinger-cat-like
behaviour of microwave cavities interacting with Rydberg atoms. Here also we
demonstrate that there is no experimental evidence which cannot be described by
the unquantized Maxwell field.
  We conclude that misuse of the Photon Concept has resulted in a mistaken
recognition of "nonlocal" phenomena.
