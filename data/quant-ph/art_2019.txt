Invariant Quantum Algorithms for Insertion into an Ordered List
We consider the problem of inserting one item into a list of N-1 ordered
items. We previously showed that no quantum algorithm could solve this problem
in fewer than log N/(2 log log N) queries, for N large. We transform the
problem into a "translationally invariant" problem and restrict attention to
invariant algorithms. We construct the "greedy" invariant algorithm and show
numerically that it outperforms the best classical algorithm for various N. We
also find invariant algorithms that succeed exactly in fewer queries than is
classically possible, and iterating one of them shows that the insertion
problem can be solved in fewer than 0.53 log N quantum queries for large N
(where log N is the classical lower bound). We don't know whether a o(log N)
algorithm exists.
