Transition probability and preferential gauge
This paper is concerned with whether or not the preferential gauge can ensure
the uniqueness and correctness of results obtained from the standard
time-dependent perturbation theory, in which the transition probability is
formulated in terms of matrix elements of Hamiltonian.
