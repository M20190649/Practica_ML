Quantum Computing: Pro and Con
I assess the potential of quantum computation. Broad and important
applications must be found to justify construction of a quantum computer; I
review some of the known quantum algorithms and consider the prospects for
finding new ones. Quantum computers are notoriously susceptible to making
errors; I discuss recently developed fault-tolerant procedures that enable a
quantum computer with noisy gates to perform reliably. Quantum computing
hardware is still in its infancy; I comment on the specifications that should
be met by future hardware. Over the past few years, work on quantum computation
has erected a new classification of computational complexity, has generated
profound insights into the nature of decoherence, and has stimulated the
formulation of new techniques in high-precision experimental physics. A broad
interdisciplinary effort will be needed if quantum computers are to fulfill
their destiny as the world's fastest computing devices. (This paper is an
expanded version of remarks that were prepared for a panel discussion at the
ITP Conference on Quantum Coherence and Decoherence, 17 December 1996.)
