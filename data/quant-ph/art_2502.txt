Von Neumann equations with time-dependent Hamiltonians and
  supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Starting with a time-independent Hamiltonian $h$ and an appropriately chosen
solution of the von Neumann equation $i\dot\rho(t)=[ h,\rho(t)]$ we construct
its binary-Darboux partner $h_1(t)$ and an exact scattering solution of
$i\dot\rho_1(t)=[h_1(t),\rho_1(t)]$ where $h_1(t)$ is time-dependent and not
isospectral to $h$. The method is analogous to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
but is based on a different version of a Darboux transformation. We illustrate
the technique by the example where $h$ corresponds to a 1-D harmonic
oscillator. The resulting $h_1(t)$ represents a scattering of a soliton-like
pulse on a three-level system.
