Statistical Constraints on State Preparation for a Quantum Computer
Quantum computing algorithms require that the quantum register be initially
present in a superposition state. To achieve this, we consider the practical
problem of creating a coherent superposition state of several qubits. Owing to
considerations of quantum statistics, this requires that the entropy of the
system go down. This, in turn, has two practical implications: (i) the initial
state cannot be controlled; (ii) the temperature of the system must be reduced.
These factors, in addition to decoherence and sensitivity to errors, must be
considered in the implementation of quantum computers.
