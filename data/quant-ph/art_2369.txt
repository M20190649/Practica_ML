Non-Hermitian matrix description of the PT symmetric anharmonic
  oscillators
Schroedinger equation H \psi=E \psi with PT - symmetric differential operator
H=H(x) = p^2 + a x^4 + i \beta x^3 +c x^2+i \delta x = H^*(-x) on
L_2(-\infty,\infty) is re-arranged as a linear algebraic diagonalization at
a>0. The proof of this non-variational construction is given. Our Taylor series
form of \psi complements and completes the recent terminating solutions as
obtained for certain couplings \delta at the less common negative a.
