Explicit product ensembles for separable quantum states
We present a general method for constructing pure-product-state
representations for density operators of $N$ quantum bits. If such a
representation has nonnegative expansion coefficients, it provides an explicit
separable ensemble for the density operator. We derive the condition for
separability of a mixture of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with the
maximally mixed state.
