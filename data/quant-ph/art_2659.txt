Peres-Horodecki separability criterion for continuous variable systems
The Peres-Horodecki criterion of positivity under partial transpose is
studied in the context of separability of bipartite continuous variable states.
The partial transpose operation admits, in the continuous case, a geometric
interpretation as mirror reflection in phase space. This recognition leads to
uncertainty principles, stronger than the traditional ones, to be obeyed by all
separable states. For all bipartite Gaussian states, the Peres-Horodecki
criterion turns out to be necessary and sufficient condition for separability.
