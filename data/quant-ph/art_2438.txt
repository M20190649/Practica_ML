Decoherence vs entropy in neutron interferometry
We analyze the coherence properties of polarized neutrons, after they have
interacted with a magnetic field or a phase shifter undergoing different kinds
of statistical fluctuations. We endeavor to probe the degree of disorder of the
distribution of the phase shifts by means of the loss of quantum mechanical
coherence of the neutron. We find that the notion of entropy of the shifts and
that of decoherence of the neutron do not necessarily agree. In some cases the
neutron wave function is more coherent, even though it has interacted with a
more disordered medium.
