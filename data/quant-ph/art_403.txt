Direct sampling of the Susskind-Glogower phase distributions
Coarse-grained phase distributions are introduced that approximate to the
Susskind--Glogower cosine and sine phase distributions. The integral relations
between the phase distributions and the phase-parametrized field-strength
distributions observable in balanced homodyning are derived and the integral
kernels are analyzed. It is shown that the phase distributions can be directly
sampled from the field-strength distributions which offers the possibility of
measuring the Susskind--Glogower cosine and sine phase distributions with
sufficiently well accuracy. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate
the applicability of the method.
