Variational Perturbation Theory for Density Matrices
We develop convergent variational perturbation theory for quantum statistical
density matrices. The theory is applicable to polynomial as well as
nonpolynomial interactions. Illustrating the power of the theory, we calculate
the temperature-dependent density of a particle in a double-well and of the
electron in a hydrogen atom.
