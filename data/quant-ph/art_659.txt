The Plight of `I Am'
This is a short metaphysical fable accentuating the conceptual difficulties
involved, and succinctly criticizing the approaches pursued since the inception
of quantum theory, in dealing with what is known collectively as `the
measurement problem.' It includes some landmark references, and has appeared in
the special issue of Metaphysical Review dedicated to Descartes on his 400th
birthday: Metaphysical Review, vol. 3, no. 1, July 1996.
