Control of dynamical localization by an additional quantum degree of
  freedom
We identify a new parameter that controls the localization length in a driven
quantum system. This parameter results from an additional quantum degree of
freedom. The center-of-mass motion of a two-level ion stored in a Paul trap and
interacting with a standing wave laser field exhibits this phenomenon. We also
discuss the influence of spontaneous emission.
