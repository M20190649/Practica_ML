On intrinsic structure of wave function of fermion triplet in external
  monopole field
Using the Weyl-Tetrode-Fock spinor formalism, the fermion triplet in the 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole field is examined all over again. Spherical solutions
corresponding to the total conserved momentum J =l + S + T are constructed. The
angular dependence is expressed in terms of the Wigner's functions. The radial
system of 12 equations decomposes into two sub-systems by diagonalizing some
complicated inversion operator. The case of minimal j = 1/2 is considered
separately. A more detailed analysis is accomplished for the case of simplest
monopole field: namely, the one produced by putting the Dirac potential into
the non-Abelian scheme. Now a discrete operation diagonalized contains an
additional complex parameter A. The same parameter enters wave functions. This
quantity can manifest itself at matrix elements. In particular, there have been
analyzed the N(A)-parity selection rules: those depending on the A. As shown,
the A-freedom is a consequence of the existence of additional symmetry of the
relevant Hamiltonian. The wave functions exhibit else one kind of freedom:
B-freedom associated in turn with its own symmetry of the Hamiltonian. There
has been examined both A and B-transformations relating functions associated
with different A and B.
