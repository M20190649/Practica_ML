A Quantum Full Adder for a Scalable Nuclear Spin Quantum Computer
We demonstrate a strategy for implementation a quantum full adder in a spin
chain quantum computer. As an example, we simulate a quantum full adder in a
chain containing 201 spins. Our simulations also demonstrate how one can
minimize errors generated by non-resonant effects.
