Practical quantum key distribution over a 48-km optical fiber network
The secure distribution of the secret random bit sequences known as "key"
material, is an essential precursor to their use for the encryption and
decryption of confidential communications. Quantum cryptography is a new
technique for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions:
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither
successfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping
raises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed
experimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of
non-orthogonal photon states to generate shared key material over
multi-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both
cases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per
bit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset
of this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data
reconciliation stage with the sender. Here we report the most recent results of
our optical fiber experiment in which we have performed quantum key
distribution over a 48-km optical fiber network at Los Alamos using photon
interference states with the B92 and BB84 quantum key distribution protocols.
