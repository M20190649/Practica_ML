Generalized Spin-1/2 Operators and Their Eigenvectors
Recently, we have shown how the interpretation of quantum mechanics due to
Lande' can be used to derive from first principles generalized formulas for the
operators and some eigenvectors for spin 1/2 Though we gave the operators for
all the components of the spin, we did not give the eigenvectors of the
operators for the x and y components of the spin. We now give these vectors. In
addition, we present a new and simple method of deriving the operators for the
x and y components of the spin as well as their vectors from those for the z
component. We give a general proof that the operator for the square of the spin
is the unit matrix multiplied by the value of the square of the spin.
