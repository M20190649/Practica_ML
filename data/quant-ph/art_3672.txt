Local Distinguishability of Multipartite Orthogonal Quantum States
We consider one copy of a quantum system prepared in one of two orthogonal
pure states, entangled or otherwise, and distributed between any number of
parties. We demonstrate that it is possible to identify which of these two
states the system is in by means of local operations and classical
communication alone. The protocol we outline is both completely reliable and
completely general - it will correctly distinguish any two orthogonal states
100% of the time.
