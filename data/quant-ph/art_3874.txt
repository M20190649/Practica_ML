Fundamental solution method applied to time evolution of two energy
  level systems: exact and adiabatic limit results
A method of fundamental solutions has been used to investigate transitions in
two energy level systems with no level crossing in a real time. Compact
formulas for transition probabilities have been found in their exact form as
well as in their adiabatic limit. No interference effects resulting from many
level complex crossings as announced by Joye, Mileti and Pfister (Phys. Rev.
{\bf A44} 4280 (1991)) have been detected in either case. It is argued that
these results of this work are incorrect. However, some effects of Berry's
phases are confirmed.
