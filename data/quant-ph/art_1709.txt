Higher-Order Methods for Quantum Simulations
To efficiently implement many-particle quantum simulations on quantum
computers we develop and present methods for inverting the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff lemma to 3rd and 4th order in the commutator. That is,
we reexpress exp{-i(H_1 + H_2 + ...)dt} as a product of factors exp(-i H_1 dt),
exp(-i H_2 dt), ... which is accurate to 3rd or 4th order in dt.
