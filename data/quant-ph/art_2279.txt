PT -symmetric harmonic oscillators
Within the framework of the recently proposed formalism using non-hermitean
Hamiltonians constrained merely by their PT invariance we describe a new
exactly solvable family of the harmonic-oscillator-like potentials with
non-equidistant spectrum. Our one-dimensional superposition of the harmonic x^2
with the centrifugal-like G/x^2 is regularized by a purely imaginary shift of
$x$.
