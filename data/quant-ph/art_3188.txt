Resonant cancellation of off-resonant effects in a multilevel qubit
Off-resonant effects are a significant source of error in quantum
computation. This paper presents a group theoretic proof that off-resonant
transitions to the higher levels of a multilevel qubit can be completely
prevented in principle. This result can be generalized to prevent unwanted
transitions due to qubit-qubit interactions. A simple scheme exploiting dynamic
pulse control techniques is presented that can cancel transitions to higher
states to arbitrary accuracy.
