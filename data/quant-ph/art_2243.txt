Noncausal Superluminal Nonlocal Signalling
We propose a thought experiment for classical superluminal signal
transmission based on the quantum nonlocal influence of photons on their
momentum entangled EPR twins. The signal sender measures either position or
momentum of particles in a pure ensemble of the entangled pairs, leaving their
twins as localized particles or plane waves. The signal receiver distinguishes
these outcomes interferometrically using a double slit interferometer modified
by a system of optical filters. Since the collapse of the wavefunction is
postulated to be instantaneous, this signal can be transmitted superluminally.
We show that the method circumvents the no-signalling theorem because the
receiver is able to modify the disentangled wavefunction before his
measurement. We propose a plan for the possible practical realization of a
superluminal quantum telegraph based on the thought experiment.
