An obstruction based approach to the Kochen-Specker theorem
In [1] it was shown that the Kochen Specker theorem can be written in terms
of the non-existence of global elements of a certain varying set over the
partially ordered set of boolean subalgebras of projection operators on some
Hilbert space. In this paper, we show how obstructions to the construction of
such global elements arise, and how this provides a new way of looking at
proofs of the theorem.
