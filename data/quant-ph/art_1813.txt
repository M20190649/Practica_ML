A small 1-way quantum finite automaton
We study 1-way quantum finite automata (QFAs) and compare them with their
classical counterparts. We show that 1-way QFAs can be very space efficient. We
construct a 1-way QFAs that are quadratically smaller than any equivalent
deterministic finite automata and give the correct answer with a large
probability by recognizing the languages in a two letter alphabet "the number
of the letters a and the number of the letters b are divisible by n".
