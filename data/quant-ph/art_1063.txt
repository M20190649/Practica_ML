The Church-Turing thesis as a guiding principle for physics
Two aspects of the physical side of the Church-Turing thesis are discussed.
The first issue is a variant of the Eleatic argument against motion, dealing
with Zeno squeezed time cycles of computers. The second argument reviews the
issue of one-to-one computation, that is, the bijective (unique and reversible)
evolution of computations and its relation to the measurement process.
