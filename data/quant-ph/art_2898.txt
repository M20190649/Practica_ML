Novel Scheme for Universal Quantum Computation
A scenario for realization of a quantum computer is proposed consisting of
spatially distributed q-bits fabricated in a host structure where nuclear
spin-spin coupling is mediated by laser pulse controlled electron-nuclear
transferred hyperfine (superhyperfine) Fermi contact interaction. Operations
illustrating entanglement, nonlocality, and quantum control logic operations
are presented and discussed. The notion of universality of quantum computation
is introduced and the irreducible conditions are presented. It is demonstrated
that the proposed generic scenario for realization of a quantum computer
fulfills these conditions.
