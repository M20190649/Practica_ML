Bell's Inequalities In 4-dimension Rieman's Space
It is shown that the nature of quantum statistics can study in assumption of
existence of a background of random gravitational fields and waves, distributed
isotropically in the space. This background is capable of correlating phases of
oscillations of identical microobjects. If such a background of random
gravitational fields and waves is considered as hidden variables. It is shown
that the classic physical of Bells observable in the 4-dimensions Rieman's
space gives the value matching the experimental data. The nature of the
entanglement states we are study here.
