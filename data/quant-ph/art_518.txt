Relativistic Quantum Events
We extend the ideas of L.P. Horwitz and C. Piron and we propose a
relativistic version of Event Enhanced Quantum Theory, with an event generating
algorithm for spin one-half particle detectors. The algorithm is based on
proper time formulation of the relativistic quantum theory. Although we use
indefinite metric, all the probabilities controlling the random process of the
detector clicks are non--negative.
