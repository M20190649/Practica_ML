Intense field stabilization in circular polarization: 3D time-dependent
  dynamics
We investigate the stabilization of a hydrogen atom in circularly polarized
laser fields. We use a time-dependent, fully three dimensional approach to
study the quantum dynamics of the hydrogen atom subject to high intensity,
short wavelength laser pulses. We find enhanced survival probability as the
field is increased under fixed envelope conditions. We also confirm wavepacket
dynamics seen in prior time-dependent computations restricted to two
dimensions.
