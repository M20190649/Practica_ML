Realization of Probabilistic Identification and Clone of Quantum-States
  II Multiparticles System
We realize the probabilistic cloning and identifying linear independent
quantum states of multi-particles system, given prior probability, with
universal quantum logic gates using the method of unitary representation. Our
result is universal for separate state and entanglement. We also provide the
realization in the condition given $M$ initial copies for each state.
