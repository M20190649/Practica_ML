Spin Squeezing in the Ising Model
We analyze the collective spin noise in interacting spin systems. General
expressions are derived for the short time behaviour of spin systems with
general spin-spin interactions, and we suggest optimum experimental conditions
for the detection of spin squeezing. For Ising models with site dependent
nearest neighbour interactions general expressions are presented for the spin
squeezing parameter for all times. The reduction of collective spin noise can
be used to verify the entangling powers of quantum computer architectures based
on interacting spins.
