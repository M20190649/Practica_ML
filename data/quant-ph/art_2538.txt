Quantum trajectories for Brownian motion
We present the stochastic Schroedinger equation for the dynamics of a quantum
particle coupled to a high temperature environment and apply it the dynamics of
a driven, damped, nonlinear quantum oscillator. Apart from an initial slip on
the environmental memory time scale, in the mean, our result recovers the
solution of the known non-Lindblad quantum Brownian motion master equation. A
remarkable feature of our approach is its localization property: individual
quantum trajectories remain localized wave packets for all times, even for the
classically chaotic system considered here, the localization being stronger the
smaller $\hbar$.
