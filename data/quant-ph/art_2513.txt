Nonclassical effects in a driven atoms/cavity system in the presence of
  arbitrary driving field and dephasing
We investigate the photon statistics of light transmitted from a driven
optical cavity containing one or two atoms interacting with a single mode of
the cavity field. We treat arbitrary driving fields with emphasis on departure
from previous weak field results. In addition effects of dephasing due to
atomic transit through the cavity mode are included using two different models.
We find that both models show the nonclassical correlations are quite sensitive
to dephasing. The effect of multiple atoms on the system dynamics is
investigated by placing two atoms in the cavity mode at different positions,
therefore having different coupling strengths.
