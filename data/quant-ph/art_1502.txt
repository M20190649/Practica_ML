Time-Symmetrized Quantum Theory, Counterfactuals, and `Advanced Action'
Recent authors have raised objections to the counterfactual interpretation of
the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule of time symmetrized quantum theory
(TSQT). I distinguish between two different readings of the ABL rule,
counterfactual and non-counterfactual, and confirm that TSQT advocate L.
Vaidman is employing the counterfactual reading to which these authors object.
Vaidman has responded to the objections by proposing a new kind of
time-symmetrized counterfactual, which he has defined in two different ways. It
is argued that neither definition succeeds in overcoming the objections, except
in a special case previously noted by Cohen and Hiley. In addition, a
connection is made between TSQT and Price's concept of `advanced action', which
further supports the special case discussed.
