The hyperfine structure of highly charged $^{238}_{92}$U ions with
  rotationally excited nuclei
The hyperfine structure (hfs) of electron levels of $^{238}_{92}$U ions with
the nucleus excited in the low-lying rotational $2^+$ state with an energy
$E_{2^+} = 44.91$ keV is investigated. In hydrogenlike uranium, the hfs
splitting for the $1s_{1/2}$-ground state of the electron constitutes 1.8 eV.
The hyperfine-quenched (hfq) lifetime of the $1s2p ^3P_0$ state has been
calculated for heliumlike $^{238}_{92}$U and was found to be two orders of
magnitude smaller than for the ion with the nucleus in the ground state. The
possibility of a precise determination of the nuclear $g_r$ factor for the
rotational $2^+$ state by measurements of the hfq lifetime is discussed.
