Permutation Symmetry For Many Particles
We consider the implications of the Revised Symmetrization Postulate (see
quant-ph/9908078) for states of more than two particles. We show how to create
permutation symmetric state vectors and how to derive alternative state vectors
that may be asymmetric for any pair by creating asymmetric interdependencies in
their state descriptions. Because we can choose any pair to create such an
asymmetry, the usual generalized exclusion rules which result, apply
simultaneously to any pair. However, we distinguish between simultaneous
pairwise exclusion rules and the simultaneous pairwise anti-symmetry of the
conventional symmetrization postulate. We show how to construct a variety of
state vectors with multiple interdependencies in their state descriptions and
various exchange asymmetries - including one which is anti-symmetric under
exchange of two bosons - all without violating the spin-statistics theorem. We
conjecture that it is possible to construct state vectors for arbitrary mixes
of bosons and fermions that emulate the conventional symmetrization postulate
in a limited way and give examples. We also prove that it is not possible to
define a single state vector that simultaneously obeys the conventional
symmetrization postulate in its standard form (in which the exchange phase does
not depend on the spins of additional particles that are present) for every
pair that can be interchanged.
