Coherent Dark States of Rubidium 87 in a Buffer Gas using Pulsed Laser
  Light
The coherent dark resonance between the hyperfine levels F=1, m=0 and F=2,
m=0 of the rubidium ground state has been observed experimentally with the
light of a pulsed mode-locked diode laser operating at the D1 transition
frequency. The resonance occurs whenever the pulse repetition frequency matches
an integer fraction of the rubidium 87 ground state hyperfine splitting of 6.8
GHz. Spectra have been taken by varying the pulse repetition frequency. Using
cells with argon as a buffer gas a linewidth as narrow as 149 Hz was obtained.
The rubidium ground state decoherence cross section 1.1*10^(-18) cm^2 for
collisions with xenon atoms has been measured for the first time with this
method using a pure isotope rubidium vapor cell and xenon as a buffer gas.
