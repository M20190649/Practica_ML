Measurement of quantum devices
Maximum-likelihood estimation is applied to identification of an unknown
quantum mechanical process represented by a ``black box''. In contrast to
linear reconstruction schemes the proposed approach always yields physically
sensible results. Its feasibility is demonstrated using the Monte Carlo
simulations for the two-level system (single qubit).
