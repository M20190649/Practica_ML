Single-particle Bell-type Inequality
It is generally believed that Bell's inequality holds for the case of
entangled states, including two correlated particles or special states of a
single particle. Here, we derive a single-particle Bell's inequality for two
correlated spin states at two successive times, appealing to the statistical
independence condition in an ideal experiment, for a locally causal hidden
variables theory. We show that regardless of the locality assumption, the
inequality can be violated by some quantum predictions.
