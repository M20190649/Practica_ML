On non-Adiabatic Holonomoic Quantum Computer
Non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase of spin-3/2 system in the rotating
magnetic field is considered. Explicit expression for the corresponding
effective non-Abelian gauge potential is obtained. This formula can be used for
construction of quantum gates in quantum computations.
