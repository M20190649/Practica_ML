Hybrid exciton-polaritons in a bad microcavity containing the organic
  and inorganic quantum wells
We study the hybrid exciton-polaritons in a bad microcavity containing the
organic and inorganic quantum wells. The corresponding polariton states are
given. The analytical solution and the numerical result of the stationary
spectrum for the cavity field are finished
