A two-qubit algorithm involving quantum entanglement
The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is fundamental to the implementation
of quantum computation, and requires at least two qubits for its demonstration.
However, both Deutsch algorithm and Grover's search algorithm for two bits do
not use entanglement. We develop a Deutsch-like problem, where we consider all
possible binary functions for two bit inputs and distinguish their even or odd
nature. The quantum algorithm to solve this problem requires entanglement at
the level of two qubits. The final solution suggests that an NMR implementation
of the problem would lead to interesting results.
