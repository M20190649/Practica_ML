Practical free-space quantum key distribution over 1 km
A working free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) system has been developed
and tested over an outdoor optical path of ~1 km at Los Alamos National
Laboratory under nighttime conditions. Results show that QKD can provide secure
real-time key distribution between parties who have a need to communicate
secretly. Finally, we examine the feasibility of surface to satellite QKD.
