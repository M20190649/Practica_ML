Comparisons of spectra determined using detector atoms and spatial
  correlation functions
We show how two level atoms can be used to determine the local time dependent
spectrum. The method is applied to a one dimensional cavity. The spectrum
obtained is compared with the mode spectrum determined using spatially filtered
second order correlation functions. The spectra obtained using two level atoms
give identical results with the mode spectrum. One benefit of the method is
that only one time averages are needed. It is also more closely related to a
realistic measurement scheme than any other definition of a time dependent
spectrum.
