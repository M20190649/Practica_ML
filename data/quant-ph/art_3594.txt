Scaling Considerations in Ground State Quantum Computation
We study design challenges associated with realizing a ground state quantum
computer. In such a computer, the energy gap between the ground state and first
excited state must be sufficiently large to prevent disruptive excitations.
Here, an estimate is provided of this gap as a function of computer size. We
then address the problem of detecting the output of a ground state quantum
computer. It is shown that the exponential detection difficulties that appear
to be present at first can be overcome in a straightforward manner by small
design changes.
