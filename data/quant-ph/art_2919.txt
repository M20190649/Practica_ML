On stimulated transitions between the self-trapped states of the
  nonlinear Schrodinger equation
The studied model describes a particle that obeys a one-dimensional nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation in the potential of a double-well. Transitions between
the two lowest self-trapped states of this system under the influence of the
external time-dependent perturbation are studied in the two-mode approximation.
If the perturbation dependence on time is harmonic with the frequency $\omega$,
then transitions between the states become possible if the amplitude of the
perturbation $F$ exceeds some threshold value $F_c(\omega)$; above the
threshold motion of the system becomes chaotic. If the perturbation is a
broadband noise, then transitions between the states are possible at
arbitrarily small $F$ and occur in the process of the system's energy
diffusion.
