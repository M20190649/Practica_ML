Bounds on Information and the Security of Quantum Cryptography
Strong attacks against quantum key distribution use quantum memories and
quantum gates to attack directly the final key. In this paper we extend a novel
security result recently obtained, to demonstrate proofs of security against a
wide class of such attacks. To reach this goal we calculate
information-dependent reduced density matrices, we study the geometry of
quantum mixed states, and we find bounds on the information leaked to an
eavesdropper. Our result suggests that quantum cryptography is ultimately
secure.
