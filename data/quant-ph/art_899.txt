Measuring the Cyclotron State of a Trapped Electron
We propose the cyclotron state retrieval of an electron trapped in a Penning
trap by using different measurement schemes based on suitable modifications of
the applied electromagnetic fields and exploiting the axial degree of freedom
as a probe. A test for matter-antimatter symmetry of the quantum state is
proposed.
