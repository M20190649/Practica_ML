Bound-State Problem in a One-Dimensional Cantor-like Potential
One of the best systems for the study of quantum chaos is the atomic nucleus.
A confined particle with general boundary conditions can present chaos and the
eigenvalue problem can exhibit this fact. We study a toy model in which the
potential has a Cantor-like form. The eigenvalue spectrum presents a Devil's
staircase ordering in the semi-classical limit.
