Conditional evolution in single-atom cavity QED
We consider a typical setup of cavity QED consisting of a two-level atom
interacting strongly with a single resonant electromagnetic field mode inside a
cavity. The cavity is resonantly driven and the output undergoes continuous
homodyne measurements. We derive an explicit expression for the state of the
system conditional on a discrete photocount record. This expression takes a
particularly simple form if the system is initially in the steady state. As a
byproduct, we derive a general formula for the steady state that had been
conjectured before in the strong driving limit.
