Entanglement vs. Noncommutativity in Teleportation
We provide an alternative simple proof of the necessity of entanglement in
quantum teleportation by using the no-disentanglement theorem. We show that
this is true even when the state to be teleported is known to be among two
noncommuting qubits. We further show that to teleport any set of commuting
qubits, it is sufficient to have a classically correlated channel. Using this
result we provide a simple proof of the fact that any set of bipartite
entangled states can be exactly disentangled if the single particle density
matrices of any one party commute.
