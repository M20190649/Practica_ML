On the volume of the set of mixed entangled states
A natural measure in the space of density matrices describing N-dimensional
quantum systems is proposed. We study the probability P that a quantum state
chosen randomly with respect to the natural measure is not entangled (is
separable). We find analytical lower and upper bounds for this quantity.
Numerical calculations give P = 0.632 for N=4 and P=0.384 for N=6, and indicate
that P decreases exponentially with N. Analysis of a conditional measure of
separability under the condition of fixed purity shows a clear dualism between
purity and separability: entanglement is typical for pure states, while
separability is connected with quantum mixtures. In particular, states of
sufficiently low purity are necessarily separable.
