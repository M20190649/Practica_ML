Separability of Two-Party Gaussian States
We investigate the separability properties of quantum two-party Gaussian
states in the framework of the operator formalism for the density operator.
Such states arise as natural generalizations of the entangled state originally
introduced by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. We present explicit forms of
separable and nonseparable Gaussian states.
