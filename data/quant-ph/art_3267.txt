Disagreement between correlations of quantum mechanics and stochastic
  electrodynamics in the damped parametric oscillator
Intracavity and external third order correlations in the damped nondegenerate
parametric oscillator are calculated for quantum mechanics and stochastic
electrodynamics (SED), a semiclassical theory. The two theories yield greatly
different results, with the correlations of quantum mechanics being cubic in
the system's nonlinear coupling constant and those of SED being linear in the
same constant. In particular, differences between the two theories are present
in at least a mesoscopic regime. They also exist when realistic damping is
included. Such differences illustrate distinctions between quantum mechanics
and a hidden variable theory for continuous variables.
