Quantum lower bound for sorting
We prove that \Omega(n log(n)) comparisons are necessary for any quantum
algorithm that sorts n numbers with high success probability and uses only
comparisons. If no error is allowed, at least 0.110nlog_2(n) - 0.067n + O(1)
comparisons must be made. The previous known lower bound is \Omega(n).
