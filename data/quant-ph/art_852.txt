Dynamics of Dissipative Two-Level Systems in the Stochastic
  Approximation
The dynamics of the spin-boson Hamiltonian is considered in the stochastic
approximation. The Hamiltonian describes a two-level system coupled to an
environment and is widely used in physics, chemistry and the theory of quantum
measurement. We demonstrate that the method of the stochastic approximation
which is a general method of consideration of dynamics of an arbitrary system
interacting with environment is powerful enough to reproduce qualitatively
striking results by Leggett at al. found earlier for this model. The result
include an exact expression of the dynamics in terms of the spectral density
and show an appearance of two most interesting regimes for the system, i.e.
pure oscillating and pure damping ones. Correlators describing environment are
also computed.
