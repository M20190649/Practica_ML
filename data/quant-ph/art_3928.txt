Bunching and antibunching from single NV color centers in diamond
We investigate correlations between fluorescence photons emitted by single
N-V centers in diamond with respect to the optical excitation power. The
autocorrelation function shows clear photon antibunching at short times,
proving the uniqueness of the emitting center. We also report on a photon
bunching effect, which involves a trapping level. An analysis using
rate-equations for the populations of the N-V center levels shows the intensity
dependence of the rate equation coefficients.
