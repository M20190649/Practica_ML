What information theory can tell us about quantum reality
An investigation of Einstein's ``physical'' reality and the concept of
quantum reality in terms of information theory suggests a solution to quantum
paradoxes such as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and the Schroedinger-cat
paradoxes. Quantum reality, the picture based on unitarily evolving
wavefunctions, is complete, but appears incomplete from the observer's point of
view for fundamental reasons arising from the quantum information theory of
measurement. Physical reality, the picture based on classically accessible
observables is, in the worst case of EPR experiments, unrelated to the quantum
reality it purports to reflect. Thus, quantum information theory implies that
only correlations, not the correlata, are physically accessible: the mantra of
the Ithaca interpretation of quantum mechanics.
