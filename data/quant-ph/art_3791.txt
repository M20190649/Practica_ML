Decoherence within a single atom
An "almost diagonal" reduced density matrix (in coordinate representation) is
usually a result of environment induced decoherence and is considered the sign
of classical behavior. We point out that the proton of a ground state hydrogen
atom can possess such a density matrix. We demonstrate on this example that an
"almost diagonal" reduced density matrix may derive from an interaction with a
low number of degrees of freedom (in our case with a single electron) which
play the role of the environment. We also show that decoherence effects in our
example can only be observed if the interaction with the measuring device is
significantly faster than the interaction with the environment (the electron).
In the opposite case, when the interaction with the environment is significant
during the measurement process, coherence is restored.
  Finally, we propose a neutron scattering experiment on cold He atoms to
observe decoherence which shows up as an additional contribution to the
differential scattering cross section.
