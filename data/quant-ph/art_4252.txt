Orchestrating an NMR quantum computation: the N=3 Deutsch-Jozsa
  algorithm
A detailed description of the development of a three qubit NMR realization of
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [Collins et.al., Phys. Rev. A 62, 022304 (2000)] is
provided. The theoretical and experimental techniques used for the reduction of
the algorithm's evolution steps into a sequence of NMR pulses are discussed at
length. This includes the description of general pulse sequence compilation
techniques, various schemes for indirectly coupled gate realizations,
experimental pulse parameterization techniques and bookkeeping methods for
pulse phases.
