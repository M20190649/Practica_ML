Revival Structure of Stark Wave Packets
The revival structure of Stark wave packets is considered. These wave packets
have energies depending on two quantum numbers and are characterized by two
sets of classical periods and revival times. The additional time scales result
in revival structures different from those of free Rydberg wave packets. We
show that Stark wave packets can exhibit fractional revivals. We also show that
these wave packets exhibit particular features unique to the Stark effect. For
instance, the wave functions can be separated into distinct sums over even and
odd values of the principal quantum number. These even and odd superpositions
interfere in different ways, which results in unexpected periodicities in the
interferograms of Stark wave packets.
