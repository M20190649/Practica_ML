Squeezing enhancement by damping in a driven atom-cavity system
In a driven atom-cavity coupled system in which the two-level atom is driven
by a classical field, the cavity mode which should be in a coherent state in
the absence of its reservoir, can be squeezed by coupling to its reservoir. The
squeezing effect is enhanced as the damping rate of the cavity is increased to
some extent.
