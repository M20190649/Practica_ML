Stochastic Wave-function Simulation of Two-time Correlation Functions
We propose an optimized algorithm for the numerical simulation of two-time
correlation functions by means of stochastic wave functions. As a first
application, we investigate the two-time correlation function of a nonlinear
optical parametric oscillator.
