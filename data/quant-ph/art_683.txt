Tailoring Many-Body Interactions to Solve Hard Combinatorial Problems
A quantum machine consisting of interacting linear clusters of atoms is
proposed for the 3SAT problem. Each cluster with two relevant states of
collective motion can be used to register a Boolean variable. Given any 3SAT
Boolean formula the interactions among the clusters can be so tailored that the
ground state(s) (possibly degenerate) of the whole system encodes the
satisfying truth assignment(s) for it. This relates the 3SAT problem to the
dynamics of the properly designed glass system.
