Oscillating decay of an unstable system
We study the short-time and medium-time behavior of the survival probability
in the frame of the $N$-level Friedrichs model. The time evolution of an
arbitrary unstable initial state is determined. We show that the survival
probability may oscillate significantly during the so-called exponential era.
This result explains qualitatively the experimental observations of the NaI
decay.
