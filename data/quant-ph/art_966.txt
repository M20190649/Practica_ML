On the Convergence of the WKB Series for the Angular Momentum Operator
In this paper we prove a recent conjecture [Robnik M and Salasnich L 1997 J.
Phys. A: Math. Gen. 30 1719] about the convergence of the WKB series for the
angular momentum operator. We demonstrate that the WKB algorithm for the
angular momentum gives the exact quantization formula if all orders are summed.
