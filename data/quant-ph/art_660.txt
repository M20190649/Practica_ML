Proposal for an experiment to measure the Hausdorff dimension of quantum
  mechanical trajectories
We make a proposal for a Gedanken experiment, based on the Aharonov-Bohm
effect, how to measure in principle the zig-zagness of the trajectory of
propagation (abberation from its classical trajectory) of a massive particle in
quantum mechanics. Experiment I is conceived to show that contributions from
quantum paths abberating from the classical trajectory are directly observable.
Experiment II is conceived to measure average length, scaling behavior and
critical exponent (Hausdorff dimension) of quantum mechanical paths.
