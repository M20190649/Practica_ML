Frequency Switching of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator with Time-Dependent
  Frequency
An explicit solution of the equation for the classical harmonic oscillator
with smooth switching of the frequency has been found . A detailed analysis of
a quantum harmonic oscillator with such frequency has been done on the base of
the method of linear invariants. It has been shown that such oscillator
possesses cofluctuant states, different from widely studied Glauber's coherent
and "ideal" squeezed states.
