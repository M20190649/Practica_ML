Hyperfinite-operational Approach to the Problem of Time Reversibility of
  Quantum Mechanics
This paper outlines a mathematical framework of quantum probability in which
the time asymmetry in describing measuring processes is avoided. The main
objects of the framework are hyperfinite operations, which are constructed by
using nonstandard analysis and the operational approach by Davies and Lewis.
Then the notions of Bayesian conditional probability are defined, and
Bayes-type theorems in terms of the probability are showed.
