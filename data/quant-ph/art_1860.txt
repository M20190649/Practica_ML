Schroedinger equation as the universal continuum limit of
  nonrelativistic coherent hopping on a cubic spatial lattice
The Schroedinger equation with scalar and vector potentials is the continuum
limit of any coherent hopping process (where position eigenstates superpose
with neighbouring eigenstates after a time step) whose hopping amplitudes are
homogeneous in quadratic order of the inverse lattice spacing, inhomogeneous in
first order, and satisfying a summability condition with respect to
higher-than-next neighbours.
