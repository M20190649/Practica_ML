Some conceptual issues involving probability in quantum mechanics
We discuss some issues about probability in quantum mechanics, with
particular emphasis on the GHZ theorem. We propose the usage of nonmonotonic
upper probabilities as a tool to derive consistent joint upper probabilities
for systems where only contextual hidden variables are possible.
