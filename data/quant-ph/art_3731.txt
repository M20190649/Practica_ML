Generation of eigenstates using the phase-estimation algorithm
The phase estimation algorithm is so named because it allows the estimation
of the eigenvalues associated with an operator. However it has been proposed
that the algorithm can also be used to generate eigenstates. Here we extend
this proposal for small quantum systems, identifying the conditions under which
the phase estimation algorithm can successfully generate eigenstates. We then
propose an implementation scheme based on an ion trap quantum computer. This
scheme allows us to illustrate two simple examples, one in which the algorithm
effectively generates eigenstates, and one in which it does not.
