Improving the Efficiency of an Ideal Heat Engine: The Quantum
  Afterburner
By using a laser and maser in tandem, it is possible to obtain laser action
in the hot exhaust gases involved in heat engine operation. Such a "quantum
afterburner" involves the internal quantum states of working gas atoms or
molecules as well as the techniques of cavity quantum electrodynamics and is
therefore in the domain of quantum thermodynamics. As an example, it is shown
that Otto cycle engine performance can be improved beyond that of the "ideal"
Otto heat engine.
