Interfering resonances in a quantum billiard
We present a method for numerically obtaining the positions, widths and
wavefunctions of resonance states in a two dimensional billiard connected to a
waveguide. For a rectangular billiard, we study the dynamics of three resonance
poles lying separated from the other ones. As a function of increasing coupling
strength between the waveguide and the billiard two of the states become
trapped while the width of the third one continues to increase for all coupling
strengths. This behavior of the resonance poles is reflected in the time delay
function which can be studied experimentally.
