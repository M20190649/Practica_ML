Experimental Realization of Discrete Fourier Transformation on NMR
  Quantum Computer
We report experimental implementation of discrete Fourier transformation(DFT)
on a nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) quantum computer. Experimental results
agree with theoretical results. Using the pulse sequences we introduced, DFT
can be realized on any L-bit quantum number in principle.
