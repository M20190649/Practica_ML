Conditional two mode squeezed vacuum teleportation
We show, by making conditional measurements on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) squeezed vacuum, that one can improve the efficacy of teleportation for
both the position difference, momentum sum and number difference, phase sum
continuous variable teleportation protocols. We investigate the relative
abilities of the standard and conditional EPR states, and show that by
conditioning we can improve the fidelity of teleportation of coherent states
from below to above the $\bar{F} = 2/3$ boundary.
