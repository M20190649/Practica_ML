Poisson-Lie Structures and Quantisation with Constraints
We develop here a simple quantisation formalism that make use of Lie algebra
properties of the Poisson bracket. When the brackets $\{H,\phi_i\}$ and
$\{\phi_i,\phi_j\}$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian and $\phi_i$ are primary and
secondary constraints, can be expressed as functions of $H$ and $\phi_i$
themselves, the Poisson bracket defines a Poisson-Lie structure. When this
algebra has a finite dimension a system of first order partial differential
equations is established whose solutions are the observables of the theory. The
method is illustrated with a few examples.
