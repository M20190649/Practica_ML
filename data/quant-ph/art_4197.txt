Two-Photon Interferometry for High-Resolution Imaging
We discuss advantages of using non-classical states of light for two aspects
of optical imaging: creating of miniature images on photosensitive substrates,
which constitutes the foundation for optical lithography, and imaging of micro
objects. In both cases, the classical resolution limit given by the Rayleigh
criterion is approximately a half of the optical wavelength. It has been shown,
however, that by using multi-photon quantum states of the light field, and
multi-photon sensitive material or detector, this limit can be surpassed. We
give a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of this problem, address some
particularly widespread misconceptions and discuss the requirements for turning
the research on quantum imaging into a practical technology.
