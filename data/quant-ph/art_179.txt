Simple Proof of Invariance of the Bargmann-Wigner Scalar Products
An explicitly covariant formalism for dealing with Bargmann-Wigner fields is
developed. An invariance of the Barmann-Wigner norm can be proved in a unified
way for both massive and massless fields. It is shown that there exists some
freedom in the choice of the form of the Bargmann-Wigner scalar product.
