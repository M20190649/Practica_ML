Squeezed light from microstructured fibres: towards free space quantum
  cryptography
Amplitude squeezed pulsed light has been produced using a microstructured
silica fibre. By spectrally filtering after the nonlinear propagation in the
fibre a squeezing value of -1.7dB has been measured. A quantum key distribution
scheme based on squeezed light from such microstructured fibres is proposed.
