Controlled entanglement of two field modes in a Cavity Quantum
  Electrodynamics experiment
Using a single circular Rydberg atom, we have prepared two modes of a
superconducting cavity in a maximally entangled state. The two modes share a
single photon. This entanglement is revealed by a second atom probing, after a
delay, the correlations between the two modes. This experiment opens
interesting perspectives for quantum information manipulation and fundamental
tests of quantum theory.
