Impulsive quantum measurements: restricted path integral versus von
  Neumann collapse
The relation between the restricted path integral approach to quantum
measurement theory and the commonly accepted von Neumann wavefunction collapse
postulate is presented. It is argued that in the limit of impulsive
measurements the two approaches lead to the same predictions. The example of
repeated impulsive quantum measurements of position performed on a harmonic
oscillator is discussed in detail and the quantum nondemolition strategies are
recovered in both the approaches.
