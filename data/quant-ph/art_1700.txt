Strong Converse to the Quantum Channel Coding Theorem
A lower bound on the probability of decoding error of quantum communication
channel is presented. The strong converse to the quantum channel coding theorem
is shown immediately from the lower bound. It is the same as Arimoto's method
exept for the difficulty due to non-commutativity.
