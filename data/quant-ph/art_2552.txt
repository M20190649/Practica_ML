Berry phase in the simple harmonic oscillator
Berry phase of simple harmonic oscillator is considered in a general
representation. It is shown that, Berry phase which depends on the choice of
representation can be defined under evolution of the half of period of the
classical motions, as well as under evolution of the period. The Berry phases
do {\em not} depend on the mass or angular frequency of the oscillator. The
driven harmonic oscillator is also considered, and the Berry phase is given in
terms of Fourier coefficients of the external force and parameters which
determine the representation.
