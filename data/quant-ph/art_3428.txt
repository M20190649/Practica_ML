Perturbative method for generalized spectral decompositions
Imposing analytic properties to states and observables we construct a
perturbative method to obtain a generalized biorthogonal system of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors for quantum unstable systems. A decay process can be described
using this generalized spectral decomposition, and the final generalized state
is obtained.
