Observation of the Quantum Zeno and Anti-Zeno effects in an unstable
  system
We report the first observation of the Quantum Zeno and Anti-Zeno effects in
an unstable system. Cold sodium atoms are trapped in a far-detuned standing
wave of light that is accelerated for a controlled duration. For a large
acceleration the atoms can escape the trapping potential via tunneling.
Initially the number of trapped atoms shows strong non-exponential decay
features, evolving into the characteristic exponential decay behavior. We
repeatedly measure the number of atoms remaining trapped during the initial
period of non-exponential decay. Depending on the frequency of measurements we
observe a decay that is suppressed or enhanced as compared to the unperturbed
system.
