Experimental requirements for quantum communication complexity protocols
I present a simple two-party quantum communication complexity protocol with
higher success rate than the best possible classical protocol for the same
task. The quantum protocol is shown to be equivalent to a quantum non-locality
test, except that it is not necessary to close the locality loophole. I derive
bounds for the detector efficiency and background count rates necessary for an
experimental implementation and show that they are close to what can be
currently achieved using ion trap technology. I also analyze the requirements
for a three-party protocol and show that they are less demanding than those for
the two-party protocol. The results can be interpreted as sufficient
experimental conditions for quantum non-locality tests using two or three
entangled qubits.
