A pragmatic approach to the problem of the self-adjoint extension of
  Hamilton operators with the Aharonov-Bohm potential
We consider the problem of self-adjoint extension of Hamilton operators for
charged quantum particles in the pure Aharonov-Bohm potential (infinitely thin
solenoid). We present a pragmatic approach to the problem based on the
orthogonalization of the radial solutions for different quantum numbers. Then
we discuss a model of a scalar particle with a magnetic moment which allows to
explain why the self-adjoint extension contains arbitrary parameters and give a
physical interpretation.
