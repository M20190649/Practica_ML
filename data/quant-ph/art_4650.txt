Mindless Sensationalism: A Quantum Framework for Consciousness
The ideas of Sensible Quantum Mechanics are expressed in lay terms for
philosophers of consciousness and others. A framework is proposed and explained
for the `psycho-physical-parallelism' between conscious experiences and the
mathematical structures of quantum physics (e.g., a set of quantum operators
obeying some algebra, and a quantum state giving the expectation value of each
operator). In particular, it is proposed that each set of possible conscious
experiences has a measure given by the expectation value of a corresponding
operator (a positive-operator-valued measure). Then one has a generalization of
the Weak Anthropic Principle named the Conditional Aesthemic Principle: given
that we are conscious beings, our conscious experiences are likely to be
typical experiences in the set of all conscious experiences with its measure.
