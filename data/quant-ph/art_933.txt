Born's principle and Action-Reaction problem
In a recent paper, A.Valentini tried to obtain Born's principle as a result
of a subquantum heat death, using classical H-theorem and the definition of a
proper quantum H-theorem within the framwork of Bohm's theory. In this paper,
we shall show the possibility of solving the problem of action-reaction
asymmetry present in Bohm's theory by modifying Valentini's procedure. However,
we get his main result too.
