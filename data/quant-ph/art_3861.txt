Iterative algorithm for reconstruction of entangled states
An iterative algorithm for the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state
from the results of incompatible measurements is proposed. It consists of
Expectation-Maximization step followed by a unitary transformation of the
eigenbasis of the density matrix. The procedure has been applied to the
reconstruction of the entangled pair of photons.
