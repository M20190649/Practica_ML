Implications of invariance of the Hamiltonian under canonical
  transformations in phase space
We observe that, within the effective generating function formalism for the
implementation of canonical transformations within wave mechanics, non-trivial
canonical transformations which leave invariant the form of the Hamilton
function of the classical analogue of a quantum system manifest themselves in
an integral equation for its stationary state eigenfunctions. We restrict
ourselves to that subclass of these dynamical symmetries for which the
corresponding effective generating functions are necessaarily free of quantum
corrections. We demonstrate that infinite families of such transformations
exist for a variety of familiar conservative systems of one degree of freedom.
We show how the geometry of the canonical transformations and the symmetry of
the effective generating function can be exploited to pin down the precise form
of the integral equations for stationary state eigenfunctions. We recover
several integral equations found in the literature on standard special
functions of mathematical physics. We end with a brief discussion (relevant to
string theory) of the generalization to scalar field theories in 1+1
dimensions.
