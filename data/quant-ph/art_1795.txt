A Phase in a Coherent State Wave Function - Is It Always Irrelevant?
We point out that harmonic oscillator coherent states, in coordinate
representation, require particular phase factor, in order to represent
classical time evolution properly. The presence of such a phase is clearly
stated only in a minority of scientific sources discussing properties of
coherent states.
