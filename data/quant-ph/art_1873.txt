Transition times in the Landau-Zener model
This paper presents analytic formulas for various transition times in the
Landau-Zener model. Considerable differences are found between the transition
times in the diabatic and adiabatic bases, and between the jump time (the time
for which the transition probability rises to the region of its asymptotic
value) and the relaxation time (the characteristic damping time of the
oscillations which appear in the transition probability after the crossing).
These transition times have been calculated by using the exact values of the
transition probabilities and their derivatives at the crossing point and
approximations to the time evolutions of the transition probabilities in the
diabatic basis, derived earlier \protect{[}N. V. Vitanov and B. M. Garraway,

adiabatic basis, derived in the present paper.
