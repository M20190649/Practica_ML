Measuring the entanglement of bipartite pure states
The problem of the experimental determination of the amount of entanglement
of a bipartite pure state is addressed. We show that measuring a single
observable does not suffice to determine the entanglement of a given unknown
pure state of two particles. Possible minimal local measuring strategies are
discussed and a comparison is made on the basis of their best achievable
precision.
