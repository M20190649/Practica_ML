Schumacher's quantum data compression as a quantum computation
An explicit algorithm for performing Schumacher's noiseless compression of
quantum bits is given. This algorithm is based on a combinatorial expression
for a particular bijection among binary strings. The algorithm, which adheres
to the rules of reversible programming, is expressed in a high-level pseudocode
language. It is implemented using $O(n^3)$ two- and three-bit primitive
reversible operations, where $n$ is the length of the qubit strings to be
compressed. Also, the algorithm makes use of $O(n)$ auxiliary qubits; however,
space-saving techniques based on those proposed by Bennett are developed which
reduce this workspace to $O(\sqrt{n})$ while increasing the running time by
less than a factor of two.
