Understanding Spin: the field theory of magnetic interactions
Spin is commonly thought to reflect the true quantum nature of microphysics.
We show that spin is related to intrinsic and field-like properties of single
particles. These properties change continuously in external magnetic fields.
Interactions of massive particles with homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields
result in two discrete particle states, symmetric to the original one. We
analyze the difficulties in quantum mechanics to give a precise spacetime
account of the experiments and find that they arise from unsuitable analogies
for spin. In particular from the analogy of an angular momentum. Several
experiments are suggested to check the model against the standard model in
quantum mechanics.
