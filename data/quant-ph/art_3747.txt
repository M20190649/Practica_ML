Security of EPR-based Quantum Key Distribution using three bases
Modifications to a previous proof of the security of EPR-based quantum key
distribution are proposed. This modified version applies to a protocol using
three conjugate measurement bases rather than two. A higher tolerable error
rate is obtained for the three-basis protocol.
