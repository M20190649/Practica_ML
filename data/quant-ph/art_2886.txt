Comment on the "Maxwell Equations as the One-Photon Quantum Equation" by
  A. Gersten [Found. Phys. Lett. 12, pp. 291-298 (1999)]
We show that the Gersten derivation of Maxwell equations can be generalized.
It actually leads to additional solutions of `S=1 equations'. They follow
directly from previous considerations by Majorana, Oppenheimer, Weinberg and
Ogievetskii and Polubarinov. Therefore, {\it generalized} Maxwell equations
should be used as a guideline for proper interpretations of quantum theories.
