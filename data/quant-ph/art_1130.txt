On the computation of quantum characteristic exponents
A quantum characteristic exponent may be defined, with the same operational
meaning as the classical Lyapunov exponent when the latter is expressed as a
functional of densities. Existence conditions and supporting measure properties
are discussed as well as the problems encountered in the numerical computation
of the quantum exponents. Although an example of true quantum chaos may be
exhibited, the taming effect of quantum mechanics on chaos is quite apparent in
the computation of the quantum exponents. However, even when the exponents
vanish, the functionals used for their definition may still provide a
characterization of distinct complexity classes for quantum behavior.
