New Invariants and Separability Criterion of the Mixed States:
  Multipartite Case
We introduce algebraic sets in the products of complex projective spaces for
the mixed states in multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under
local unitary operations. The algebraic sets have to be the union of the linear
subspaces if the state is separable. Some examples are studied based on our
criterion
