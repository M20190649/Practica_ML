Complementarity and the uncertainty relations
We formulate a general complementarity relation starting from any Hermitian
operator with discrete non-degenerate eigenvalues. We then elucidate the
relationship between quantum complementarity and the Heisenberg-Robertson's
uncertainty relation. We show that they are intimately connected. Finally we
exemplify the general theory with some specific suggested experiments.
