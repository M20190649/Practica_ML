Chaos in the Quantum Double Well Oscillator: The Ehrenfest View
  Revisited
We treat the double well quantum oscillator from the standpoint of the
Ehrenfest equation but in a manner different from Pattanayak and Schieve. We
show that for short times there can be chaotic motion due to quantum
fluctuations, but over sufficiently long times the behaviour is normal.
