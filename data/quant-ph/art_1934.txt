Two-photon Franson-type interference experiments are not tests of local
  realism
We report a local hidden-variable model which reproduces quantum predictions
for the two-photon interferometric experiment proposed by Franson [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 62, 2205 (1989)]. The model works for the ideal case of full visibility
and perfect detection efficiency. This result changes the interpretation of a
series of experiments performed in the current decade.
