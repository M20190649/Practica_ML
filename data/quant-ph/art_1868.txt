Reducing spatially correlated noise and decoherence with quantum error
  correcting codes
It is shown that the noise process in quantum computation can be described by
spatially correlated decoherence and dissipation. We demonstrate that the
conventional quantum error correcting codes correcting for single-qubit errors
are applicable for reducing spatially correlated noise.
