Why the Disjunction in Quantum Logic is Not Classical
The quantum logical `or' is analyzed from a physical perspective. We show
that it is the existence of EPR-like correlation states for the quantum
mechanical entity under consideration that make it nonequivalent to the
classical situation. Specifically, the presence of potentiality in these
correlation states gives rise to the quantum deviation from the classical
logical `or'. We show how this arises not only in the microworld, but also in
macroscopic situations where EPR-like correlation states are present. We
investigate how application of this analysis to concepts could alleviate some
well known problems in cognitive science.
