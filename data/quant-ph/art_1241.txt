A quantum-mechanical study of optical regenerators based on
  nonlinear-loop mirrors
We present a quantum-mechanical analysis of a nonlinear interferometer that
achieves optical switching via cross-phase modulation resulting from the Kerr
effect. We show how it performs as a very precise optical regenerator, highly
improving the transmitted bit-error rate in the presence of loss.
