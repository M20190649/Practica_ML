Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory XI: Thermodynamics and
  Equilibrium
In this continuation paper the theory is further extended to reveal the
connection between its formal aparatus, dealing with microscopic quantities,
and the formal aparatus of thermodynamics, related to macroscopic properties of
large systems. We will also derive the Born-Sommerfeld quantization rules from
the formalism of the infinitesimal Wigner-Moyal transformations and, as a
consequence of this result, we will also make a connection between the later
and the path integral approach of Feynman. Some insights of the relation
between quantum mechanics and equilibrium states will be given as a natural
development of the interpretation of the above results.
