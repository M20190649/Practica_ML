On Rotating a Qubit
The state function of a quantum object is undetermined with respect to its
phase. This indeterminacy does not matter if it is global, but what if the
components of the state have unknown relative phases? Can useful computations
be performed in spite of this local indeterminacy? We consider this question in
relation to the problem of the rotation of a qubit and examine its broader
implications for quantum computing.
