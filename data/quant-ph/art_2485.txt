Entanglement Teleportation via Werner States
Transfer of entanglement and information is studied for quantum teleportation
of an unknown entangled state through noisy quantum channels. We find that the
quantum entanglement of the unknown state can be lost during the teleportation
even when the channel is quantum correlated. We introduce a fundamental
parameter of correlation information which dissipates linearly during the
teleportation through the noisy channel. Analyzing the transfer of correlation
information, we show that the purity of the initial state is important in
determining the entanglement of the replica state.
