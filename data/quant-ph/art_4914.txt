Conventions in relativity theory and quantum mechanics
The conventionalistic aspects of physical world perception are reviewed with
an emphasis on the constancy of the speed of light in relativity theory and the
irreversibility of measurements in quantum mechanics. An appendix contains a
complete proof of Alexandrov's theorem using mainly methods of affine geometry.
