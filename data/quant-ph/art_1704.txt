Asymptotic quantum estimation theory for the displaced thermal states
  family
Concerning state estimation, we will compare two cases. In one case we cannot
use the quantum correlations between samples. In the other case, we can use
them. In addition, under the later case, we will propose a method which
simultaneously measures the complex amplitude and the expected photon number
for the displaced thermal states.
