Entanglement swapping with PDC sources
We show that the possibility of distinguishing between single and two photon
detection events is not a necessary requirement for the proof that recent
operational realization of entanglement swapping cannot find a local realistic
description. We propose a simple modification of the experiment, which gives a
richer set of interesting phenomena.
