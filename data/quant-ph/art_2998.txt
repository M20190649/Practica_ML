Optical Realization of Quantum Gambling Machine
Quantum gambling --- a secure remote two-party protocol which has no
classical counterpart --- is demonstrated through optical approach. A photon is
prepared by Alice in a superposition state of two potential paths. Then one
path leads to Bob and is split into two parts. The security is confirmed by
quantum interference between Alice's path and one part of Bob's path. It is
shown that a practical quantum gambling machine can be feasible by this way.
