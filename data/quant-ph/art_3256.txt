Remark on multi-particle observables and entangled states with constant
  complexity
We show that every density matrix of an n-particle system prepared by a
quantum network of constant depth is asymptotically commuting with the
mean-field observables. We introduce certain pairs of hypersurfaces in the
space of density matrices and give lower bounds for the depth of a network
which prepares states lying outside those pairs. The measurement of an
observable which is not asymptotically commuting with the mean-field
observables requires a network of depth in the order of log n, if one demands
the measurement to project the state into the eigenspace of the measured
observable.
