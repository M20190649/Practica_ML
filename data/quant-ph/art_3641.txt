All inseparable two-mode Gaussian continuous variable states are
  distillable
We show that all entangled Gaussian states of two infinite dimensional
systems can be distilled to maximally entangled states in finite dimensions.
The distillation protocol involves local squeezing operations, local homodyne
measurements with ancilla systems prepared in coherent states as well as local
joint measurements of the total number operator of two copies of the state.
