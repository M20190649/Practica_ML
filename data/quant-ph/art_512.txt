Dichotomic Functions and Bell's Theorems
It is shown that correlations of dichotomic functions can not conform to
results from Quantum Mechanics. Also, it is seen that the assumptions attendant
to optical tests of Bell's Inequalities actually are consistent with classical
physics so that in conclusion, Bell's Theorems do not preclude hidden variable
interpretations of Quantum Mechanics.
