Discrete formulation of teleportation of continuous variables
Teleportation of continuous variables can be described in two different ways,
one in terms of Wigner functions, the other in terms of discrete basis states.
The latter formulation provides the connection between the theory of
teleportation of continuous degrees of freedom of a light field and the
standard description of teleportation of discrete variables.
