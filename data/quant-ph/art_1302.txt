Enlargement of Calderbank Shor Steane quantum codes
It is shown that a classical error correcting code C = [n,k,d] which contains
its dual, C^{\perp} \subseteq C, and which can be enlarged to C' = [n,k' > k+1,
d'], can be converted into a quantum code of parameters [[ n, k+k' - n, min(d,
3d'/2) ]]. This is a generalisation of a previous construction, it enables many
new codes of good efficiency to be discovered. Examples based on classical Bose
Chaudhuri Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are discussed.
