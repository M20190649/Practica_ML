True Collapse and False Collapse
We emphasize that standard quantum theory (SQT) is incomplete because it
doesn't describe what is experimentally observed, namely events, nor does it
satisfactorily define the circumstances under which events may occur. Simple
models are given (all of which have the same density matrix evolution) to
illustrate schemes which claim to complete SQT. It is shown how the model based
upon the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) theory, in which an
individual statevector undergoes "True Collapse," gives a satisfactory
description of events. It is argued that various "decoherence" based
approaches, illustrated by models in which a density matrix undergoes "False
Collapse," do not satisfactorily resolve these problems of SQT.
