"Assisted cloning'' and "orthogonal-complementing" of an unknown state
We propose a protocol where one can exploit dual quantum and classical
channels to achieve perfect ``cloning'' and ``orthogonal-complementing'' of an
unknown state with a minimal assistance from a state preparer (without
revealing what the input state is). The first stage of the protocol requires
usual teleportation and in the second stage, the preparer disentangles the
left-over entangled states by a single particle measurement process and
communicates a number of classical bits (1-cbit per copy) to different parties
so that perfect copies and complement copies are produced. We discuss our
protocol for producing two copies and three copies (and complement copies)
using two and four particle entangled state and suggest how to generalise this
for N copies and complement copies using multiparticle entangled state.
