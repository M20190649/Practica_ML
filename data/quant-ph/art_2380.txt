Vectors and Operators For Spin 1 Derived From First Principles
In this paper, we extend to the case of spin 1 the method we have devised for
deriving generalized spin quantities from first principles, and which we
illustrated using the spin-1/2 case. Again, we not only derive from first
principles the standard results but we obtain new generalized results as well.
Our success in doing this shows that our method is of general validity and can
be applied to any value of J.
