q deformation by intertwining with application to the singular
  oscillator
We present a version of q-deformed calculus based on deformed counterparts of
Darboux intertwining operators. The case in which the deformed transformation
function is of the vacuum type is detailed, but the extension to counterparts
of excited states used as Darboux transformation functions is also formally
discussed. The method leads to second-order Fokker-Planck-like deformed
operators which may be considered as supersymmetric partners, though for a sort
of q-deformed open systems, i.e., those possessing q nonlocal drift terms,
potential part, as well as q-spreaded vacuum fluctuations. The undeformed limit
corresponds to the conservative case, since all q nonlocalities wash out. The
procedure is applied to the x^{-2} singular oscillator, for which we also
present a formal q generalization of the Bagrov-Samsonov coherent states
