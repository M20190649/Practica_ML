The Universe of Chaos and Quanta
In recent papers it was shown that stochastic processes in the universe as a
whole lead to discrete space time at Compton scales as also non-relativistic
Quantum Mechanics. In this paper, we deduce the Dirac equation and thence a
unified formulation of quarks and leptons. In the process several puzzling
empirical results and coincidences are shown to be a consequence of the theory.
These include the discreteness of the charge, handedness of quarks, their
fractional charge, confinement and masses and the handedness of neutrinos, the
so called accidental relation that the classical Kerr- Newman metric describes,
the field of an electron including the purely quantum mechanical gyromagnetic
ratio g=2, as also the many large number coincidences made famous by Dirac and
Weinberg's mysterious empirical formula that relates the pion mass to the
Hubble Constant. A cosmology based on fluctuations related to the above
stochastic space-time discretization, consistent with latest observations is
also seen to follow.
