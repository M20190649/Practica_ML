Continuously Measured Systems,Path Integrals and Information
A continuously measured quantum system may be described by restricted path
integrals (RPI) or equivalently by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The measured
system is then considered as an open system, the influence of the environment
being taken into account by restricting the path integral or by inclusion of an
imaginary part in the Hamiltonian. This way of description of measurements
naturally follows from the Feynman form of quantum mechanics without any
additional postulates and may be interpreted as an information approach to
continuous quantum measurements. This reveals deep features of quantum physics
concerning relations between quantum world and its classical appearance.
