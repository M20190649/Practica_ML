Experimental NMR Realization of A Generalized Quantum Search Algorithm
A generalized quantum search algorithm, where phase inversions for the marked
state and the prepared state are replaced by $\pi/2$ phase rotations, is
realized in a 2-qubit NMR heteronuclear system. The quantum algorithm searches
a marked state with a smaller step compared to standard Grover algorithm. Phase
matching requirement in quantum searching is demonstrated by comparing it with
another generalized algorithm where the two phase rotations are $\pi/2$ and
$3\pi/2$ respectively. Pulse sequences which include non 90 degree pulses are
given.
