Effect of Decoherence on Bell's Inequality for an EPR Pair
According to Bell's theorem, the degree of correlation between spatially
separated measurements on a quantum system is limited by certain inequalities
if one assumes the condition of locality. Quantum mechanics predicts that this
limit can be exceeded, making it nonlocal. We analyse the effect of an
environment modelled by a fluctuating magnetic field on the quantum
correlations in an EPR singlet as seen in the Bell inequality. We show that in
an EPR setup, the system goes from the usual 'violation' of Bell inequality to
a 'non-violation' for times larger than a characteristic time scale which is
related to the parameters of the fluctuating field. We also look at these
inequalities as a function of the spatial separation between the EPR pair.
