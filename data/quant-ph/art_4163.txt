An analysis of a two-atom double-slit experiment based on
  environment-induced measurements
To investigate the effect of a classical environment on a quantum mechanical
system we consider two two-level atoms in a free radiation field in the
presence of a screen. By assuming that the screen causes continuous ideal
measurements on the free radiation field we derive a quantum jump description
for the state of the atoms. Our results are consistent with the master
equations for dipole interacting atoms, but give more insight in the time
evolution of a single system. To illustrate this we derive a necessary and
sufficient criterion for interference in a two-atom double-slit experiment and
analyse bunching in the statistics of photons emitted in a certain direction.
