Complete Characterization of a Quantum Process: the Two-Bit Quantum Gate
We show how to fully characterize a quantum process in an open quantum
system. We particularize the procedure to the case of a universal two-qubit
gate in a quantum computer. We illustrate the method with a numerical
simulation of a quantum gate in the ion trap quantum computer.
