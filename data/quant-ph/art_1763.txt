An improved bound on distillable entanglement
The best bound known on 2-locally distillable entanglement is that of Vedral
and Plenio, involving a certain measure of entanglement based on relative
entropy. It turns out that a related argument can be used to give an even
stronger bound; we give this bound, and examine some of its properties. In
particular, and in contrast to the earlier bounds, the new bound is not
additive in general. We give an example of a state for which the bound fails to
be additive, as well as a number of states for which the bound is additive.
