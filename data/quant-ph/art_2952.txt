Half Quantization
A general dynamical system composed by two coupled sectors is considered. The
initial time configuration of one of these sectors is described by a set of
classical data while the other is described by standard quantum data. These
dynamical systems will be named half quantum. The aim of this paper is to
derive the dynamical evolution of a general half quantum system from its full
quantum formulation. The standard approach would be to use quantum mechanics to
make predictions for the time evolution of the half quantum initial data. The
main problem is how can quantum mechanics be applied to a dynamical system
whose initial time configuration is not described by a set of fully quantum
data. A solution to this problem is presented and used, as a guideline to
obtain a general formulation of coupled classical-quantum dynamics. Finally, a
quantization prescription mapping a given classical theory to the correspondent
half quantum one is presented.
