NMR Quantum Automata in Doped Crystals
In a lattice ${\cal L}$ of nuclear spins with ABCABCABC... type periodic
structure embedded in a single-crystal solid, each ABC-unit can be used to
store quantum information and the information can be moved around via some
cellular shifting mechanism. Impurity doping marks a special site
D$\not\in{\cal L}$ which together with the local spin lattice constitute a
quantum automaton where the D site serves as the input/output port and
universal quantum logic is done through two-body interactions between two spins
at D and a nearby site. The novel NMR quantum computer can be easily scaled up
and may work at low temperature to overcome the problem of exponential decay in
signal-to-noise ratio in room temperature NMR.
