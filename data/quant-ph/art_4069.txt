Light-shift-induced quantum gates for ions in thermal motion
An effective interaction between trapped ions in thermal motion can be
generated by illuminating them simultaneously with a single laser resonant with
the ionic carrier frequency. The ac Stark-shift induces simultaneous `virtual'
two-phonon transitions via several motional modes. Within a certain laser
intensity range these transitions can interfere constructively, resulting in a
relatively fast, heating-resistant two-qubit logic gate.
