Quantum chaos in quantum Turing machines
We investigate a 2-spin quantum Turing architecture, in which discrete local
rotations \alpha_m of the Turing head spin alternate with quantum controlled
NOT-operations. We demonstrate that a single chaotic parameter input \alpha_m
leads to a chaotic dynamics in the entire Hilbert-space.
