Generalized Noiseless Quantum Codes utilizing Quantum Enveloping
  Algebras
A generalization of the results of Rasetti and Zanardi concerning avoiding
errors in quantum computers by using states preserved by evolution is
presented. The concept of dynamical symmetry is generalized from the level of
classical Lie algebras and groups to the level of dynamical symmetry based on
quantum Lie algebras and quantum groups (in the sense of Woronowicz). A natural
connection is proved between states preserved by representations of a quantum
group and states preserved by evolution with dynamical symmetry of the
appropriate universal enveloping algebra. Illustrative examples are discussed.
