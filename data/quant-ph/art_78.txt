Discrete photodetection and Susskind-Glogower ladder operators
We assert that state reduction processes in different types of photodetection
experiments are described by using different kinds of ladder operators. A
special model of discrete photodetection is developed by the use of
superoperators which are based on the Susskind-Glogower raising and lowering
operators.
