Consistent Quantum Realism: A Reply to Bassi and Ghirardi
A recent claim by Bassi and Ghirardi that the consistent (decoherent)
histories approach cannot provide a realistic interpretation of quantum theory
is shown to be based upon a misunderstanding of the single-framework rule: they
have replaced the correct rule with a principle which directly contradicts it.
It is their assumptions, not those of the consistent histories approach, which
lead to a logical contradiction.
