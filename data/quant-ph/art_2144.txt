Coherent states of the creation operator from fully developed
  Bose-Einstein condensates
A fully developed Bose-Einstein condensate, containing macroscopically large
number of bosons can under certain conditions be considered as a generalized
vacuum state. Applying the annihilation operator to the condensate, hole states
can be defined. Infinite ladders of such hole states can be considered as
generalized coherent states of the creation operator. Dedicated to the memory
of V. N. Gribov.
