Distillation of GHZ states by selective information manipulation
Methods for distilling maximally entangled tripartite (GHZ) states from
arbitrary entangled tripartite pure states are described. These techniques work
for virtually any input state. Each technique has two stages which we call
primary and secondary distillation. Primary distillation produces a GHZ state
with some probability, so that when applied to an ensemble of systems, a
certain percentage is discarded. Secondary distillation produces further GHZs
from the discarded systems. These protocols are developed with the help of an
approach to quantum information theory based on absolutely selective
information, which has other potential applications.
