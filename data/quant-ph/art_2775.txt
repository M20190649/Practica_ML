Quantum Cryptography using larger alphabets
Like all of quantum information theory, quantum cryptography is traditionally
based on two level quantum systems. In this letter, a new protocol for quantum
key distribution based on higher dimensional systems is presented. An
experimental realization using an interferometric setup is also proposed.
Analyzing this protocol from the practical side, one finds an increased key
creation rate while keeping the initial laser pulse rate constant. Analyzing it
for the case of intercept/resend eavesdropping strategy, an increased error
rate is found compared to two dimensional systems, hence an advantage for the
legitimate users to detect an eavesdropper.
