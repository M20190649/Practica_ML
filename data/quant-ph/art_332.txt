Quantum Cryptographic Network based on Quantum Memories
Quantum correlations between two particles show non-classical properties
which can be used for providing secure transmission of information. We present
a quantum cryptographic system, in which users store particles in quantum
memories kept in a transmission center. Correlations between the particles
stored by two users are created upon request by projecting their product state
onto a fully entangled state. Our system allows for secure communication
between any pair of users who have particles in the same center. Unlike other
quantum cryptographic systems, it can work without quantum channels and is
suitable for building a quantum cryptographic network. We also present a
modified system with many centers.
