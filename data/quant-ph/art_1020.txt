An open systems approach to calculating time dependent spectra
A new method to calculate the spectrum using cascaded open systems and master
equations is presented. The method uses two state analyzer atoms which are
coupled to the system of interest, whose spectrum of radiation is read from the
excitation of these analyzer atoms. The ordinary definitions of a spectrum uses
two-time averages and Fourier-transforms. The present method uses only one-time
averages. The method can be used to calculate time dependent as well as
stationary spectra.
