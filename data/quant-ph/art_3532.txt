On Galilean invariance and nonlinearity in electrodynamics and quantum
  mechanics
Recent experimental results on slow light heighten interest in nonlinear
Maxwell theories. We obtain Galilei covariant equations for electromagnetism by
allowing special nonlinearities in the constitutive equations only, keeping
Maxwell's equations unchanged. Combining these with linear or nonlinear
Schroedinger equations, e.g. as proposed by Doebner and Goldin, yields a
Galilean quantum electrodynamics.
