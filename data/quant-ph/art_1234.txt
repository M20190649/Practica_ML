The Casimir force for passive mirrors
We show that the Casimir force between mirrors with arbitrary frequency
dependent reflectivities obeys bounds due to causality and passivity
properties. The force is always smaller than the Casimir force between two
perfectly reflecting mirrors. For narrow-band mirrors in particular, the force
is found to decrease with the mirrors bandwidth.
