Quantum Error Correction via Codes over GF(4)
The problem of finding quantum error-correcting codes is transformed into the
problem of finding additive codes over the field GF(4) which are
self-orthogonal with respect to a certain trace inner product. Many new codes
and new bounds are presented, as well as a table of upper and lower bounds on
such codes of length up to 30 qubits.
