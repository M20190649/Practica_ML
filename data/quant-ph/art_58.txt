Stronger-than-quantum correlations
After an elementary derivation of Bell's inequality, several forms of
expectation functions for two-valued observables are discussed. Special
emphasis is given to hypothetical stronger-than quantum expectation functions
which give rise to a maximal violation of Bell's inequality.
