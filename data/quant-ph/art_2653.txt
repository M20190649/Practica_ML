Quantum state engineering on an optical transition and decoherence in a
  Paul trap
A single Ca+ ion in a Paul trap has been cooled to the ground state of
vibration with up to 99.9% probability. Starting from this Fock state |n=0> we
have demonstrated coherent quantum state manipulation on an optical transition.
Up to 30 Rabi oscillations within 1.4 ms have been observed. We find a similar
number of Rabi oscillations after preparation of the ion in the |n=1> Fock
state. The coherence of optical state manipulation is only limited by laser and
ambient magnetic field fluctuations. Motional heating has been measured to be
as low as one vibrational quantum in 190 ms.
