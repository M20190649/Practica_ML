Entangled light from white noise
An atom that couples to two distinct leaky optical cavities is driven by an
external optical white noise field. We describe how entanglement between the
light fields sustained by two optical cavities arises in such a situation. The
entanglement is maximized for intermediate values of the cavity damping rates
and the intensity of the white noise field, vanishing both for small and for
large values of these parameters and thus exhibiting a
stochastic-resonance-like behaviour. This example illustrates the possibility
of generating entanglement by exclusively incoherent means and sheds new light
on the constructive role noise may play in certain tasks of interest for
quantum information processing.
