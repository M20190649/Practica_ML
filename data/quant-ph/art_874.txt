Time development of a wave packet and the time delay
A one-dimensional scattering problem off a $\delta$-shaped potential is
solved analytically and the time development of a wave packet is derived from
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The exact and explicit expression of
the scattered wave packet supplies us with interesting information about the
"time delay" by potential scattering in the asymptotic region. It is
demonstrated that a wave packet scattered by a spin-flipping potential can give
us quite a different value for the delay times from that obtained without
spin-degrees of freedom.
