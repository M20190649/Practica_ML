Adiabatic Elimination in Compound Quantum Systems with Feedback
Feedback in compound quantum systems is effected by using the output from one
sub-system (``the system'') to control the evolution of a second sub-system
(``the ancilla'') which is reversibly coupled to the system. In the limit where
the ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the
system, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master
equation for the system alone. This is very significant as it decreases the
necessary basis size for numerical simulation and allows the effect of the
ancilla to be understood more easily. We consider two types of ancilla: a
two-level ancilla (e.g. a two-level atom) and an infinite-level ancilla (e.g.
an optical mode). For each, we consider two forms of feedback: coherent (for
which a quantum mechanical description of the feedback loop is required) and
incoherent (for which a classical description is sufficient). We test the
master equations we obtain using numerical simulation of the full dynamics of
the compound system. For the system (a parametric oscillator) and feedback
(intensity-dependent detuning) we choose, good agreement is found in the limit
of heavy damping of the ancilla. We discuss the relation of our work to
previous work on feedback in compound quantum systems, and also to previous
work on adiabatic elimination in general.
