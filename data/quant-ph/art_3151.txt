Optimal quantum teleportation with an arbitrary pure state
We derive the maximum fidelity attainable for teleportation using a shared
pair of d-level systems in an arbitrary pure state. This derivation provides a
complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal teleportation
protocols. We also discuss the information on the teleported particle which is
revealed in course of the protocol using a non-maximally entangled state.
