Bound entanglement can be activated
Bound entanglement is the noisy entanglement which cannot be distilled to a
singlet form. Thus it cannot be used alone for quantum communication purposes.
Here we show that, nevertheless, the bound entanglement can be, in a sense,
pumped into single pair of free entangled particles. It allows for
teleportation via the pair with the fidelity impossible to achieve without
support of bound entanglement. The result also suggests that the distillable
entanglement may be not additive.
