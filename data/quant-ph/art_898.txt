A Polynomial-Time Quantum Algorithm for Collision Problem
In this paper, we give a quantum algorithm which solves collision problem in
an expected polynomial time. Especially, when the function is two-to-one, we
present a quantum algorithm which can find a collision with certainty in a
worst-case polynomial time. We also give a quantum algorithm which solves claw
problem with certainty in a worst-case polynomial time.
