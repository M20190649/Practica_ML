Improved Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force Using Gold Surfaces
We report an improved precision measurement of the Casimir force using
metallic gold surfaces. The force is measured between a large gold coated
sphere and flat plate using an Atomic Force Microscope. The use of gold
surfaces removes some theoretical uncertainties in the interpretation of the
measurement. The forces are also measured at smaller surface separations. The
complete dielectric spectrum of the metal is used in the comparison of theory
to the experiment. The average statistical precision remains at the same 1% of
the forces measured at the closest separation. These results should lead to the
development of stronger constraints on hypothetical forces.
