A Heuristic Approach to the Relativistic Angular Momentum
The relativistic angular momentum is introduced as an extension of the
non-relativistic analysis of allowed states in the phase space for a quantum
particle. The paper shows the conceptual basis of the approach. An interesting
feature of the present point of view is that the indistinguishability of
identical particles and the Pauli principle are found as corollaries.
