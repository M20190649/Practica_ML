Entanglement purification of Gaussian continuous variable quantum states
We describe an entanglement purification protocol to generate maximally
entangled states with high efficiencies from two-mode squeezed states or from
mixed Gaussian continuous entangled states. The protocol relies on a local
quantum non-demolition measurement of the total excitation number of several
continuous variable entangled pairs. We propose an optical scheme to do this
kind of measurement using cavity enhanced cross--Kerr interactions.
