Quantum Telecomputation
Quantum mechanics permits certain kinds of non-local effects. This paper
demonstrates how these can be used for distributed computation with minimal
communication between various processors. The problem considered is that of
estimating the mean of N items to a certain precision. First a serial quantum
mechanical algorithm for this is presented that is faster than any classical
algorithm. Next it is shown how this can be efficiently parallelized with
quantum mechanical processors that are remotely located. These processors
consist of coupled EPR particles. Each processor has just to communicate one
bit of classical information to a central location at the end of its local
computation.
