Quantum times of arrival for multiparticle states
Using the concept of crossing state and the formalism of second quantization,
we propose a prescription for computing the density of arrivals of particles
for multiparticle states, both in the free and the interacting case. The
densities thus computed are positive, covariant in time for time independent
hamiltonians, normalized to the total number of arrivals, and related to the
flux. We investigate the behaviour of this prescriptions for bosons and
fermions, finding boson enhancement and fermion depletion of arrivals.
