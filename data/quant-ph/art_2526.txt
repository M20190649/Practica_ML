Spectrum of light scattered from a deformed Bose-Einstein condensate
The spectrum of light scattered from a Bose-Einstein condensate is studied in
the limit of particle-number conservation. To this end, a description in terms
of deformed bosons is invoked and this leads to a deviation from the usual
predict spectrum's shape as soon as the number of particles decreases.
