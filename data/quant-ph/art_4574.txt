Wehrl information entropy and phase distributions of Schrodinger cat and
  cat-like states
The Wehrl information entropy and its phase density, the so-called Wehrl
phase distribution, are applied to describe Schr\"odinger cat and cat-like
(kitten) states. The advantages of the Wehrl phase distribution over the Wehrl
entropy in a description of the superposition principle are presented. The
entropic measures are compared with a conventional phase distribution from the
Husimi Q-function. Compact-form formulae for the entropic measures are found
for superpositions of well-separated states. Examples of Schr\"odinger cats
(including even, odd and Yurke-Stoler coherent states), as well as the cat-like
states generated in Kerr medium are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, in
contrast to the Wehrl entropy, the Wehrl phase distribution properly
distinguishes between different superpositions of unequally-weighted states in
respect to their number and phase-space configuration.
