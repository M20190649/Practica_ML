Zero-energy states for a class of quasi-exactly solvable rational
  potentials
Quasi-exactly solvable rational potentials with known zero-energy solutions
of the Schro\" odinger equation are constructed by starting from exactly
solvable potentials for which the Schr\" odinger equation admits an so(2,1)
potential algebra. For some of them, the zero-energy wave function is shown to
be normalizable and to describe a bound state.
