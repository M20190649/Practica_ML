EPR Correlations as an Angular Hanbury-Brown--Twiss Effect
It is shown that EPR correlations are the angular analogue to the
Hanbury-Brown--Twiss effect. As insight provided by this model, it is seen
that, analysis of the EPR experiment requires conditional probabilities which
do not admit the derivation of Bell inequalities.
