State preparation by photon filtering
We propose a setup capable of generating Fock states of a single mode
radiation field. The scheme is based on coupling the signal field to a ring
cavity through cross-Kerr phase modulation, and on conditional ON-OFF
photodetection at the output cavity mode. The same setup allows to prepare
selected superpositions of Fock states and entangled two-mode states.
Remarkably, the detector's quantum efficiency does not affect the reliability
of the state synthesis.
