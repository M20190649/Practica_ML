High efficiency Nondistortion Quantum Interrogation of atoms in quantum
  superpositions
We consider the nondistortion quantum interrogation (NQI) of an atom prepared
in a quantum superposition. By manipulating the polarization of the probe
photon and making connections to interaction free measurements of opaque
objects, we show that nondistortion interrogation of an atom in a quantum
superposition can be done with efficiency approaching unity. However, if any
component of the atom's superposition is completely transparent to the probe
wave function, a nondistortion interrogation of the atom is impossible.
