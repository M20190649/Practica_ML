Dynamics for Density Operator Interpretations of Quantum Theory
We first introduce and discuss density operator interpretations of quantum
theory as a special case of a more general class of interpretations, giving
special attention to a version that we call the `atomic version'. We then
review some crucial parts of the theory of stochastic processes (the proper
context in which to discuss dynamics), and develop a general framework for
specifying a dynamics for density operator interpretations. This framework
admits infinitely many empirically equivalent dynamics. We give some examples,
and discuss some of the properties of one of them.
