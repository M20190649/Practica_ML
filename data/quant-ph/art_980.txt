The Los Alamos Trapped Ion Quantum Computer Experiment
The development and theory of an experiment to investigate quantum
computation with trapped calcium ions is described. The ion trap, laser and ion
requirements are determined, and the parameters required for quantum logic
operations as well as simple quantum factoring are described.
