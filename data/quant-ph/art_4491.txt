Comparative study of the transient evolution of Hanle EIT/EIA resonances
The temporal evolutions of coherent resonances corresponding to
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) were
observed in a Hanle absorption experiment carried on the $D_{2}$ lines of $%
^{87}$Rb vapor by suddenly turning the magnetic field on or off. The main
features of the experimental observations are well reproduced by a theoretical
model based on Bloch equation where the atomic level degeneracy has been fully
accounted for. Similar (opposite phase) evolutions were observed at low optical
field intensities for Hanle/EIT or Hanle/EIA resonances. Unlike the Hanle/EIA\
transients which are increasingly shorter for driving field intensities
approaching saturation, the $B\neq 0$ transient of the Hanle/EIT signal at
large driving field intensities present a long decay time approaching the
atomic transit time. Such counterintuitive behavior is interpreted as a
consequence of the Zeno effect.
