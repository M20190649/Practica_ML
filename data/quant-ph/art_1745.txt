Short survey of Darboux transformations
A selective chronological survey of Darboux transformations as related to
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, intertwining operators and inverse scattering
techniques is presented. Short comments are appended to each quotation and
basic concepts are explained in order to provide a useful primer
