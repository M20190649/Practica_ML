Deterministic entanglement of two trapped ions
We have prepared the internal states of two trapped ions in both the
Bell-like singlet and triplet entangled states. In contrast to all other
experiments with entangled states of either massive particles or photons, we do
this in a deterministic fashion, producing entangled states on demand without
selection. The deterministic production of entangled states is a crucial
prerequisite for large-scale quantum computation.
