Methods for Reliable Teleportation
Recent experimental results and proposals towards implementation of quantum
teleportation are discussed. It is proved that reliable (theoretically, 100%
probability of success) teleportation cannot be achieved using the methods
applied in recent experiments, i.e., without quantum systems interacting one
with the other. Teleportation proposal involving atoms and electro-magnetic
cavities are reviewed and the most feasible methods are described. In
particular, the language of nonlocal measurements has been applied which has
also been used for presenting a method for teleportation of quantum states of
systems with continuous variables.
