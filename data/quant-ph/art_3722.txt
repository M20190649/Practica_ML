The Time-Asymmetry and the Entropy Gap
The universe time-asymmetry is essentially produced by its low-entropy
unstable initial state. Using quanlitative arguments, Paul Davies has
demonstrated that the universe expansion may diminish the entropy gap,
therefore explaining its low-entropy state, with respect to the maximal
possible entropy at any time. This idea is implemented in a qualitative
way\thinspace in a simple homogeneous model. Some rough coincidence with
observational data are found
