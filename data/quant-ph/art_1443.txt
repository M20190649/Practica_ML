How to Compile A Quantum Bayesian Net
We show how to express the information contained in a Quantum Bayesian (QB)
net as a product of unitary matrices. If each of these unitary matrices is
expressed as a sequence of elementary operations (operations such as
controlled-nots and qubit rotations), then the result is a sequence of
operations that can be used to run a quantum computer. QB nets have been run
entirely on a classical computer, but one expects them to run faster on a
quantum computer.
