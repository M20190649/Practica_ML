Nonextensive approach to decoherence in quantum mechanics
We propose a nonextensive generalization (q parametrized) of the von Neumann
equation for the density operator. Our model naturally leads to the phenomenon
of decoherence, and unitary evolution is recovered in the limit of q -> 1. The
resulting evolution yields a nonexponential decay for quantum coherences, fact
that might be attributed to nonextensivity. We discuss, as an example, the loss
of coherence observed in trapped ions.
