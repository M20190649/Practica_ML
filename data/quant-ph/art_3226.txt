Subnormal operators regarded as generalized observables and
  compound-system-type normal extension related to su(1,1)
In this paper, subnormal operators, not necessarily bounded, are discussed as
generalized observables. In order to describe not only the information about
the probability distribution of the output data of their measurement but also a
framework of their implementations, we introduce a new concept
compound-system-type normal extension, and we derive the compound-system-type
normal extension of a subnormal operator, which is defined from an irreducible
unitary representation of the algebra su(1,1). The squeezed states are
characterized as the eigenvectors of an operator from this viewpoint, and the
squeezed states in multi-particle systems are shown to be the eigenvectors of
the adjoints of these subnormal operators under a representation. The affine
coherent states are discussed in the same context, as well.
