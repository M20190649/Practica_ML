The influence of density of modes on dark lines in spontaneous emission
We study two distinct multi-level atomic models in which one transition is
coupled to a Markovian reservoir, while another linked transition is coupled to
a non-Markovian reservoir. We show that by choosing appropriately the density
of modes of the non-Markovian reservoir the spontaneous emission to the
Markovian reservoir is greatly altered. The existence of `dark lines' in the
spontaneous emission spectrum in the Markovian reservoir due to the coupling to
specific density of modes of the non-Markovian reservoir is also predicted.
