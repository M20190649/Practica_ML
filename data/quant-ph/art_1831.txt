Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox without entanglement
We claim that the nonlocality without entanglement revealed quite recently by
Bennett {\it et al.} [quant-ph/9804053] should be rather interpreted as {\it
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox without entanglement}. It would be true
nonlocality without entanglement if one knew that quantum mechnics provides the
best possible means for extracting information from physical system i.e. that
it is ``operationally complete''.
