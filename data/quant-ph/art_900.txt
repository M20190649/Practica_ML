Density matrix interpretation of solutions of Lie-Nambu equations
The spectrum of a density matrix $\rho(t)$ is conserved by a Lie-Nambu
dynamics if $\rho(t)$ is a self-adjoint and Hilbert-Schmidt solution of a
nonlinear triple-bracket equation. This generalizes to arbitrary separable
(positive- and indefinite-metric) Hilbert spaces the previous result which was
valid for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
