Feasible Linear-optics Generation of Polarization-entangled Photons
  Assisted with Single-photon Quantum Non-demolition Measurement
We propose a feasible scheme to create $n$-party ($n\geq 2$)
polarization-entangled photon states in a controllable way. The scheme requires
only single-photon sources, single-photon quantum non-demolition measurement
(SP-QNDM) and simple linear optical elements, usually with high perfections.
The SP-QNDM acts as a non-destructive projection measurement onto the wanted
entangled states and filters out the unwanted terms. Our scheme in fact
realizes entanglement of non-interacting photons; the interaction occurs only
implicitly in the optical elements and SP-QNDM. We also briefly consider
purification of mixed single-photon states within our scheme.
