Revised Proof of the Uniqueness Theorem for 'No Collapse'
  Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics
We show that the Bub-Clifton uniqueness theorem for 'no collapse'
interpretations of quantum mechanics (Studies in the History and Philosophy of
Modern Physics 27, 181-219 (1996)) can be proved without the 'weak
separability' assumption.
