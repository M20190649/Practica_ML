Quantum Brownian motion
We study the behavior of a subsystem (harmonic oscillator) in contact with a
thermal reservoir (finite set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators). We exactly
solve the eigenvalue problem and obtain the temporal evolution of the dynamical
variables of interest. We show how the subsystem goes to equilibrium and give
quantitative estimates of the Poincar\'e recurrence times. We study the
behavior of the subsystem mean ocuppation number in the limit of a dense bath
and compare it with the expected exponential decay law.
