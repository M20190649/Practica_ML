Control of open quantum systems dynamics
We investigate the control resources needed to effect arbitrary quantum
dynamics. We show that the ability to perform measurements on a quantum system,
combined with the ability to feed back the measurement results via coherent
control, allows one to control the system to follow any desired open-system
evolution. Such universal control can be achieved, in principle, through the
repeated application of only two coherent control operations and a simple
``Yes-No'' measurement.
