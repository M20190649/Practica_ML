Bifurcation Phenomenon in a Spin Relaxation
Spin relaxation in a strong-coupling regime (with respect to the spin system)
is investigated in detail based on the spin-boson model in a stochastic limit.
We find a bifurcation phenomenon in temperature dependence of relaxation
constants, which is never observed in the weak-coupling regime. We also discuss
inequalities among the relaxation constants in our model and show the
well-known relation 2\Gamma_T >= \Gamma_L, for example, for a wider parameter
region than before.
