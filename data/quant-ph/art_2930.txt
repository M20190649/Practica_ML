Robust quantum computation by simulation
Simulation of quantum systems that provide intrinsically fault-tolerant
quantum computation is shown to preserve fault tolerance. Errors committed in
the course of simulation are eliminated by the natural error-correcting
features of the systems simulated. Two examples are explored, toric codes and
non-abelian anyons. The latter is shown to provide universal robust quantum
computation via simulation.
