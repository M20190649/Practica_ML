Testing operational phase concepts in quantum optics
An experimental comparison of several operational phase concepts is
presented. In particular, it is shown that statistically motivated evaluation
of experimental data may lead to a significant improvement in phase fitting
upon the conventional Noh, Fouge'res and Mandel procedure. The analysis is
extended to the asymptotic limit of large intensities, where a strong evidence
in favor of multi--dimensional estimation procedures has been found.
