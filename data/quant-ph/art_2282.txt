Free motion time-of-arrival operator and probability distribution
We reappraise and clarify the contradictory statements found in the
literature concerning the time-of-arrival operator introduced by Aharonov and
Bohm in Phys. Rev. {\bf 122}, 1649 (1961). We use Naimark's dilation theorem to
reproduce the generalized decomposition of unity (or POVM) from any
self-adjoint extension of the operator, emphasizing a natural one, which arises
from the analogy with the momentum operator on the half-line. General time
operators are set within a unifying perspective. It is shown that they are not
in general related to the time of arrival, even though they may have the same
form.
