Experiment on Interaction-Free Measurement in Neutron Interferometry
A neutron interferometric test of interaction-free detection of the presence
of an absorbing object in one arm of a neutron interferometer has been
performed. Despite deviations from the ideal performance characteristics of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer it could be shown that information is obtained
without interaction.
