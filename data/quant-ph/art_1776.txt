Quantum phase space distributions in thermofield dynamics
It is shown that the the quantum phase space distributions corresponding to a
density operator $\rho$ can be expressed, in thermofield dynamics, as overlaps
between the state $\mid \rho >$ and "thermal" coherent states. The usefulness
of this approach is brought out in the context of a master equation describing
a nonlinear oscillator for which exact expressions for the quantum phase
distributions for an arbitrary initial condition are derived.
