Inequalities for dealing with detector inefficiencies in
  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type experiments
In this article we show that the three-particle GHZ theorem can be
reformulated in terms of inequalities, allowing imperfect correlations due to
detector inefficiencies. We show quantitatively that taking into accout those
inefficiencies, the published results of the Innsbruck experiment support the
nonexistence of local hidden variables that explain the experimental result.
