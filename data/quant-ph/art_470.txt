Generalized quantum measurements and local realism
The structure of a local hidden variable model for experiments involving
sequences of measurements rigorously is analyzed. Constraints imposed by local
realism on the conditional probabilities of the outcomes of such measurement
schemes are explicitly derived. The violation of local realism in the case of
``hidden nonlocality'' is illustrated by an operational example.
