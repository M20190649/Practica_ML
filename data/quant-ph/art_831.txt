Redefintions of Histories by Measurements - An Explanation of
  "Nonlocality" Observed in EPR-Bohm Experiments
It is proved in the frame of standard quantum mechanics that selection of
different ensembles emerging from measurements of an observable leads to
identification of corresponding reductions of the initial, premeasured state.
This solves the problem of ``nonlocality`` observed in EPR-Bohm-type
experiments.
