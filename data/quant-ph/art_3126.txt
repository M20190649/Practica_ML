Towards the elusive Efimov state of the ^4He_3 molecule through a new
  atom-optical state-selection technique
Excited states and excitation energies of weakly bound systems, e.g. atomic
few-body systems and clusters, are difficult to study experimentally. For this
purpose we propose a new and very general atom-optical method which is based on
inelastic diffraction from transmission gratings. The technique is applicable
to the recently found helium trimer molecule ^4He_3, allowing for the first
time an investigation of the possible existence of an excited trimer state and
determination of its excitation energy. This would be of fundamental importance
for the famous Efimov effect.
