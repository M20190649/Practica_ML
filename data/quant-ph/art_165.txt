Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory VI: The Classical Spin
In these continuation papers (VI and VII) we are interested in approach the
problem of spin from a classical point of view. In this first paper we will
show that the spin is neither basically relativistic nor quantum but reflects
just a simmetry property related to the Lie algebra to which it is associated.
The classical approach will be paraleled with the usual quantum one to stress
their formal similarities and epistemological differences. The important
problem of Einstein-Bose condensation for fermions will also be addressed.
