About optimal measurements in quantum hypothesizes testing
We consider the problem of a state determination for a two-level quantum
system which can be in one of two nonorthogonal mixed states. It is proved that
for the two independent identical systems the optimal combined measurement
(which considers the pair as one system) cannot be less optimal than the
corresponding sequential one (local measurements, accompanying by transfer of
classical information). The case of equality is achieved only when the mixed
states have the same eigenvalues or the same eigenvectors. Further, we consider
a case then the two systems are entangled: measurement of one system induces a
reduction of the another one's state. The conclusion about optimal character of
combined measurement takes place again, and conditions where the
above-mentioned methods coincide are derived.
