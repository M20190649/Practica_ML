From the quantum Zeno to the inverse quantum Zeno effect
The temporal evolution of an unstable quantum mechanical system undergoing
repeated measurements is investigated. In general, by changing the time
interval between successive measurements, the decay can be accelerated (inverse
quantum Zeno effect) or slowed down (quantum Zeno effect), depending on the
features of the interaction Hamiltonian. A geometric criterion is proposed for
a transition to occur between these two regimes.
