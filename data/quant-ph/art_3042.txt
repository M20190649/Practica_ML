Approach to the semiconductor cavity QED in high-Q regimes with
  q-deformed boson
The high density Frenkel exciton which interacts with a single mode
microcavity field is dealed with in the framework of the q-deformed boson. It
is shown that the q-defomation of bosonic commutation relations is satisfied
naturally by the exciton operators when the low density limit is deviated. An
analytical expression of the physical spectrum for the exciton is given by
using of the dressed states of the cavity field and the exciton. We also give
the numerical study and compare the theoretical results with the experimental
results
