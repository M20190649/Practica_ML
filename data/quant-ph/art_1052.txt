Time-Symmetrized Quantum Theory
A brief review of the time-symmetrized quantum formalism originated by
Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebowitz is presented. Symmetry of various measurements
under the time reversal is analyzed. Time-symmetrized counterfactuals are
introduced. It is argued that the time-symmetrized formalism demonstrates novel
profound features of quantum theory and that recent criticism of the formalism
is unfounded.
