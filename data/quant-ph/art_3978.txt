Experimental Test for Absence of R-Term in Schroedinger Equation in
  Curved Space
We point out that the presence of a term proportional to the scalar curvature
in the Schroedinger equation in curved space can easily be detected in atomic
spectra with Russel-Saunders coupling by a violation of the Lande interval rule
for adjacent levels E_J-E_{J-1} propto J.
