Indistinguishability and improper mixtures
All quantum mixtures are what d'Espagnat has termed "improper." His "proper"
mixture cannot be created -- if welcher weg, or distinguishing, information
exists, an improper mixture results, while in the absence of such information,
the resulting "mixture" is a pure state. D'Espagnat has claimed that an
interpretation of the improper mixture in terms of subensembles leads to
logical inconsistency; this claim is shown to be incorrect, as d'Espagnat's
argument fails to account for the indistinguishability of the pure-state
subensembles.
