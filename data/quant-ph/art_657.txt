Quantum Cryptography without Public Announcement of Bases
This paper provides a simple variation of the basic ideas of the BB84 quantum
cryptographic scheme leading to a method of key expansion. A secure random
sequence (the bases sequence) determines the encoding bases in a proposed
scheme. Using the bases sequence repeatedly is proven to be safe by quantum
mechanical laws.
