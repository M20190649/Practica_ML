Exponential Decay of Wavelength in a Dissipative System
Applying a technique developed in a recent work[1] to calculate wavefunction
evolution in a dissipative system with Ohmic friction, we show that the
wavelength of the wavefunction decays exponentially, while the Brownian motion
width gradually increases. In an interference experiment, when these two
parameters become equal, the Brownian motion erases the fringes, the system
thus approaches classical limit. We show that the wavelength decay is an
observable phenomenon.
