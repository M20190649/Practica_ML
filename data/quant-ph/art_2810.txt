First-order interference of nonclassical light emitted spontaneously at
  different times
We study first-order interference in spontaneous parametric down-conversion
generated by two pump pulses that do not overlap in time. The observed
modulation in the angular distribution of the signal detector counting rate can
only be explained in terms of a quantum mechanical description based on
biphoton states. The condition for observing interference in the signal channel
is shown to depend on the parameters of the idler radiation.
