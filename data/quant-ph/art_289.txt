Error Correction in Quantum Communication
We show how procedures which can correct phase and amplitude errors can be
directly applied to correct errors due to quantum entanglement. We specify
general criteria for quantum error correction, introduce quantum versions of
the Hamming and the Gilbert-Varshamov bounds and comment on the practical
implementation of quantum codes.
