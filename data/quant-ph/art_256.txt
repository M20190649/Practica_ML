Stochastic Schr√∂dinger equation from an interaction with the
  environment
We consider a class of models describing a quantum oscillator in interaction
with an environment. We show that models of continuous spontaneous localization
based on a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation can be derived as an approximation
to purely deterministic Hamiltonian systems. We show an exponential decay of
off-diagonal matrix elements in the energy representation.
