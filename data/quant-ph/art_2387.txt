Measuring a coherent superposition
We propose a simple method for measuring the populations and the relative
phase in a coherent superposition of two atomic states. The method is based on
coupling the two states to a third common (excited) state by means of two laser
pulses, and measuring the total fluorescence from the third state for several
choices of the excitation pulses.
