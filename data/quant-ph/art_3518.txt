Coherent states for the hydrogen atom
We construct a system of coherent states for the hydrogen atom that is
expressed in terms of elementary functions. Unlike to the previous attempts in
this direction, this system possesses the properties equivalent to the most of
those for the harmonic oscillator, with modifications due to the character of
the problem.
