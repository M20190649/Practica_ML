Parametric Self-Oscillation via Resonantly Enhanced Multiwave Mixing
We demonstrate an efficient nonlinear process in which Stokes and anti-Stokes
components are generated spontaneously in a Raman-like, near resonant media
driven by low power counter-propagating fields. Oscillation of this kind does
not require optical cavity and can be viewed as a spontaneous formation of
atomic coherence grating.
