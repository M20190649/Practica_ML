Low temperature dynamics and laser-cooling of two-species Coulomb chains
  for quantum logic
We study from the point of view of quantum logic the properties of the
collective oscillations of a linear chain of ions trapped in a linear Paul trap
and composed of two ion species. We discuss extensively sympathetic cooling of
the chain and the effect of anharmonicity on laser-cooling and
quantum-information processing.
