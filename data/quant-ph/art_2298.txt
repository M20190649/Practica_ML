Quantum Simulations on a Quantum Computer
We present a general scheme for performing a simulation of the dynamics of
one quantum system using another. This scheme is used to experimentally
simulate the dynamics of truncated quantum harmonic and anharmonic oscillators
using nuclear magnetic resonance. We believe this to be the first explicit
physical realization of such a simulation.
