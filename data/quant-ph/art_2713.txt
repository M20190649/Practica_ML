The supersymmetric modified Poschl-Teller and delta-well potentials
New supersymmetric partners of the modified Poschl-Teller and the Dirac's
delta well potentials are constructed in closed form. The resulting
one-parametric potentials are shown to be interrelated by a limiting process.
The range of values of the parameters for which these potentials are free of
singularities is exactly determined. The construction of higher order
supersymmetric partner potentials is also investigated.
