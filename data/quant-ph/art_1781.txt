An Inherently Quantum Computation Paradigm: NP-complete=P Under the
  Hypothetical Notion of Continuous Uncomplete von Neumann Measurement
The topical quantum computation paradigm is a transposition of the Turing
machine into the quantum framework. Implementations based on this paradigm have
limitations as to the number of: qubits, computation steps, efficient quantum
algorithms (found so far). A new exclusively quantum paradigm (with no
classical counterpart) is propounded, based on the speculative notion of
continuous uncomplete von Neumann measurement. Under such a notion, NP-complete
is equal to P. This can provide a mathematical framework for the search of
implementable paradigms, possibly exploiting particle statistics.
