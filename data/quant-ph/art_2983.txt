The Double Quantum Dot Feline Cousin of Schroedinger's Cat: An
  Experimental Testbed for a Discourse of Quantum Measurement Dichotomies
Intriguing dichotomies in quantum measurement theory involving the role of
the obersever, objective reality, collapse of wavefunctions and actualization
of a measurement outcome are cast into a patholigical gedanken experiment
involving a single electron in a double quantum dot system coupled via a weak
link.
