Entanglement of coherent states and decoherence
A possibility to produce entangled superpositions of strong coherent states
is discussed. A recent proposal by Howell and Yazell [Phys. Rev. A 62, 012102
(2000)] of a device which entangles two strong coherent coherent states is
critically examined. A serious flaw in their design is found. New modified
scheme is proposed and it is shown that it really can generate non-classical
states that can violate Bell inequality. Moreover, a profound analysis of the
effect of losses and decoherence on the degree of entanglement is accomplished.
It reveals the high sensitivity of the device to any disturbances and the
fragility of generated states.
