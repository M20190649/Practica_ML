Quantum copying: A network
We present a network consisting of quantum gates which produces two imperfect
copies of an arbitrary qubit. The quality of the copies does not depend on the
input qubit. We also show that for a restricted class of inputs it is possible
to use a very similar network to produce three copies instead of two. For
qubits in this class, the copy quality is again independent of the input and is
the same as the quality of the copies produced by the two-copy network.
