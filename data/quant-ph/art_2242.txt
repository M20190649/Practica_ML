Generation and Measurement of Nonclassical States by Quantum Fock Filter
We study a novel optical setup which is able to select a specific Fock
component from a generic input state. The device allows to synthesize number
states and superpositions of few number states, and to measure the photon
distribution and the density matrix of a generic input signal.
