When only two thirds of the entanglement can be distilled
We provide an example of distillable bipartite mixed state such that, even in
the asymptotic limit, more pure-state entanglement is required to create it
than can be distilled from it. Thus, we show that the irreversibility in the
processes of formation and distillation of bipartite states, recently proved in
[G. Vidal, J.I. Cirac, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, (2001) 5803-5806], is not limited
to bound-entangled states.
