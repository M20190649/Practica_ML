Exact two-loop vacuum polarization correctionto the Lamb shift in
  hydrogen-like ions
We present a calculation scheme for the two-loop vacuum polarization
correction of order $\alpha^2$ to the Lamb shift of hydrogen-like high-Z atoms.
The interaction with the external Coulomb field is taken into account to all
orders in $(Z\alpha)$. By means of a modified potential approach the problem is
reduced to the evaluation of effective one-loop vacuum polarization potentials.
An expression for the energy shift is deduced within the framework of partial
wave decomposition performing appropriate subtractions. Exact results for the
two-loop vacuum polarization contribution to the Lamb shift of K- and L-shell
electron states in hydrogen-like Lead and Uranium are presented.
