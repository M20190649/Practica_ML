Basic limitations for entanglement catalysis
In this paper we summarize the necessary condition for incomparable states
which can be catalyzed under entanglement-assisted LQCC (ELQCC). When we apply
an extended condition for entanglement transformation to entanglement-assisted
local manipulation we obtain a fundamental limit for entanglement catalysts.
Some relative questions are also discussed.
