Dark pair coherent states of the motion of a trapped ion
We propose a scheme for generating vibrational pair coherent states of the
motion of an ion in a two-dimensional trap. In our scheme, the trapped ion is
excited bichromatically by three laser beams along different directions in the
X-Y plane of the ion trap. We show that if the initial vibrational state is
given by a two-mode Fock state, the final steady state, indicated by the
extinction of the fluorescence emitted by the ion, is a pure state. The
motional state of the ion in the equilibrium realizes that of the
highly-correlated pair coherent state.
