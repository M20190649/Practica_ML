How to Probe for Dynamical Structure in the Collapse of Entangled States
  Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
The spin state of two magnetically inequivalent protons in contiguous atoms
of a molecule becomes entangeled by the indirect spin-spin interaction
(j-coupling). The degree of entanglement oscillates at the beat frequency
resulting from the splitting of a degeneracy. This beating is manifest in NMR
spectroscopy as an envelope of the transverse magnetization and should be
visible in the free induction decay signal. The period (approximately 1 sec) is
long enough for interference between the linear dynamics and collapse of the
wave-function induced by a Stern-Gerlach inhomogeneity to significantly alter
the shape of that envelope. Various dynamical collapse theories can be
distinguished by their observably different predictions with respect to this
alteration. Adverse effects of detuning due to the Stern-Gerlach inhomogeneity
can be reduced to an acceptable level by having a sufficiently thin sample or a
strong rf field.
