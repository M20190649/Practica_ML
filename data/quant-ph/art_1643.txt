A Modification of Grover's Algorithm as a Fast Database Search
A modification of Grover's algorithm is proposed, which can be used directly
as a fast database search. An explicit two q-bit example is displayed in
detail. We discuss the case where the database has multiple entries
corresponding to the same target value.
