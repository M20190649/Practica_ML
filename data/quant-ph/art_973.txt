Quantum Measurement Back-Reaction and Induced Toplogical Phases
It is shown that a topological vector-potential (Berry phase) is induced by
the act of measuring angular momentum in a direction defined by a reference
particle. This vector potential appears as a consequence of the back-reaction
due to the quantum measurement.
