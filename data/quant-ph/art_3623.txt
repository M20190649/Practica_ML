Single photon generation by pulsed excitation of a single dipole
The fluorescence of a single dipole excited by an intense light pulse can
lead to the generation of another light pulse containing a single photon. The
influence of the duration and energy of the excitation pulse on the number of
photons in the fluorescence pulse is studied. The case of a two-level dipole
with strongly damped coherences is considered. The presence of a metastable
state leading to shelving is also investigated.
