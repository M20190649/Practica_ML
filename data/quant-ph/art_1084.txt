A Model for the Production of Regular Fluorescent Light from Coherently
  Driven Atoms
It has been shown in recent years that incoherent pumping through multiple
atomic levels provides a mechanism for the production of highly anti-bunched
light, and that as the number of incoherent steps is increased the light
becomes increasingly regular. We show that in a resonance fluorescence
situation, a multi-level atom may be multiply coherently driven so that the
fluorescent light is highly anti-bunched. We show that as the number of
coherently driven levels is increased, the spontaneous emissions may be made
increasingly more regular. We present a systematic method for designing the
level structure and driving required to produce highly anti-bunched light in
this manner for an arbitrary even number of levels.
