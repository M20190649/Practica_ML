Numerical simulations of fundamental processes in cavity QED: Atomic
  decay
We present results of numerical investigation of a microscopic dynamics of a
two-level atom embedded into a ``linear crystal'' of other two-level atoms.
These additional atoms play a role of a material media. All atoms interact with
a multimode cavity field. We study how the decay of the initially excited atom
is affected by the presence of material media and spectral properties of the
cavity field.
