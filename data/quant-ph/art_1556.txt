Nonlocality of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen State in Wigner Representation
We demonstrate that the Wigner function of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state,
though positive definite, provides a direct evidence of the nonlocal character
of this state. The proof is based on an observation that the Wigner function
describes correlations in the joint measurement of the phase space displaced
parity operator.
