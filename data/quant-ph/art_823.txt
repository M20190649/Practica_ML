Collision states and scar effects in charged three-body problems
Semiclassical methods form a bridge between classical systems and their
quantum counterparts. An interesting phenomenon discovered in this connection
is the scar effect, whereby energy eigenstates display enhancement structures
resembling the path of unstable periodic orbits. This paper deals with
collision states in charged three-body problems, in periodic media, which are
scarred by unstable classical orbits. The scar effect has a potential for
practical applications because orbits corresponding to zero measure classical
configurations may be reached and stabilized by resonant excitation. It may be
used, for example, to induce reactions that are favoured by unstable
configurations.
