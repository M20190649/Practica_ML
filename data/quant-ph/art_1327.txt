Cooling the Collective Motion of Trapped Ions to Initialize a Quantum
  Register
We report preparation in the ground state of collective modes of motion of
two trapped 9Be+ ions. This is a crucial step towards realizing quantum logic
gates which can entangle the ions' internal electronic states. We find that
heating of the modes of relative ion motion is substantially suppressed
relative to that of the center-of-mass modes, suggesting the importance of
these modes in future experiments.
