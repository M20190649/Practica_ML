Some Consequences of the Law of Local Energy Conservation in
  Electromagnetic field
At electromagnetic interactions of particles there arises defect of masses,
i.e. the energy is liberated since the particles of the different charges are
attracted. It is shown that this change of the effective mass of a particle in
the external electrical field (of a nucleus) results in displacement of atomic
levels of electrons. The expressions describing these velocity changes and
displacement of energy levels of electrons in the atom are obtained.
