Quantum tomography of mesoscopic superpositions of radiation states
We show the feasibility of a tomographic reconstruction of Schr\"{o}dinger
cat states generated according to the scheme proposed by S. Song, C.M. Caves
and B. Yurke [Phys. Rev. A 41, 5261 (1990)]. We present a technique that
tolerates realistic values for quantum efficiency at photodetectors. The
measurement can be achieved by a standard experimental setup.
