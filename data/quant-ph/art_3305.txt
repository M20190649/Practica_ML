The finite difference algorithm for higher order supersymmetry
The higher order supersymmetric partners of the Schroedinger's Hamiltonians
can be explicitly constructed by iterating a simple finite difference equation
corresponding to the Baecklund transformation. The method can completely
replace the Crum determinants. Its limiting, differential case offers some new
operational advantages.
