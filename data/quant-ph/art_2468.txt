Classical information and distillable entanglement
We establish a quantitative connection between the amount of lost classical
information about a quantum state and the concomitant loss of entanglement.
Using methods that have been developed for the optimal purification of mixed
states we find a class of mixed states with known distillable entanglement.
These results can be used to determine the quantum capacity of a quantum
channel which randomizes the order of transmitted signals.
