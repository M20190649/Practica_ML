Transitions in quantum networks
We consider transitions in quantum networks analogous to those in the
two-dimensional Ising model. We show that for a network of active components
the transition is between the quantum and the classical behaviour of the
network, and the critical amplification coincides with the fundamental quantum
cloning limit.
