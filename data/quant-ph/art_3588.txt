Negative phase time for Scattering at Quantum Wells: A Microwave Analogy
  Experiment
If a quantum mechanical particle is scattered by a potential well, the wave
function of the particle can propagate with negative phase time. Due to the
analogy of the Schr\"odinger and the Helmholtz equation this phenomenon is
expected to be observable for electromagnetic wave propagation. Experimental
data of electromagnetic wells realized by wave guides filled with different
dielectrics confirm this conjecture now.
