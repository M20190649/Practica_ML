Classical trajectories compatible with quantum mechanics
Consider any stationary Schroedinger wave equation (SWE) solution $psi (x)$
for a particle. The corresponding PDF on position QTR{em}{x} of the particle is
QTR{em}{p}$_{X}(x)=|psi (x)|^{2}$. There is a classical trajectory
QTR{em}{x(t)} for the particle that is consistent with this PDF. The trajectory
is unique to within an additive constant corresponding to an initial condition
QTR{em}{x(0).} However the value of QTR{em}{x(0)} cannot be known. As an
example, a free particle in its ground state in a box of length QTR{em}{L}
obeys a classical trajectory QTR{em}{x/L - (1/2}$pi)sin (2pi x/L)+t_{0}=t.$ The
constant QTR{em}{t}$_{0}$ is an unknowable time displacement. Momentum values,
however, cannot be determined by merely differentiating QTR{em}{d/dt} the
trajectory QTR{em}{x(t)} and, instead, follow the usual quantification rules of
Heisenberg's. This permits position and momentum to remain complementary
variables. Our approach is fundamentally different from that of D. Bohm.
