Bohmian description of a decaying quantum system
We present a Bohmian description of a decaying quantum system. A particle is
initially confined in a region around the origin which is surrounded by a
repulsive potential barrier. The particle leaks out in time tunneling through
the barrier. We determine Bohm trajectories with which we can visualize various
features of the decaying system.
