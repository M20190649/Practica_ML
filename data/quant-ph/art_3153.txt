Integrity bases for local invariants of composite quantum systems
Unitary group branchings appropriate to the calculation of local invariants
of density matrices of composite quantum systems are formulated using the
method of $S$-function plethysms. From this, the generating function for the
number of invariants at each degree in the density matrix can be computed. For
the case of two two-level systems the generating function is $F(q) = 1 + q +
4q^{2} + 6 q^{3} + 16 q^{4} + 23 q^{5} + 52 q^{6} + 77 q^{7} + 150 q^{8} + 224
q^{9} + 396 q^{10} + 583 q^{11}+ O(q^{12})$. Factorisation of such series leads
in principle to the identification of an integrity basis of algebraically
independent invariants. This note replaces Appendix B of our paper\cite{us} J
