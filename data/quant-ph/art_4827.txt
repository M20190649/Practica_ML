Exponential lower bound on the highest fidelity achievable by quantum
  error-correcting codes
On a class of memoryless quantum channels which includes the depolarizing
channel, the highest fidelity of quantum error-correcting codes of length n and
rate R is proven to be lower bounded by 1-exp[-nE(R)+o(n)] for some function
E(R). The E(R) is positive below some threshold R', which implies R' is a lower
bound on the quantum capacity.
