Quantum measurements and the Abelian Stabilizer Problem
We present a polynomial quantum algorithm for the Abelian stabilizer problem
which includes both factoring and the discrete logarithm. Thus we extend famous
Shor's results. Our method is based on a procedure for measuring an eigenvalue
of a unitary operator. Another application of this procedure is a polynomial
quantum Fourier transform algorithm for an arbitrary finite Abelian group. The
paper also contains a rather detailed introduction to the theory of quantum
computation.
