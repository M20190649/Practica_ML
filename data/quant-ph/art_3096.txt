Three-Qubit Gate Realization Using Single Quantum Particle
Using virtual spin formalism it is shown that a quantum particle with eight
energy levels can store three qubits. The formalism allows to realize a
universal set of quantum gates. Feasible formalism implementation is suggested
which uses nuclear spin-7/2 as a storage medium and radio frequency pulses as
the gates. One pulse realization of all universal gates has been found,
including three-qubit Toffoli gate.
