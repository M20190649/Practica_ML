Decoherence, chaos, quantum-classical correspondence, and the
  algorithmic arrow of time
The environment -- external or internal degrees of freedom coupled to the
system -- can, in effect, monitor some of its observables. As a result, the
eigenstates of these observables decohere and behave like classical states:
Continuous destruction of superpositions leads to environment-induced
superselection (einselection). Here I investigate it in the context of quantum
chaos (i. e., quantum dynamics of systems which are classically chaotic).
