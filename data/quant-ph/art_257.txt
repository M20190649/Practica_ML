Considerations on Localization of Macroscopic Bodies
Position holds a very special role in understanding the classical behaviour
of macroscopic bodies on the basis of quantum principles. This lead us to
examine the localised states of a large condensed object in the context of a
realistic model. Following the argument that an isolated macroscopic body is
usually described by a linear superposition of low-lying energy eigenstates, it
has been found that localised states of this type correspond to a nearly
minimum-uncertainty state for the center of mass. An indication is also given
of the dependence of the center of mass position spread on the number of
constituent particles.
  This paper is not offered as an answer to the intriguing question of the
preferred role played by the position basis, but will hopefully provide some
contribution to the quantum modelling of multi-particle systems.
