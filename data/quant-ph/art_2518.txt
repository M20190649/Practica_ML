Experimental Verifications of the Casimir Attractive Force between Solid
  Bodies
A brief review of the recent experimental verifications of the Casimir force
between extended bodies is presented. With modern techniques, it now appears
feasible to test the force law with 1% precision; I will address the issues
relating to the interpretation of experiments at this level of accuracy
