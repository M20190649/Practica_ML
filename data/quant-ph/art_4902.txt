Are Quantum Computing Models Realistic?
The commonly used circuit model of quantum computing leaves out the problems
of imprecision in the initial state preparation, particle statistics
(indistinguishability of particles belonging to the same quantum state), and
error correction (current techniques cannot correct all small errors). The
initial state in the circuit model computation is obtained by applying
potentially imprecise Hadamard gate operations whereas useful quantum
computation requires a state with no uncertainty. We review some limitations of
the circuit model and speculate on the question if a hierarchy of quantum-type
computing models exists.
