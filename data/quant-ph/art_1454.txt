Localization of Events in Space-Time
The present paper deals with the quantum coordinates of an event in
space-time, individuated by a quantum object. It is known that these
observables cannot be described by self-adjoint operators or by the
corresponding spectral projection-valued measure. We describe them by means of
a positive-operator-valued (POV) measure in the Minkowski space-time,
satisfying a suitable covariance condition with respect to the Poincare' group.
This POV measure determines the probability that a measurement of the
coordinates of the event gives results belonging to a given set in space-time.
We show that this measure must vanish on the vacuum and the one-particle
states, which cannot define any event. We give a general expression for the
Poincare' covariant POV measures. We define the baricentric events, which lie
on the world-line of the centre-of-mass, and we find a simple expression for
the average values of their coordinates. Finally, we discuss the conditions
which permit the determination of the coordinates with an arbitrary accuracy.
