Time of arrival in the presence of interactions
We introduce a formalism for the calculation of the time of arrival t at a
space point for particles traveling through interacting media. We develop a
general formulation that employs quantum canonical transformations from the
free to the interacting cases to construct t in the context of the Positive
Operator Valued Measures. We then compute the probability distribution in the
times of arrival at a point for particles that have undergone reflection,
transmission or tunneling off finite potential barriers. For narrow Gaussian
initial wave packets we obtain multimodal time distributions of the reflected
packets and a combination of the Hartman effect with unexpected retardation in
tunneling. We also employ explicitly our formalism to deal with arrivals in the
interaction region for the step and linear potentials.
