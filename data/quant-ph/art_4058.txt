On the Incompatibility of Standard Quantum Mechanics and the de
  Broglie-Bohm Theory
It is shown that the de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory of multi-particle systems
is incompatible with the standard quantum theory of such systems unless the
former is ergodic. A realistic experiment is suggested to distinguish between
the two theories.
