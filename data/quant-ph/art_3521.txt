Preferred Frame versus Multisimultaneity: meaning and relevance of a
  forthcoming experiment
It is argued that: 1) Quantum Mechanics implies the preferred frame also
because of the collapse delayed at detection, 2) forthcoming experiments with
moving beam-splitters will allow us to decide between Preferred Frame and
Multisimultaneity, and 3) if the Preferred Frame prevails, superluminal
communication is in principle possible.
