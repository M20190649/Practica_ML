Quantum Consciousness
In a previous paper, the author proposed a quantum mechanical interaction
that would insure that the evolution of subjective states would parallel the
evolution of biological states, as required by von Neumann's theory of
measurement. The particular model for this interaction suggested an experiment
that the author has now performed wih negative results. A modified model is
outlined in this paper that preserves the desirable features of the original
model, and is consistent with the experimental results. This model will be more
difficult to verify. However, some strategies are suggested.
