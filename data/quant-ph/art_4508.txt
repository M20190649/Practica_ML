An optical conveyor belt for single neutral atoms
Using optical dipole forces we have realized controlled transport of a single
or any desired small number of neutral atoms over a distance of a centimeter
with sub-micrometer precision. A standing wave dipole trap is loaded with a
prescribed number of cesium atoms from a magneto-optical trap. Mutual detuning
of the counter-propagating laser beams moves the interference pattern, allowing
us to accelerate and stop the atoms at preselected points along the standing
wave. The transportation efficiency is close to 100%. This optical "single-atom
conveyor belt" represents a versatile tool for future experiments requiring
deterministic delivery of a prescribed number of atoms on demand.
