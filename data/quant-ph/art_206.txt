Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics
In order to arrive at Bohmian mechanics from standard nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics one need do almost nothing! One need only complete the usual quantum
description in what is really the most obvious way: by simply including the
positions of the particles of a quantum system as part of the state description
of that system, allowing these positions to evolve in the most natural way. The
entire quantum formalism, including the uncertainty principle and quantum
randomness, emerges from an analysis of this evolution. This can be expressed
succinctly---though in fact not succinctly enough---by declaring that the
essential innovation of Bohmian mechanics is the insight that {\it particles
move }!
