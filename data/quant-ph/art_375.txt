Fault-Tolerant Error Correction with Efficient Quantum Codes
We exhibit a simple, systematic procedure for detecting and correcting errors
using any of the recently reported quantum error-correcting codes. The
procedure is shown explicitly for a code in which one qubit is mapped into
five. The quantum networks obtained are fault tolerant, that is, they can
function successfully even if errors occur during the error correction. Our
construction is derived using a recently introduced group-theoretic framework
for unifying all known quantum codes.
