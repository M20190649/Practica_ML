A space for the quantum world
Epistemic interpretations of quantum mechanics fail to address the puzzle
posed by the occurrence of probabilities in a fundamental physical theory. This
is a puzzle about the physical world, not a puzzle about our relation to the
physical world. Its solution requires a new concept of physical space,
presented in this article. An examination of how the mind and the brain
construct the phenomenal world reveals the psychological and neurobiological
reasons why we think about space in ways that are inadequate to the physical
world. The resulting notion that space is an intrinsically partitioned expanse
has up to now stood in the way of a consistent ontological interpretation.
