Quantum signatures of chaos in the dynamics of a trapped ion
We show how a nonlinear chaotic system, the parametrically kicked nonlinear
oscillator, may be realised in the dynamics of a trapped, laser-cooled ion,
interacting with a sequence of standing wave pulses. Unlike the original
optical scheme [G.J.Milburn and C.A.Holmes, Phys. Rev A, 44, p4704, (1991)],
the trapped ion enables strongly quantum dynamics with minimal dissipation.
This should permit an experimental test of one of the quantum signatures of
chaos; irregular collapse and revival dynamics of the average vibrational
energy.
