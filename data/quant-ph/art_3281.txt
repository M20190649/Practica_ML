Towards Nonadditive Quantum Information Theory
A definition of the nonadditive (nonextensive) conditional entropy indexed by
q is presented. Based on the composition law in terms of it, the
Shannon-Khinchin axioms are generalized and the uniqueness theorem is
established for the Tsallis entropy. The nonadditive conditional entropy, when
considered in the quantum context, is always positive for separable states but
takes negative values for entangled states, indicating its utility for
characterizing entanglement. A criterion deduced from it for separability of
the density matrix is examined in detail by using a bipartite spin-half system.
It is found that the strongest criterion for separability obtained by Peres
using an algebraic method is recovered in the present information-theoretic
approach.
