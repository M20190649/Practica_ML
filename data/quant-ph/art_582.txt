Properties of Squeezed-State Excitations
The photon distribution function of a discrete series of excitations of
squeezed coherent states is given explicitly in terms of Hermite polynomials of
two variables. The Wigner and the coherent-state quasiprobabilities are also
presented in closed form through the Hermite polynomials and their limiting
cases. Expectation values of photon numbers and their dispersion are
calculated. Some three-dimensional plots of photon distributions for different
squeezing parameters demonstrating oscillatory behaviour are given.
