Clauser-Horne inequality for qutrits
In this brief report we show the new Bell-Clauser-Horne inequality for two
entangled three dimensional quantum systems (so called qutrits). This
inequality is violated by a maximally entangled state of two qutrits observed
via symmetric three input and three output port beamsplitter only if the amount
of noise in the system equals ${11-6\sqrt3 \over 2}\approx 0.308$. This is in
perfect agreement with the previous numerical calculations presented in
Kaszlikowski {\it et. al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 4418 (2000).
