Purification of impure density operators and the recovery of
  entanglements
The need to retain the relative phases in quantum mechanics implies an
addition law parametrized by a phase of two density operators required for the
purification of a density matrix. This is shown with quantum tomography and the
Wigner function. Entanglement is determined in terms of phase dependent
multiplication.
