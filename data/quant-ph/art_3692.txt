Manipulation of Cold Atomic Collisions by Cavity QED Effects
We show how the dynamics of collisions between cold atoms can be manipulated
by a modification of spontaneous emission times. This is achieved by placing
the atomic sample in a resonant optical cavity. Spontaneous emission is
enhanced by a combination of multiparticle entanglement together with a higher
density of modes of the modified vacuum field, in a situation akin to
superradiance. A specific situation is considered and we show that this effect
can be experimentally observed as a large suppression in trap-loss rates.
