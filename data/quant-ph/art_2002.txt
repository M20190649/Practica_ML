Average local values and local variances in quantum mechanics
Several definitions for the average local value and local variance of a
quantum observable are examined and compared with their classical counterparts.
An explicit way to construct an infinite number of these quantities is
provided. It is found that different classical conditions may be satisfied by
different definitions, but none of the quantum definitions examined is entirely
consistent with all classical requirements.
