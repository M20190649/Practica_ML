PPLN Waveguide for Quantum Communication
We report on energy-time and time-bin entangled photon-pair sources based on
a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Degenerate twin photons
at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and
coupled into standard telecom fibers. Our PPLN waveguide features a very high
conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6), roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than
that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes,
this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an
important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a
simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed
pump. To investigate the quality of the entangled states, we perform
photon-pair interference experiments, leading to visibilities of 97% for the
case of energy-time entanglement and of 84% for the case of time-bin
entanglement. Although the last figure must still be improved, these tests
demonstrate the high potential of PPLN waveguide based sources to become a key
element for future quantum communication schemes
