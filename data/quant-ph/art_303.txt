Correlation properties of quantum measurements
The kind of information provided by a measurement is determined in terms of
the correlation established between observables of the apparatus and the
measured system. Using the framework of quantum measurement theory, necessary
and sufficient conditions for a measurement interaction to produce strong
correlations are given and are found to be related to properties of the final
object and apparatus states. These general results are illustrated with
reference to the standard model of the quantum theory of measurement.
