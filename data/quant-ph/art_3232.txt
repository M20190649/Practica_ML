Line narrowing via cavity-induced quantum interference in a $Îž$-type
  atom
We show that cavity-induced interference may result in spectral line
narrowing in the absorption spectrum of a $\Xi$-type atom coupled to a
single-mode, frequency-tunable cavity field with a pre-selected polarization at
finite temperature.
