Experimental Realization of an Order-Finding Algorithm with an NMR
  Quantum Computer
We report the realization of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
computer which combines the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) with exponentiated
permutations, demonstrating a quantum algorithm for order-finding. This
algorithm has the same structure as Shor's algorithm and its speed-up over
classical algorithms scales exponentially. The implementation uses a
particularly well-suited five quantum bit molecule and was made possible by a
new state initialization procedure and several quantum control techniques.
