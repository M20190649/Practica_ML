Violations of Bell Inequalities for Measurements with Macroscopic
  Uncertainties: What does it Mean to Violate Macroscopic Local Realism?
We suggest to test the premise of ``macroscopic local realism'' which is
sufficient to derive Bell inequalities when measurements of photon number are
only accurate to an uncertainty of order $n$ photons, where $n$ is macroscopic.
Macroscopic local realism is only sufficient to imply, in the context of the
original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument, fuzzy ``elements of reality'' which
have a macroscopic indeterminacy. We show therefore how the violation of local
realism in the presence of macroscopic uncertainties implies the failure of
``macroscopic local realism''. Quantum states violating this macroscopic local
realism are presented.
