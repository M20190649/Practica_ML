Optimal Copying of One Quantum Bit
A quantum copying machine producing two (in general non-identical) copies of
an arbitrary input state of a two-dimensional Hilbert space (qubit) is studied
using a quality measure based on distinguishability of states, rather than
fidelity. The problem of producing optimal copies is investigated with the help
of a Bloch sphere representation, and shown to have a well-defined solution,
including cases in which the two copies have unequal quality, or the quality
depends upon the input state (is ``anisotropic'' in Bloch sphere language), or
both. A simple quantum circuit yields the optimal copying machine. With a
suitable choice of parameters it becomes an optimal eavesdropping machine for
some versions of quantum cryptography, or reproduces the Buzek and Hillery
result for isotropic copies.
