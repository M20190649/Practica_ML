Scattering Theory from a Bohmian Perspective
Quantum mechanical scattering theory is a subject with a long and winding
history. We shall pick out some of the most important concepts and ideas of
scattering theory and look at them from the perspective of Bohmian mechanics:
Bohmian mechanics, having real particle trajectories, provides an excellent
basis for analyzing scattering phenomena.
