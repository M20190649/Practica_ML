A Theory of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation
In order to use quantum error-correcting codes to actually improve the
performance of a quantum computer, it is necessary to be able to perform
operations fault-tolerantly on encoded states. I present a general theory of
fault-tolerant operations based on symmetries of the code stabilizer. This
allows a straightforward determination of which operations can be performed
fault-tolerantly on a given code. I demonstrate that fault-tolerant universal
computation is possible for any stabilizer code. I discuss a number of examples
in more detail, including the five-qubit code.
