Photon adding and subtracting and Schroedinger-cat generation in
  conditional output measurement on a beam splitter
The problem of photon adding and subtracting is studied, using conditional
output measurement on a beam splitter. It is shown that for various classes of
states the corresponding photon-added and -subtracted states can be prepared.
Analytical results are presented, with special emphasis on photon-added and
-subtracted squeezed vacuum states, which are found to represent two different
types of Schroedinger-cat-like states. Effects of realistic photocounting and
Fock-state preparation are discussed.
