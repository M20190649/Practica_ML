Pauli Exchange and Quantum Error Correction
In many physically realistic models of quantum computation, Pauli exchange
interactions cause a special type of two-qubit errors, called exchange errors,
to occur as a first order effect of couplings within the computer. We discuss
the physical mechanisms behind exchange errors and codes designed to explicitly
deal with them.
