Experimental Implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm for
  Three-Qubit Functions using Pure Coherent Molecular Superpositions
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is experimentally demonstrated for three-qubit
functions using pure coherent superpositions of Li$_{2}$ rovibrational
eigenstates. The function's character, either constant or balanced, is
evaluated by first imprinting the function, using a phase-shaped femtosecond
pulse, on a coherent superposition of the molecular states, and then projecting
the superposition onto an ionic final state, using a second femtosecond pulse
at a specific time delay.
