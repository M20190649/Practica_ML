Polarization Structure of Quantum Light Fields: A New Insight. 2:
  Generalized Coherent States, Squeezing and Geometric Phases
Within the new description of the polarization structure of quantum light
(given in Part I) some types of generalized coherent states related to the
polarization SU(2) group are examined. With their help we give a quasiclassical
description of polarization properties of light fields and discuss the concept
of squeezing and uncertainty relations for multimode light in the polarization
quantum optics. As a consequence, a new classification of polarization states
of quantum light is obtained. We also derive geometric phases acquired by
different quantum light beams transmitted through "polarization rotators".
