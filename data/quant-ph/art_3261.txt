Fidelity balance in quantum operations
I derive a tight bound between the quality of estimating the state of a
single copy of a $d$-level system, and the degree the initial state has to be
altered in course of this procedure. This result provides a complete analytical
description of the quantum mechanical trade-off between the information gain
and the quantum state disturbance expressed in terms of mean fidelities. I also
discuss consequences of this bound for quantum teleportation using nonmaximally
entangled states.
