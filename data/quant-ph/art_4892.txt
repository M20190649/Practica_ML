NMR Quantum Information Processing and Entanglement
In this essay we discuss the issue of quantum information and recent nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. We explain why these experiments should
be regarded as quantum information processing (QIP) despite the fact that, in
present liquid state NMR experiments, no entanglement is found. We comment on
how these experiments contribute to the future of QIP and include a brief
discussion on the origin of the power of quantum computers.
