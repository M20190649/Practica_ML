Multipartite bound entangled states that violate Bell's inequality
We study the relation between distillability of multipartite states and
violation of Bell's inequality. We prove that there exist multipartite bound
entangled states (i.e. non-separable, non-distillable states) that violate a
multipartite Bell inequality. This implies that (i) violation of Bell's
inequality is not a sufficient condition for distillability and (ii) some bound
entangled states cannot be described by a local hidden variable model.
