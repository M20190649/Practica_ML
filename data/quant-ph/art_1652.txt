Generation of arbitrary quantum states of traveling fields
We show that any single-mode quantum state can be generated from the vacuum
by alternate application of the coherent displacement operator and the creation
operator. We propose an experimental implementation of the scheme for traveling
optical fields, which is based on field mixings and conditional measurements in
a beam splitter array, and calculate the probability of state generation.
