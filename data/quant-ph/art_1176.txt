Quantum Mechanics is Either Non-Linear Or Non-Introspective
The measurement conundrum seems to have plagued quantum mechanics for so long
that impressions of an inconsistency amongst its axioms have spawned.
  A demonstration that such purported inconsistency is fictitious may then be
in order and is presented here.
  An exclusion principle of sorts emerges, stating that quantum mechanics
cannot be simultaneously linear and introspective (self-observing).
