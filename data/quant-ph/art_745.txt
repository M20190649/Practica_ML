Bures distance between two displaced thermal states
The Bures distance between two displaced thermal states and the corresponding
geometric quantities (statistical metric, volume element, scalar curvature) are
computed. Under nonunitary (dissipative) dynamics, the statistical distance
shows the same general features previously reported in the literature by
Braunstein and Milburn for two--state systems. The scalar curvature turns out
to have new interesting properties when compared to the curvature associated
with squeezed thermal states.
