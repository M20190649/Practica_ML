From quantum trajectories to classical orbits
Recently it has been shown that the evolution of open quantum systems may be
``unraveled'' into individual ``trajectories,'' providing powerful numerical
and conceptual tools. In this letter we use quantum trajectories to study
mesoscopic systems and their classical limit. We show that in this limit,
Quantum Jump (QJ) trajectories approach a diffusive limit very similar to the
Quantum State Diffusion (QSD) unraveling. The latter follows classical
trajectories in the classical limit. Hence, both unravelings show the rise of
classical orbits. This is true for both regular and chaotic systems (which
exhibit strange attractors).
