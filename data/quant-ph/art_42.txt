Interpretation of the evolution parameter of the Feynman parametrization
  of the Dirac equation
The Feynman parametrization of the Dirac equation is considered in order to
obtain an indefinite mass formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. It is
shown that the parameter that labels the evolution is related to the proper
time. The Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles naturally arises from
the formalism.
