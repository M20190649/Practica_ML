New hydrogen-like potentials
Using the modified factorization method introduced by Mielnik, we construct a
new class of radial potentials whose spectrum for l=0 coincides exactly with
that of the hydrogen atom. A limiting case of our family coincides with the
potentials previously derived by Abraham and Moses
