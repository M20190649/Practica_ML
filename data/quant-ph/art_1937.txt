Determining Acceptance Possibility for a Quantum Computation is Hard for
  the Polynomial Hierarchy
It is shown that determining whether a quantum computation has a non-zero
probability of accepting is at least as hard as the polynomial time hierarchy.
This hardness result also applies to determining in general whether a given
quantum basis state appears with nonzero amplitude in a superposition, or
whether a given quantum bit has positive expectation value at the end of a
quantum computation. This result is achieved by showing that the complexity
class NQP of Adleman, Demarrais, and Huang, a quantum analog of NP, is equal to
the counting class coC$_=$P.
