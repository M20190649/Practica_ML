Exponential and Laguerre Squeezed States for su(1,1) Algebra and
  Calogero-Sutherland Model
A class of squeezed states for the su(1,1) algebra is found and expressed by
the exponential and Laguerre-polynomial operators acting on the vacuum states.
As a special case it is proved that the Perelomov's coherent state is a
ladder-operator squeezed state and therefore a minimum uncertainty state. The
theory is applied to the two-particle Calogero-Sutherland model. We find some
new squeezed states and compared them with the classical trajectories. The
connection with some su(1,1) quantum optical systems (amplitude-squared
realization, Holstein-Primakoff realization, the two mode realization and a
four mode realization) is also discussed.
