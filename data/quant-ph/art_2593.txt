Inseparability criterion for continuous variable systems
An inseparability criterion based on the total variance of a pair of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type operators is proposed for continuous variable
systems. The criterion provides a sufficient condition for entanglement of any
two-party continuous variable states. Furthermore, for all the Gaussian states,
this criterion turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for
inseparability.
