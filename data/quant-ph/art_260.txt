An Evolutionary Picture for Quantum Physics
In the orthodox language of Quantum Mechanics the observer occupies a central
position and the only "real events" are the measuring results. We argue here
that this narrow view is not forced upon us by the lessons of Quantum Physics.
An alternative language, closer to the intuitive picture of the working
physicist in many areas, is not only possible but warranted. It needs, however,
a different conceptual picture ultimately implying also a different
mathematical structure. Only a rudimentary outline of this picture will be
attempted here. The importance of idealizations, unavoidable in any scheme, is
emphasized. A brief discussion of the EPR-phenomenon is added.
