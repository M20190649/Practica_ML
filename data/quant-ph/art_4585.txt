Double entanglement and quantum cryptography
We propose a quantum transmission based on bi-photons which are
doubly-entangled both in polarisation and phase. This scheme finds a natural
application in quantum cryptography, where we show that an eventual
eavesdropper is bound to introduce a larger error on the quantum communication
than for a single entangled bi-photon communication, when steeling the same
information.
