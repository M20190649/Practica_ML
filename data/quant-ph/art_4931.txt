Realization of generalized quantum searching using nuclear magnetic
  resonance
According to the theoretical results, the quantum searching algorithm can be
generalized by replacing the Walsh-Hadamard(W-H) transform by almost any
quantum mechanical operation. We have implemented the generalized algorithm
using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques with a solution of chloroform
molecules. Experimental results show the good agreement between theory and
experiment.
