Implementing quantum logic operations, pseudo-pure states and the
  Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using non-commuting selective pulses in NMR
We demonstrate experimentally the usefulness of selective pulses in NMR to
perform quantum computation. Three different techniques based on selective
pulse excitations have been proposed to prepare a spin system in a pseudo-pure
state. We describe the design of novel ``portmanteau'' gates using the
selective manipulation of level populations. A selective pulse implementation
of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for a two-qubit and a three-qubit quantum
computer is demonstrated.
