Channel Estimation with Noisy Entanglement
We analyze the Pauli-channel estimation with mixed nonseparable states. It
turns out that within a specific range entanglement can serve as a nonclassical
resource. However, this range is rather small, that is entanglement is not very
robust for this application. We further show that Werner states yield the best
result of all Bell diagonal states with the same amount of entanglement.
