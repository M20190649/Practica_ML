A Practical Scheme for Entanglement Concentration
We present a realistic purification scheme for pure non-maximally entangled
states. In the scheme, Alice and Bob at two distant parties first start with
two shared but less entangled photon pairs to produce a conditional four-photon
GHZ state, then perform a 45-degree polarization measurement onto one of the
two photons at each party such that the remaining two photons are projected
onto a maximally entangled state.
