Phase Coherence and Control of Stored Photonic Information
We report the demonstration of phase coherence and control for the recently
developed "light storage" technique. Specifically, we use a pulsed magnetic
field to vary the phase of atomic spin excitations which result from the
deceleration and storing of a light pulse in warm Rb vapor. We then convert the
spin excitations back into light and detect the resultant phase shift in an
optical interferometric measurement. The coherent storage of photon states in
matter is essential for the practical realization of many basic concepts in
quantum information processing.
