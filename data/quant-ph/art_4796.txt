Generic Quantum Block Compression
A generic approach for compiling any classical block compression algorithm
into a quantum block compression algorithm is presented. Using this technique,
compression asymptoticaly approaching the von Neumann entropy of a qubit source
can be achieved. The automatically compiled algorithms are competitive (in time
and space complexity) with hand constructed quantum block compression
algorithms.
