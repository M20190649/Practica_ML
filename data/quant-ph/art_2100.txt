Generating entangled superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable
  states within a parametric oscillator
We suggest a variant of the recently proposed experiment for the generation
of a new kind of Schroedinger-cat states, using two coupled parametric
down-converter nonlinear crystals [F. De Martini, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2842
(1998)]. We study the parametric oscillator case and find that an entangled
Schroedinger-cat type state of two cavities, whose mirrors are placed along the
output beams of the nonlinear crystals, can be realized under suitable
conditions.
