Noise-free scattering of the quantized electromagnetic field from a
  dispersive linear dielectric
We study the scattering of the quantized electromagnetic field from a linear,
dispersive dielectric using the scattering formalism for quantum fields. The
medium is modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators with a number of
distinct resonance frequencies. This model corresponds to the Sellmeir
expansion, which is widely used to describe experimental data for real
dispersive media. The integral equation for the interpolating field in terms of
the in field is solved and the solution used to find the out field. The
relation between the in and out creation and annihilation operators is found
which allows one to calculate the S-matrix for this system. In this model, we
find that there are absorption bands, but the input-output relations are
completely unitary. No additional quantum noise terms are required.
