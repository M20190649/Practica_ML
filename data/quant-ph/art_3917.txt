Limits of control for quantum systems: kinematical bounds on the
  optimization of observables and the question of dynamical realizability
In this paper we investigate the limits of control for mixed-state quantum
systems. The constraint of unitary evolution for non-dissipative quantum
systems imposes kinematical bounds on the optimization of arbitrary
observables. We summarize our previous results on kinematical bounds and show
that these bounds are dynamically realizable for completely controllable
systems. Moreover, we establish improved bounds for certain partially
controllable systems. Finally, the question of dynamical realizability of the
bounds for arbitary partially controllable systems is shown to depend on the
accessible sets of the associated control system on the unitary group U(N) and
the results of a few control computations are discussed briefly.
