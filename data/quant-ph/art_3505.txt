Phenomenological approach to introduce damping effects on radiation
  field states
In this work we propose an approach to deal with radiation field states which
incorporates damping effects at zero temperature. By using some well known
results on dissipation of a cavity field state, obtained by standard ab-initio
methods, it was possible to infer through a phenomenological way the explicit
form for the evolution of the state vector for the whole system: the
cavity-field plus reservoir. This proposal turns out to be of extreme
convenience to account for the influence of the reservoir over the cavity
field.
  To illustrate the universal applicability of our approach we consider the
attenuation effects on cavity-field states engineering. A proposal to maximize
the fidelity of the process is presented.
