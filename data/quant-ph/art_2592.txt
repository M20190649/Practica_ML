Gain Components in Autler-Townes Doublet from Quantum Interferences in
  Decay Channels
We consider non-degenerate pump-probe spectroscopy of V-systems under
conditions such that interference among decay channels is important. We
demonstrate how this interference can result in new gain features instead of
the usual absorption features. We relate this gain to the existence of a new
vacuum induced quasi-trapped-state. We further show how this also results in
large refractive index with low absorption.
