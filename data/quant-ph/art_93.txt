Quantum oblivious transfer protocols based on EPR states
We describe efficient protocols for quantum oblivious transfer and for
one-out-of-two quantum oblivious transfer. These protocols, which can be
implemented with present technology, are secure against general attacks as long
as the cheater can not store the bit for an arbitrarily long period of time.
