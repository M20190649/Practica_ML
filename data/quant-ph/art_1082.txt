Towards Even and Odd Squeezed Number States
The time evolution of even and odd squeezed states, as well as that of
squeezed number states, has been given in simple, analytic form. This follows
experimental work on trapped ions which has demonstrated even and odd coherent
states, number states, and squeezed (but not displaced) ground states. We
review this situation and consider the extension to even and odd squeezed
number states. Questions of uncertainty relations are also discussed.
