Larmor precession and barrier tunneling time of a neutral spinning
  particle
The Larmor precession of a neutral spinning particle in a magnetic field
confined to the region of a one dimensional-rectangular barrier is investigated
for both a nonrelativistic and a relativistic incoming particle. The spin
precession serves as a clock to measure the time spent by a quantum particle
traversing a potential barrier. With the help of general spin coherent state it
is explicitly shown that the precession time is equal to the dwell time in both
the nonrelativistic and relativistic cases. We also present a numerical
estimation of the precession time showing an apparent superluminal tunneling.
