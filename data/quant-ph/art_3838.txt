From quantum nonlocality to mind-brain interaction
Orthodox Copenhagen quantum theory renounces the quest to understand the
reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules that describe
connections between our observations. However, an examination of certain
nonlocal features of quantum theory suggests that the perceived need for this
renunciation was due to the uncritical importation from classical physics of a
crippling metaphysical prejudice, and that rejection of that prejudice opens
the way to a dynamical theory of the interaction between mind and brain that
has significant explanatory power.
