A Knob for Changing Light Propagation from Subluminal to Superluminal
We show how the application of a coupling field connecting the two lower
metastable states of a lambda-system can produce a variety of new results on
the propagation of a weak electromagnetic pulse. In principle the light
propagation can be changed from subluminal to superluminal. The negative group
index results from the regions of anomalous dispersion and gain in
susceptibility.
