Quantum Theory and Probabilities
It is often stated that quantum mechanics only makes statistical predictions
and that a quantum state is described by the various probability distributions
associated with it. Can we describe a quantum state completely in terms of
probabilities and then use it to describe quantum dynamics? What is the origin
of the probability distribution for a maximally specified quantum state?
  Is quantum mechanics `local' or is there an essential nonlocality
(nonseparability) inherent in quantum mechanics? These questions are discussed
in this paper. The decay of an unstable quantum state and the time dependence
of a minimum uncertainty states for future times as well as past times are also
discussed.
