Realistic teleportation with linear optical elements
We calculate the highest possible information gain in a measurement of
entangled states when employing a beamsplitter. The result is used to evaluate
the fidelity, averaged over all unknown inputs, in a realistic teleportation
protocol that takes account of the imperfect detection of Bell states. Finally,
we introduce a probabilistic teleportation scheme, where measurements are made
in a partially entangled basis.
