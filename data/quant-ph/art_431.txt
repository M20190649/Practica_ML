Peculiarities of Quantum Mechanics: Origins and Meaning
The most peculiar, specifically quantum, features of quantum mechanics ---
quantum nonlocality, indeterminism, interference of probabilities,
quantization, wave function collapse during measurement --- are explained on a
logical-geometrical basis. It is shown that truths of logical statements about
numerical values of quantum observables are quantum observables themselves and
are represented in quantum mechanics by density matrices of pure states.
Structurally, quantum mechanics is a result of applying non-Abelian symmetries
to truth operators and their eigenvectors --- wave functions. Wave functions
contain information about conditional truths of all possible logical statements
about physical observables and their correlations in a given physical system.
These correlations are logical, hence nonlocal, and exist when the system is
not observed. We analyze the physical conditions and logical and
decision-making operations involved in the phenomena of wave function collapse
and unpredictability of the results of measurements. Consistent explanations of
the Stern-Gerlach and EPR-Bohm experiments are presented."
