Discussion: Are There Material Objects in Bohm's Theory
Bedard has argued that the 'minimalist' interpretation of Bohm's theory
"do[es] not make sense", essentially because one cannot account for bonding
properties in terms of particles cofigurations alone. I argue that while this
point is correct, the minimalist interpretation never sought to provide such an
explanation (nor is it incumbant upon this interpretation to do so).
