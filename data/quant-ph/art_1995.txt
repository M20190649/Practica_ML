Uncertainty relation of Anandan-Aharonov and Intelligent states
The quantum states which satisfy the equality in the generalised uncertainty
relation are called intelligent states. We prove the existence of intelligent
states for the Anandan-Aharonov uncertainty relation based on the geometry of
the quantum state space for arbitrary parametric evolutions of quantum states
when the initial and final states are non-orthogonal.
