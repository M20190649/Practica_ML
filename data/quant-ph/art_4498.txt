On the local unitary equivalence of states of multi-partite systems
Two pure states of a multi-partite system are alway are related by a unitary
transformation acting on the Hilbert space of the whole system. This
transformation involves multi-partite transformations. On the other hand some
quantum information protocols such as the quantum teleportation and quantum
dense coding are based on equivalence of some classes of states of bi-partite
systems under the action of local (one-particle) unitary operations. In this
paper we address the question: ``Under what conditions are the two states
states, $\varrho$ and $\sigma$, of a multi-partite system locally unitary
equivalent?'' We present a set of conditions which have to be satisfied in
order that the two states are locally unitary equivalent. In addition, we study
whether it is possible to prepare a state of a multi-qudit system. which is
divided into two parts A and B, by unitary operations acting only on the
systems A and B, separately.
