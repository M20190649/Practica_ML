Asymptotic Quantum Parameter Estimation in Spin 1/2 System
For the precise estimation of the unknown quantum state, the independent
samples should be prepared. Can we reduce the error of the estimation by the
measurement using the quantum correlation between every sample? In this paper,
this question is treated in the parameter estimation for the unknown state.
