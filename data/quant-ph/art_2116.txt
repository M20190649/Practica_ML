Separability and entanglement in 2xN composite quantum systems
We show that all density operators of 2$\times N$--dimensional quantum
systems that remain invariant after partial transposition with respect to the
first system are separable. Based on this criterion, we derive a sufficient
separability condition for general density operators in such quantum systems.
We also give a simple proof of the separability criterion in $2\times
2$--dimensional systems [A. Peres, Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 77}, 1413 (1996)]
