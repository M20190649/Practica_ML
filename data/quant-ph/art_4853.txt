Gravitational effects on a rigid Casimir cavity
Vacuum fluctuations produce a force acting on a rigid Casimir cavity in a
weak gravitational field. Such a force is here evaluated and is found to have
opposite direction with respect to the gravitational acceleration; the order of
magnitude for a multi-layer cavity configuration is analyzed and experimental
detection is discussed, bearing in mind the current technological resources.
