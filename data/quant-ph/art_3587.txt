Inequalities for electron-field correlation functions
I show that there exists a class of inequalities between correlation
functions of different orders of a chaotic electron field. These inequalities
lead to the antibunching effect and are a consequence of the fact that
electrons are fermions -- indistinguishable particles with antisymmetric
states. The derivation of the inequalities is based on the known form of the
correlation functions for the chaotic state and on the properties of matrices
and determinants.
