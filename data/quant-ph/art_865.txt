Time scale, objectivity and irreversibility in quantum mechanics
It is argued that setting isolated systems as primary scope of field theory
and looking at particles as derived entities, the problem of an objective
anchorage of quantum mechanics can be solved and irreversibility acquires a
fundamental role. These general ideas are checked in the case of the Boltzmann
description of a dilute gas.
