Where and why the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi representation describes
  microstates of the Schr√∂dinger wave function
A generalized Hamilton-Jacobi representation describes microstates of the
Schr\"odinger wave function for bound states. At the very points that boundary
values are applied to the bound state Schr\"odinger wave function, the
generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics exhibits a nodal
singularity. For initial value problems, the two representations are
equivalent.
