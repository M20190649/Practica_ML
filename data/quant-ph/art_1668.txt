Dephasing of Josephson oscillations between two coupled Bose-Einstein
  condensates
We study the dynamics of the relative phase between two Bose-Einstein
condensates coupled via collisions and via a Josephson-like coupling. We derive
the equations of the motion for the relative phase and the relative number
operators from the second quantized Hamiltonian of the system using a quantum
field theoretical approach. We distinguish the cases in which the two
condensates are in the same trap or in two different traps and study the
influence of this difference on the first order correlation function of atomic
fields. In identical traps this function does not undergo dephasing. We
calculate the dephasing time for the case of different traps.
