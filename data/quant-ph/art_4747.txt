The unity between quantum field computation, real computation, and
  quantum computation
It is indicated that principal models of computation are indeed significantly
related. The quantum field computation model contains the quantum computation
model of Feynman. (The term "quantum field computer" was used by Freedman.)
Quantum field computation (as enhanced by Wightman's model of quantum field
theory) involves computation over the continuum which is remarkably related to
the real computation model of Smale. The latter model was established as a
generalization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is
well known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's
special relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical
mechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown
largely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational
complexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic
Polynomial time) problem of computer science, and also into the description of
Nature by fundamental physics theories.
