Hidden Subgroup States are Almost Orthogonal
It is well known that quantum computers can efficiently find a hidden
subgroup $H$ of a finite Abelian group $G$. This implies that after only a
polynomial (in $\log |G|$) number of calls to the oracle function, the states
corresponding to different candidate subgroups have exponentially small inner
product. We show that this is true for noncommutative groups also. We present a
quantum algorithm which identifies a hidden subgroup of an arbitrary finite
group $G$ in only a linear (in $\log |G|$) number of calls to the oracle
function. This is exponentially better than the best classical algorithm.
However our quantum algorithm requires an exponential amount of time, as in the
classical case.
