Phase Space Representation for Open Quantum Systems within the Lindblad
  Theory
The Lindblad master equation for an open quantum system with a Hamiltonian
containing an arbitrary potential is written as an equation for the Wigner
distribution function in the phase space representation. The time derivative of
this function is given by a sum of three parts: the classical one, the quantum
corrections and the contribution due to the opening of the system. In the
particular case of a harmonic oscillator, quantum corrections do not exist.
