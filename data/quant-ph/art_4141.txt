Solving Random Satisfiability Problems with Quantum Computers
Quantum computer algorithms can exploit the structure of random
satisfiability problems. This paper extends a previous empirical evaluation of
such an algorithm and gives an approximate asymptotic analysis accounting for
both the average and variation of amplitudes among search states with the same
costs. The analysis predicts good performance, on average, for a variety of
problems including those near a phase transition associated with a high
concentration of hard cases. Based on empirical evaluation for small problems,
modifying the algorithm in light of this analysis improves its performance. The
algorithm improves on both GSAT, a commonly used conventional heuristic, and
quantum algorithms ignoring problem structure.
