Quantum repeaters for communication
In quantum communication via noisy channels, the error probability scales
exponentially with the length of the channel. We present a scheme of a quantum
repeater that overcomes this limitation. The central idea is to connect a
string of (imperfect) entangled pairs of particles by using a novel nested
purification protocol, thereby creating a single distant pair of high fidelity.
The scheme tolerates general errors on the percent level.
