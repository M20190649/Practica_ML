Thermalized Displaced Squeezed Thermal States
In the coordinate representation of thermofield dynamics, we investigate the
thermalized displaced squeezed thermal state which involves two temperatures
successively. We give the wavefunction and the matrix element of the density
operator at any time, and accordingly calculate some quantities related to the
position, momentum and particle number operator, special cases of which are
consistent with the results in the literature. The two temperatures have
diffenent correlations with the squeeze and coherence components. Moreover,
different from the properties of the position and momentum, the average value
and variance of the particle number operator as well as the second-order
correlation function are time-independent.
