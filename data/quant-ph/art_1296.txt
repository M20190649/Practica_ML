Threshold and non-linear behavior of lasers of $Î›$ and V -
  configurations
Dynamic properties of closed three level laser systems are investigated. Two
schemes of pumping - $\Lambda$ and V - are considered. It is shown that the
non-linear behavior of the photon number as a function of pump both near and
far above threshold is crucially different for these two configurations. In
particular, it is found that in the high pump regime laser can turn off in a
phase-transition-like manner in both $\Lambda$ and V schemes.
