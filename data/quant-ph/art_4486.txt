Position measuring interactions and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
An indirect measurement model is constructed for an approximately repeatable,
precise position measuring apparatus that violates the assertion, sometimes
called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, that any position measuring
apparatus with noise epsilon brings the momentum disturbance no less than
hbar/2epsilon in any input state of the apparatus.
