Hyperfinite-Dimensional Representations of Canonical Commutation
  Relation
This paper presents some methods of representing canonical commutation
relations in terms of hyperfinite-dimensional matrices, which are constructed
by nonstandard analysis. The first method uses representations of a nonstandard
extension of finite Heisenberg group, called hyperfinite Heisenberg group. The
second is based on hyperfinite-dimensional representations of so(3). Then, the
cases of infinite degree of freedom are argued in terms of the algebra of
hyperfinite parafermi oscillators, which is mathematically equivalent to a
hyperfinite-dimensional representation of so(n).
