Quantum teleportation of EPR pair by three-particle entanglement
Teleportation of an EPR pair using triplet in state of the
Horne-Greenberger-Zeilinger form to two receivers is considered. It needs a
three-particle basis for joint measurement. By contrast the one qubit
teleportation the required basis is not maximally entangled. It consists of the
states corresponding to the maximally entanglement of two particles only. Using
outcomes of measurement both receivers can recover an unknown EPR state however
one of them can not do it separately. Teleportation of the N-particle
entanglement is discussed.
