Quantum repeaters based on entanglement purification
We study the use of entanglement purification for quantum communication over
long distances. For distances much longer than the coherence length of a
corresponding noisy quantum channel, the fidelity of transmission is usually so
low that standard purification methods are not applicable. It is however
possible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified
separately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping. This
method can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error
correction, as it makes explicit use of two-way classical communication. An
important question is how the noise, introduced by imperfect local operations
(that constitute the protocols of purification and the entanglement swapping),
accumulates in such a compound channel, and how it can be kept below a certain
noise level. To treat this problem, we first study the applicability and the
efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect
local operations. We then present a scheme that allows entanglement
purification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per-cent
level. It requires a polynomial overhead in time, and an overhead in local
resources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel.
