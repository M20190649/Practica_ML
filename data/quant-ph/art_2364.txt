Multipartite entanglement for continuous variables: A quantum
  teleportation network
We show that {\it one} single-mode squeezed state distributed among $N$
parties using linear optics suffices to produce a truly $N$-partite entangled
state for any nonzero squeezing and arbitrarily many parties. From this
$N$-partite entangled state, via quadrature measurements of $N-2$ modes,
bipartite entanglement between any two of the $N$ parties can be `distilled',
which enables quantum teleportation with an experimentally determinable
fidelity better than could be achieved in any classical scheme.
