Automatic Quantum Error Correction
Criteria are given by which dissipative evolution can transfer populations
and coherences between quantum subspaces, without a loss of coherence. This
results in a form of quantum error correction that is implemented by the joint
evolution of a system and a cold bath. It requires no external intervention
and, in principal, no ancilla. An example of a system that protects a qubit
against spin-flip errors is proposed. It consists of three spin 1/2 magnetic
particles and three modes of a resonator. The qubit is the triple quantum
coherence of the spins, and the photons act as ancilla.
