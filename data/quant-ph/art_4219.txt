Sundays in a Quantum Engineer's Life
I am a Quantum Engineer, but on Sundays I have principles, John Bell opened
his "underground colloquium" in March 1983, words which I will never forget!
What! John Bell, the great John Bell, presented himself as an engineer!?! one
of those people who make things work without even understanding how they
function?!? whereas I thought of John Bell as one of the greatest theoretician.
