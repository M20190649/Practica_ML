Manipulating the frequency entangled states by
  acoustic-optical-modulator
In this paper, we describe how to realize conditional frequency entanglement
swapping and to produce probabilisticly a three-photon frequency entangled
state from two pairs of frequency entangled states by using an
Acoustic-Optical-Modulator. Both schemes are very simple and may be
implementable in practice.
