Extended Quantum XOR Gate in Terms of Two-Spin Interactions
Considerations of feasibility of quantum computing lead to the study of
multispin quantum gates in which the input and output two-state systems (spins)
are not identical. We provide a general discussion of this approach and then
propose an explicit two-spin interaction Hamiltonian which accomplishes the
quantum XOR gate function for a system of three spins: two input and one
output.
