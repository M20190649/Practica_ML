Strengths and Weaknesses of Quantum Computing
Recently a great deal of attention has focused on quantum computation
following a sequence of results suggesting that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that
factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in
quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be
efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this
question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with
probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in
time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen
uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class $NP \cap coNP$ cannot be
solved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is
tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to
any oracle on a quantum computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.
