Quantum Spin Dynamics and Quantum Computation
We describe a simulation method for a quantum spin model of a generic,
general purpose quantum computer. The use of this quantum computer simulator is
illustrated through several implementations of Grover's database search
algorithm. Some preliminary results on the stability of quantum algorithms are
presented.
