On the Observables Describing a Quantum Reference Frame
A reference frame F is described by the element g of the Poincare' group P
which connects F with a given fixed frame F_0. If F is a quantum frame, defined
by a physical object following the laws of quantum physics, the parameters of g
have to be considered as quantum observables. However, these observables are
not compatible and some of them, namely the coordinates of the origin of F,
cannot be represented by self-adjoint operators. Both these difficulties can be
overcome by considering a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) on P,
covariant with respect to the left translations of the group, namely a
covariance system. We develop a construction procedure for this kind of
mathematical structure. The formalism is also used to discuss the quantum
observables measured with respect to a quantum reference frame.
