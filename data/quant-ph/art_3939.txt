Time Correlation in Tunneling of Photons
I propose to consider photon tunneling as a space-time correlation phenomenon
between the emission and absorption of a photon on the two sides of a barrier.
Standard technics based on an appropriate counting rate formula may then be
applied to derive the tunneling time distribution without any {\em ad hoc}
definition of this quantity. General formulae are worked out for a potential
model using Wigner-Weisskopf method. For a homogeneous square barrier in the
limit of zero tunneling probability a vanishing tunneling time is obtained.
