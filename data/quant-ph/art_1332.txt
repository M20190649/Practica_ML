QED commutation relations for inhomogeneous Kramers-Kronig dielectrics
Recently a quantization scheme for the phenomenological Maxwell theory of the
full electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous three-dimensional, dispersive,
and absorbing dielectric medium has been developed and applied to a system
consisting of two infinite half-spaces with a common planar interface (H.T.
Dung, L. Knoell, and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 57, in press). Here we show
that the scheme, which is based on the classical Green-tensor integral
representation of the electromagnetic field, applies to any inhomogeneous
medium. For this purpose we prove that the fundamental equal-time commutation
relations of QED are preserved for an arbitrarily space-dependent,
Kramers--Kronig consistent permittivity. Further, an extension of the
quantization scheme to linear media with bounded regions of amplification is
given, and the problem of anisotropic media is briefly addressed.
