Discrete Wigner functions and the phase space representation of quantum
  computers
We show how to represent the state and the evolution of a quantum computer
(or any system with an $N$--dimensional Hilbert space) in phase space. For this
purpose we use a discrete version of the Wigner function which, for arbitrary
$N$, is defined in a phase space grid of $2N\times 2N$ points. We compute such
Wigner function for states which are relevant for quantum computation. Finally,
we discuss properties of quantum algorithms in phase space and present the
phase space representation of Grover's quantum search algorithm.
