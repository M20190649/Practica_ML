On Stapp-Unruh-Mermin Discussion on Quantum Nonlocality: Quantum Jumps
  and Relativity
We argue that the participants of the discussion have overlooked an essential
circumstance, in view of which Stapp's fifth proposition fails. The
circumstance is that though $L$ and $R$ measurements, being causally separated,
are not invariantly time ordered, quantum-jump hypersurfaces associated with
the measurements are causelikewise ordered. Stapp's fifth proposition is true
iff $L$ hypersurface precedes $R$ one; but within the limits of special
relativity, it is impossible to determine the causelike order of those
hypersurfaces. The entire Stapp's construct is revised.
