Partial recovery of entanglement in bipartite entanglement
  transformations
Any deterministic bipartite entanglement transformation involving finite
copies of pure states and carried out using local operations and classical
communication (LOCC) results in a net loss of entanglement. We show that for
almost all such transformations, partial recovery of lost entanglement is
achievable by using $2 \times 2$ auxiliary entangled states, no matter how
large the dimensions of the parent states are. For the rest of the special
cases of deterministic LOCC transformations, we show that the dimension of the
auxiliary entangled state depends on the presence of equalities in the
majorization relations of the parent states. We show that genuine recovery is
still possible using auxiliary states in dimensions less than that of the
parent states for all patterns of majorization relations except only one
special case.
