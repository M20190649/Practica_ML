Gravity, energy conservation and parameter values in collapse models
We interpret the probability rule of the CSL collapse theory to mean that the
scalar field which causes collapse is the grvitational curvature scalar with
two sources, the expectation value of the mass density and a white noise
fluctuating source. We examine two models of the fluctuating source, monopole
fluctuations and dipole fluctuations, and show that these correspond to two
well known collapse models. We relate the two GRW parameters of CSL to
fundamental constants, and explain the energy increase as arising from the loss
of vacuum gravitational energy. It is shown how a problem with semi-classical
grvity may be cured when it is combined with a CSL collapse model.
