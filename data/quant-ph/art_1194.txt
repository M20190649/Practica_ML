Universal optimal cloning of qubits and quantum registers
We review our recent work on the universal (i.e. input state independent)
optimal quantum copying (cloning) of qubits. We present unitary transformations
which describe the optimal cloning of a qubit and we present the corresponding
quantum logical network. We also present network for an optimal quantum copying
``machine'' (transformation) which produces N+1 identical copies from the
original qubit. Here again the quality (fidelity) of the copies does not depend
on the state of the original and is only a function of the number of copies, N.
In addition, we present the machine which universaly and optimally clones
states of quantum objects in arbitrary-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
particular, we discuss universal cloning of quantum registers.
