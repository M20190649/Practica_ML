Lambda's, V's and optimal cloning with stimulated emission
We show that optimal universal cloning of the polarization state of photons
can be achieved via stimulated emission in three-level systems, both of the
Lambda and the V type. We establish the equivalence of our systems with coupled
harmonic oscillators, which permits us to analyze the structure of the cloning
transformations realized. These transformations are shown to be equivalent to
the optimal cloning transformations for qubits discovered by Buzek and Hillery,
and Gisin and Massar. The down-conversion cloner discovered previously by some
of the authors is obtained as a limiting case. We demonstrate an interesting
equivalence between systems of Lambda atoms and systems of pairwise entangled V
atoms. Finally we discuss the physical differences between our photon cloners
and the qubit cloners considered previously and prove that the bounds on the
fidelity of the clones derived for qubits also apply in our situation.
