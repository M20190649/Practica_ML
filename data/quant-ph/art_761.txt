A complementary group technique for the resolution of the outer
  multiplicity problem of SU(n): (II) A recoupling approach to the solution of
  SU(3)\supset U(2) reduced Wigner coefficients
A general procedure for the derivation of SU(3)\supset U(2) reduced Wigner
coefficients for the coupling (\lambda_{1}\mu_{1})\times
(\lambda_{2}\mu_{2})\downarrow (\lambda\mu)^{\eta}, where \eta is the outer
multiplicity label needed in the decomposition, is proposed based on a
recoupling approach according to the complementary group technique given in
(I). It is proved that the non-multiplicity-free reduced Wigner coefficients of
SU(n) are not unique with respect to canonical outer multiplicity labels, and
can be transformed from one set of outer multiplicity labels to another. The
transformation matrices are elements of SO(m), where m is the number of
occurrence of the corresponding irrep (\lambda\mu) in the decomposition
(\lambda_{1}\mu_{1})\times (\lambda_{2}\mu_{2})\downarrow (\lambda\mu). Thus, a
kind of the reduced Wigner coefficients with multiplicity is obtained after a
special SO(m) transformation. New features of this kind of reduced Wigner
coefficients and the differences from the reduced Wigner coefficients with
other choice of the multiplicity label given previously are discussed. The
method can also be applied to the derivation of general SU(n) Wigner or reduced
Wigner coefficients with multiplicity. Algebraic expression of another kind of
reduced Wigner coefficients, the so-called reduced auxiliary Wigner
coefficients for SU(3)\supset U(2), are also obtained.
