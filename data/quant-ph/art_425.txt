Distillability of Inseparable Quantum Systems
We apply the inseparability criterion for $2 \times 2$ systems, local
filtering and Bennett et al. purification protocol [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76},
722 (1996)] to show how to distill {\it any} inseparable $2\times 2$ system.
The extended protocol is illustrated geometrically by means of the state
parameters in the Hilbert-Schmidt space.
