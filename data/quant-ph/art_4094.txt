Detecting the inseparability and distillability of continuous variable
  states in Fock space
The partial transposition(PT) operation is an effecient tool in detecting the
inseparability of a mixed state. We give an explicit formula for the PT
operation for the continuous variable states in Fock space. We then give the
necessary and sufficient condition for the positivity of Gaussian operators.
Based on this, a number of creterions on the inseparability and distillability
for the multimode Gaussian states are naturally drawn. We finally give an
explicit formula for the state in a subspace of a global Gaussian state. This
formula, together with the known results for Gaussian states, gives the
criterions for the inseparability and distillability in a subspace of the
global Gaussian state.
