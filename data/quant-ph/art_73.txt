Quantum Cryptography
Quantum cryptography is a new method for secret communications offering the
ultimate security assurance of the inviolability of a Law of Nature. In this
paper we shall describe the theory of quantum cryptography, its potential
relevance and the development of a prototype system at Los Alamos, which
utilises the phenomenon of single-photon interference to perform quantum
cryptography over an optical fiber communications link.
