Exact quantum states of a general time-dependent quadratic system from
  classical action
A generalization of driven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass and
frequency, by adding total time-derivative terms to the Lagrangian, is
considered. The generalization which gives a general quadratic Hamiltonian
system does not change the classical equation of motion. Based on the
observation by Feynman and Hibbs, the propagators (kernels) of the systems are
calculated from the classical action, in terms of solutions of the classical
equation of motion: two homogeneous and one particular solutions. The kernels
are then used to find wave functions which satisfy the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. One of the wave functions is shown to be that of a Gaussian pure
state. In every case considered, we prove that the kernel does not depend on
the way of choosing the classical solutions, while the wave functions depend on
the choice. The generalization which gives a rather complicated quadratic
Hamiltonian is simply interpreted as acting an unitary transformation to the
driven harmonic oscillator system in the Hamiltonian formulation.
