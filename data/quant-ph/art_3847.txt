Equally-distant partially-entangled alphabet states for quantum channels
Each Bell state has the property that by performing just local operations on
one qubit, the complete Bell basis can be generated. That is, states generated
by local operations are totally distinguishable. This remarkable property is
due to maximal quantum entanglement between the two particles. We present a set
of local unitary transformations that generate out of partially entangled
two-qubit state a set of four maximally distinguishable states that are
mutually equally distant. We discuss quantum dense coding based on these
alphabet states.
