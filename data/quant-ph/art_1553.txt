Quantum Rate-Distortion Coding
I introduce rate-distortion theory for quantum coding, and derive a lower
bound, involving the coherent information, on the rate at which qubits must be
used to encode a quantum source with a given maximum level of distortion per
source emission. The convexity of the "information rate-distortion function"
which defines this bound is also derived.
