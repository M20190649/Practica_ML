Sending Quantum Information with Gaussian States
Quantum information characteristics, such as quantum mutual information,
loss, noise and coherent information are explicitly calculated for Bosonic
attenuation/amplification channel with input Gaussian state. The coherent
information is shown to be negative for the values of the attenuation
coefficient $k<1/\sqrt{2}$.
