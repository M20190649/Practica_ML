Causality, delocalization and positivity of energy
In a series of interesting papers G. C. Hegerfeldt has shown that quantum
systems with positive energy initially localized in a finite region,
immediately develop infinite tails. In our paper Hegerfeldt's theorem is
analysed using quantum and classical wave packets. We show that Hegerfeldt's
conclusion remains valid in classical physics. No violation of Einstein's
causality is ever involved. Using only positive frequencies, complex wave
packets are constructed which at $t = 0$ are real and finitely localized and
which, furthemore, are superpositions of two nonlocal wave packets. The
nonlocality is initially cancelled by destructive interference. However this
cancellation becomes incomplete at arbitrary times immediately afterwards. In
agreement with relativity the two nonlocal wave packets move with the velocity
of light, in opposite directions.
