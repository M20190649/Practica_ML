Comment on "Non-contextual hidden variables and physical measurements"
Kent's conclusion that ``non-contextual hidden variable theories cannot be
excluded by theoretical arguments of the Kochen-Specker type once the
imprecision in real world experiments is taken into account'' [Phys. Rev. Lett.
83, 3755 (1999)], is criticized. The Kochen-Specker theorem just points out
that it is impossible even conceive a hidden variable model in which the
outcomes of all measurements are pre-determined; it does not matter if these
measurements are performed or not, or even if these measurements can be
achieved only with finite precision.
