Visibility, efficiency, and Bell violations in real
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments
The violation of Bell's inequalities in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments
has been demonstrated for photons and ions. In all experiments of this kind the
relation between visibility, efficiency, and Bell violation is generally
unknown. In this paper we show that simulations based on a local hidden
variables models for entangled photons provide this information. It is
established that these properties are closely related by the way, in which
photons are detected after a polarizer beam splitter. On this basis we suggest
controlled experiments which, for the first time, subject the superposition
principle to experimental tests.
