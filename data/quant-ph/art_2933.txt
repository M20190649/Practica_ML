Quantum Particle-Trajectories and Geometric Phase
"Particle"-trajectories are defined as integrable $dx_\mu dp^\mu = 0$ paths
in projective space.
  Quantum states evolving on such trajectories, open or closed, do not
delocalise in $(x, p)$ projection, the phase associated with the trajectories
being related to the geometric (Berry) phase and the Classical Mechanics
action. High Energy Physics properties of states evolving on
"particle"-trajectories are discussed.
