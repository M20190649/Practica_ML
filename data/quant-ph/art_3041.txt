Efficient factorization with a single pure qubit and $log N$ mixed
  qubits
It is commonly assumed that Shor's quantum algorithm for the efficient
factorization of a large number $N$ requires a pure initial state. Here we
demonstrate that a single pure qubit together with a collection of $log_2 N$
qubits in an arbitrary mixed state is sufficient to implement Shor's
factorization algorithm efficiently.
