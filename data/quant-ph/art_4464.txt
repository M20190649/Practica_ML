Bayes' theorem and quantum retrodiction
We derive on the basis of Bayes' theorem a simple but general expression for
the retrodicted premeasurement state associated with the result of any
measurement. The retrodictive density operator is the normalised probability
operator measure element associated with the result. We examine applications to
quantum optical cryptography and to the optical beam splitter.
