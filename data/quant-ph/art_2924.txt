Mixedness and teleportation
We show that on exceeding a certain degree of mixedness (as quantified by the
von Neumann entropy), entangled states become useless for teleporatation. By
increasing the dimension of the entangled systems, this entropy threshold can
be made arbitrarily close to maximal. This entropy is found to exceed the
entropy threshold sufficient to ensure the failure of dense coding.
