More about Dynamical Reduction and the Enumeration Principle
In view of the arguments put forward by Clifton and Monton [1999] in a recent
preprint, we reconsider the alleged conflict of dynamical reduction models with
the enumeration principle. We prove that our original analysis of such a
problem is correct, that the GRW model does not meet any difficulty and that
the reasoning of the above authors is inappropriate since it does not take into
account the correct interpretation of the dynamical reduction theories.
