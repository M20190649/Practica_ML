One- and two-dimensional N-qubit systems in capacitively coupled quantum
  dots
Coulomb blockade effects in capacitively coupled quantum dots can be utilized
for constructing an N-qubit system with antiferromagnetic Ising interactions.
Starting from the tunneling Hamiltonian, we theoretically show that the
Hamiltonian for a weakly coupled quantum-dot array is reduced to that for
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Quantum operations are carried
out by applying only electrical pulse sequences. Thus various error-correction
methods developed in NMR spectroscopy and NMR quantum computers are applicable
without using magnetic fields. A possible measurement scheme in an N-qubit
system is quantitatively discussed.
