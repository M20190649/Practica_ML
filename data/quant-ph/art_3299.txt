Quantum Bit Escrow
Unconditionally secure bit commitment and coin flipping are known to be
impossible in the classical world. Bit commitment is known to be impossible
also in the quantum world. We introduce a related new primitive - {\em quantum
bit escrow}. In this primitive Alice commits to a bit $b$ to Bob. The
commitment is {\em binding} in the sense that if Alice is asked to reveal the
bit, Alice can not bias her commitment without having a good probability of
being detected cheating. The commitment is {\em sealing} in the sense that if
Bob learns information about the encoded bit, then if later on he is asked to
prove he was playing honestly, he is detected cheating with a good probability.
Rigorously proving the correctness of quantum cryptographic protocols has
proved to be a difficult task. We develop techniques to prove quantitative
statements about the binding and sealing properties of the quantum bit escrow
protocol.
  A related primitive we construct is a quantum biased coin flipping protocol
where no player can control the game, i.e., even an all-powerful cheating
player must lose with some constant probability, which stands in sharp contrast
to the classical world where such protocols are impossible.
