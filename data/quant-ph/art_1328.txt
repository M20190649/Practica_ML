Conditionally exactly solvable potentials: A supersymmetric construction
  method
We present in this paper a rather general method for the construction of
so-called conditionally exactly solvable potentials. This method is based on
algebraic tools known from supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Various families
of one-dimensional potentials are constructed whose corresponding Schr\"odinger
eigenvalue problem can be solved exactly under certain conditions of the
potential parameters. Examples of quantum systems on the real line, the half
line as well as on some finite interval are studied in detail.
