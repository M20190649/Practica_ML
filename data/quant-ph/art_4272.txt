Introducing Quantum Discord
Two classically identical expressions for the mutual information generally
differ when the two systems involved are quantum. We investigate this
difference -- quantum discord -- and show that it can be used as a criterion
for the classicality of the correlations. We also show that quantum discord can
be used for describing the selection of the preferred, effectively classical,
pointer states.
