Quantum Computing
The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical
information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to
summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum
information theory. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics
fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, the review
begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer
science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines
and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then
outlined, and the EPR experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and
quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which
distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum
from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are described,
including key distribution, teleportation, data compression, quantum error
correction, the universal quantum computer and quantum algorithms. The common
theme of all these ideas is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational
resource. Experimental methods for small quantum processors are briefly
sketched, concentrating on ion traps, high Q cavities, and NMR. The review
concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics,
and avenues for future research.
