Universal Quantum Entanglement Concentration Gate
We construct a Universal Quantum Entanglement Concentration Gate (QEC-Gate).
Special times operations of QEC-Gate can transform a pure 2-level bipartite
entangled state to nearly maximum entanglement. The transformation can attain
any required fidelity with optimal probability by adjusting concentration step.
We also generate QEC-Gate to the Schmidt decomposable multi-partite system.
