Semicausal operations are semilocalizable
We prove a conjecture by DiVincenzo, which in the terminology of Preskill et
al. [quant-ph/0102043] states that ``semicausal operations are
semilocalizable''. That is, we show that any operation on the combined system
of Alice and Bob, which does not allow Bob to send messages to Alice, can be
represented as an operation by Alice, transmitting a quantum particle to Bob,
and a local operation by Bob. The proof is based on the uniqueness of the
Stinespring representation for a completely positive map. We sketch some of the
problems in transferring these concepts to the context of relativistic quantum
field theory.
