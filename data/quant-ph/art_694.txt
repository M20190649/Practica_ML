Quantum Isomorphic Simulation
A new type of quantum simulator is proposed which can simulate any quantum
many-body system in an isomorphic manner. It can actually synthesize a
duplicate of the system to be simulated. The isomorphic simulation has the
great advantage that the inevitable coupling of the simulator to the
environment can be fully exploited in simulating thermodynamic processes.
