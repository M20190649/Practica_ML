Realizing the quantum baker's map on an NMR quantum computer
By numerically simulating an implementation of the quantum baker's map on a
3-qubit NMR quantum computer based on the molecule trichloroethylene, we
demonstrate the feasibility of quantum chaos experiments on present-day quantum
computers. We give detailed descriptions of proposed experiments that
investigate (a) the rate of entropy increase due to decoherence and (b) the
phenomenon of hypersensitivity to perturbation.
