Experimental demonstration of ground state laser cooling with
  electromagnetically induced transparency
Ground state laser cooling of a single trapped ion is achieved using a
technique which tailors the absorption profile for the cooling laser by
exploiting electromagnetically induced transparency in the Zeeman structure of
a dipole transition. This new method is robust, easy to implement and proves
particularly useful for cooling several motional degrees of freedom
simultaneously, which is of great practical importance for the implementation
of quantum logic schemes with trapped ions.
