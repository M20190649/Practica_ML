Quantum key distribution with bright entangled beams
We suggest a quantum cryptographic scheme using continuous EPR-like
correlations of bright optical beams. For binary key encoding, the continuous
information is discretized in a novel way by associating a respective
measurement, amplitude or phase, with a bit value "1" or "0". The secure key
distribution is guaranteed by the quantum correlations. No pre-determined
information is sent through the quantum channel contributing to the security of
the system.
