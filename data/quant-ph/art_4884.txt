Comment on "Stable Quantum Computation of Unstable Classical Chaos"
This is a 1-page comment on a wrong paper that recently appeared in PRL
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (23), 5393 (2001), also quant-ph/0101004). The authors
claim to have shown that using a quantum computer gives an "exponential
advantage" for simulating and studying classical chaotic systems.
