Quantum Communication with Correlated Nonclassical States
Nonclassical correlations between the quadrature-phase amplitudes of two
spatially separated optical beams are exploited to realize a two-channel
quantum communication experiment with a high degree of immunity to
interception. For this scheme, either channel alone can have an arbitrarily
small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for transmission of a coherent ``message''.
However, when the transmitted beams are combined properly upon authorized
detection, the encoded message can in principle be recovered with the original
SNR of the source. An experimental demonstration has achieved a 3.2 dB
improvement in SNR over that possible with correlated classical sources.
Extensions of the protocol to improve its security against eavesdropping are
discussed.
