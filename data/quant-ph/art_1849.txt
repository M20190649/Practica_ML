Bloch-Like Quantum Multiple Reflections of Atoms
We show that under certain circumstances an atom can follow an oscillatory
motion in a periodic laser profile with a Gaussian envelope. These oscillations
can be well explained by using a model of energetically forbidden spatial
regions. The similarities and differences with Bloch oscillations are
discussed. We demonstrate that the effect exists not only for repulsive but
also for attractive potentials, i.e. quantum multiple reflections are also
possible.
