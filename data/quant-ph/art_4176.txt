Reply to Comment on ``Proposal for the Measurement of Bell-Type
  Correlations from Continuous Variables''
Recently K. Banaszek, I. A. Walmsley, K. Wodkiewicz (quant-ph/0012097)
commented on our Proposal for the Measurement of Bell-Type Correlations from
Continuous Variables [T. C. Ralph, W. J. Munro, R. E. S. Polkinghorne, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 85, 2035 (2000)]. Their comment is based on a blatant misreading and
misunderstanding of our letter and as such is simply wrong.
