Defending Time-Symmetrized Quantum Theory
Recently, several authors have criticized time-symmetrized quantum theory
originated by the work of Aharonov et al. (1964). The core of this criticism
was the proof, which appeared in various forms, showing that counterfactual
interpretation of time-symmetrized quantum theory cannot be reconciled with the
standard quantum theory. I argue here that the apparent contradiction appears
due to inappropriate usage of traditional time asymmetric approach to
counterfactuals, and that the contradiction disappears when the problem is
analyzed in terms of time-symmetric counterfactuals. I analyze various aspects
of time-symmetry of quantum theory and defend the time-symmetrized formalism.
