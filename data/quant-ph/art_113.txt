Interaction-Free Preparation
We demonstrate that the preparation of a very well localized atom beam is
possible without physical interaction. The preparation is based on the
selection of an adequate ensemble of atoms of an originally wide beam by means
of information obtained with a neutron interferometer. In such a case the
uncertainty relation can no longer be interpreted as a by-product of the
interaction between the system and the preparation apparatus.
