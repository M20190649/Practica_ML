Motion of vortex lines in quantum mechanics
Exact analytic solutions of the time dependent Schrodinger equation are
produced that exhibit a variety of vortex structures. The qualitative analysis
of the motion of vortex lines is presented and various types of vortex behavior
are identified. Vortex creation and annihilation and vortex interactions are
illustrated in the special cases of the free motion, the motion in the harmonic
potential, and in the constant magnetic field. Similar analysis of the vortex
motions is carried out also for a relativistic wave equation.
