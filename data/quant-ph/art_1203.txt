Quasi-Exactly Solvable Potentials with Two Known Eigenstates
A new supersymmetry method for the generation of the quasi-exactly solvable
(QES) potentials with two known eigenstates is proposed. Using this method we
obtained new QES potentials for which we found in explicit form the energy
levels and wave functions of the ground state and first excited state.
