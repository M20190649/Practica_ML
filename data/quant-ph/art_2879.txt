A remark on the isotropic model
The applicability of the so-called isotropic and anisotropic complete
photonic-band-gap (CPBG) models [S. John and J. Wang, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
64}, 2418 (1990)] to capture essential features of the spontaneous emission
(SE) of a fluorescent atom or molecule near a band-gap-edge of a CPBG structure
is discussed.
