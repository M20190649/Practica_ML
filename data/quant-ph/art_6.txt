Infinite matrices may violate the associative law
The momentum operator for a particle in a box is represented by an infinite
order Hermitian matrix $P$. Its square $P^2$ is well defined (and diagonal),
but its cube $P^3$ is ill defined, because $P P^2\neq P^2 P$. Truncating these
matrices to a finite order restores the associative law, but leads to other
curious results.
