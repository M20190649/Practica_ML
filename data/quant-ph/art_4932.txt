Similarity between Grover's quantum search algorithm and classical
  two-body collisions
By studying the attribute of the inversion about average operation in quantum
searching algorithm, we find the similarity between the quantum searching and
the course of two rigid bodies'collision. Some related questions are discussed
from this similarity.
