Unified treatment of screening Coulomb and anharmonic oscillator
  potentials in arbitrary dimensions
A mapping is obtained relating radial screened Coulomb systems with low
screening parameters to radial anharmonic oscillators in N-dimensional space.
Using the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, it is shown that exact
solutions of these potentials exist when the parameters satisfy certain
constraints.
