A new entanglement measure induced by the Hilbert-Schmidt norm
In this letter we discuss a new entanglement measure. It is based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of operators. We give an explicit formula for calculating
the entanglement of a large set of states on C^2 \times C^2. Furthermore we
find some relations between the entanglement of relative entropy and the
Hilbert-Schmidt entanglement. A rigorous definition of partial transposition is
given in the appendix.
