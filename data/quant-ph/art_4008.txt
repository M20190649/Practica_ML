Spectral decomposition of Bell's operators for qubits
The spectral decomposition is given for the N-qubit Bell operators with two
observables per qubit. It is found that the eigenstates (when non-degenerate)
are N-qubit GHZ states even for those operators that do not allow the maximal
violation of the corresponding inequality. We present two applications of this
analysis. In particular, we discuss the existence of pure entangled states that
do not violate any Mermin-Klyshko inequality for $N\geq 3$.
