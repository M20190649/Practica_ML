Quantum Mechanics and Algorithmic Randomness
A long sequence of tosses of a classical coin produces an apparently random
bit string, but classical randomness is an illusion: the algorithmic
information content of a classically-generated bit string lies almost entirely
in the description of initial conditions. This letter presents a simple
argument that, by contrast, a sequence of bits produced by tossing a quantum
coin is, almost certainly, genuinely (algorithmically) random. This result can
be interpreted as a strengthening of Bell's no-hidden-variables theorem, and
relies on causality and quantum entanglement in a manner similar to Bell's
original argument.
