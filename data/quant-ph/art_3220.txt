Welcher Weg Experiments and the Orthodox Bohr's Complementarity
  Principle
In its most orthodox form, Bohr's Complementarity Principle states that a
quanton (a quantum system consisting of a Boson or Fermion) can either behave
as a particle or as wave, but never simultaneosuly as both. A less orthodox
interpretation of this Principle is the ``duality condition'' embodied in a
mathematical inequality due to Englert [B-G Englert, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 77,
2154 (1996)] which allows wave and particle attributes to co-exist, but
postulates that a stronger manifestation of the particle nature leads to a
weaker manifestation of the wave nature and vice versa. In this Letter, we show
that some recent {\it welcher weg} ("which path") experiments in
interferometers and similar set-ups, that claim to have validated, or
invalidated, the Complementarity Principle, actually shed no light on the
orthodox interpretation. They may have instead validated the weaker duality
condition, but even that is not completely obvious. We propose simple
modifications to these experiments which we believe can test the orthodox
Complementarity Principle and also shed light on the nature of wavefunction
collapse and quantum erasure.
