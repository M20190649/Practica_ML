On the classical hydrodynamic limit of quantum field theories
We discuss the transition from a quantum to a classical domain for a model
where a separation into environment and system is explicitely not given.
Utilizing the coarse graining procedure for free quantum fields we also apply
the projection method and the Hamiltonian principle to study possible cases of
emergent classicality. General conditions for classical dynamics are given.
Eventually, they lead to the equations of motion for a perfect classical fluid.
