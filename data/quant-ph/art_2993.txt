Coherent states, displaced number states and Laguerre polynomial states
  for su(1,1) Lie algebra
The ladder operator formalism of a general quantum state for su(1,1) Lie
algebra is obtained. The state bears the generally deformed oscillator
algebraic structure. It is found that the Perelomov's coherent state is a
su(1,1) nonlinear coherent state. The expansion and the exponential form of the
nonlinear coherent state are given. We obtain the matrix elements of the
su(1,1) displacement operator in terms of the hypergeometric functions and the
expansions of the displaced number states and Laguerre polynomial states are
followed. Finally some interesting su(1,1) optical systems are discussed.
