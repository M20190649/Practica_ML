Security of Quantum Key Distribution Against All Collective Attacks
Security of quantum key distribution against sophisticated attacks is among
the most important issues in quantum information theory. In this work we prove
security against a very important class of attacks called collective attacks
(under a compatible noise model) which use quantum memories and gates, and
which are directed against the final key. Although attacks stronger than the
collective attacks can exist in principle, no explicit example was found and it
is conjectured that security against collective attacks implies also security
against any attack.
