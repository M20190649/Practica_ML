Information-theoretic approach to quantum error correction and
  reversible measurement
Quantum operations provide a general description of the state changes allowed
by quantum mechanics. The reversal of quantum operations is important for
quantum error-correcting codes, teleportation, and reversing quantum
measurements. We derive information-theoretic conditions and equivalent
algebraic conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a general quantum
operation to be reversible. We analyze the thermodynamic cost of error
correction and show that error correction can be regarded as a kind of
``Maxwell demon,'' for which there is an entropy cost associated with
information obtained from measurements performed during error correction. A
prescription for thermodynamically efficient error correction is given.
