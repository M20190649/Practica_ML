Quantum MacWilliams Identities
We derive a relationship between two different notions of fidelity
(entanglement fidelity and average fidelity) for a completely depolarizing
quantum channel. This relationship gives rise to a quantum analog of the
MacWilliams identities in classical coding theory. These identities relate the
weight enumerator of a code to the one of its dual and, with linear programming
techniques, provided a powerful tool to investigate the possible existence of
codes. The same techniques can be adapted to the quantum case. We give examples
of their power.
