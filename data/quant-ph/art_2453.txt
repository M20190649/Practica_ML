NMR Quantum Logic Gates for Homonuclear Spin Systems
If NMR systems are to be used as practical quantum computers, the number of
coupled spins will need to be so large that it is not feasible to rely on
purely heteronuclear spin systems. The implementation of a quantum logic gate
imposes certain constraints on the motion of those spins not directly involved
in that gate, the so-called "spectator" spins; they must be returned to their
initial states at the end of the sequence. As a result, a homonuclear spin
system where there is appreciable coupling between every pair of spins would
seem to require a refocusing scheme that doubles in complexity and duration for
every additional spectator spin. Fortunately, for the more realistic practical
case where long-range spin-spin couplings can be neglected, simpler refocusing
schemes can be devised where the overall duration of the sequence remains
constant and the number of soft pulses increases only linearly with the number
of spectator spins. These ideas are tested experimentally on a six qubit
system: the six coupled protons of inosine.
