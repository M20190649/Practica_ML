Metaplectic Covariance of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal Quantization
  and Beyond
The metaplectic covariance for all forms of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal
quantization is established with different realizations of the inhomogeneous
symplectic algebra. Beyond that, in its most general form $W_{\infty}$
-covariance of this quantization scheme is investigated, and explicit
expressions for the quantum-deformed Hamiltonian vector fields are presented.
In a general basis the structure constants of the $W_{\infty}$-algebra are
obtained and its subalgebras are analyzed.
