A possible way to look at the last and future events for two-level
  system
In view of a three-dimensional picture (3D) of probability to find a particle
at a plane of the frequency and the time (PTF) becomes that process of
absorption and process of radiation for two - level system have different
direction on the time. Both processes are in the past or in the future
depending on named transition due to reversible model of the two-level atom.
The opportunity to know the last history of the resonant event for the
absorption process is for quantum interference interaction or for the resonant
radiation. On the contrary, to predict the resonant event in the future is
possible only by use near resonant atom-field absorption or by use radiation at
a fixed time. The problem of life time for a particle is entered through time
of spontaneous radiation connected with trajectory of the quantum transition.
It is offered to connect a trajectory of a particle during quantum transitions
with distribution of probability to find a particle. The conception of the
spectral history for events due to probability distribution is introduced for
next discussion.
