Comment on Book Review of `Quantum Evolution' (Johnjoe McFadden) by
  Mathew J. Donald
This paper is a response to the critical review by Mathew J. Donald of the
popular science book 'Quantum Evolution' by Johnjoe McFadden and our earlier
paper (by Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili), in which we propose a quantum
mechanical explanation for certain types of mutation. We here address Donald's
criticisms and reassert our proposal.
