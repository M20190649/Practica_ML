Dense Coding for Continuous Variables
A scheme to achieve dense quantum coding for the quadrature amplitudes of the
electromagnetic field is presented. The protocol utilizes shared entanglement
provided by nondegenerate parametric down conversion in the limit of large gain
to attain high efficiency. For a constraint in the mean number of photons n
associated with modulation in the signal channel, the channel capacity for
dense coding is found to be ln(1+n+n^2), which always beats coherent-state
communication and surpasses squeezed-state communication for n>1. For n>>1, the
dense coding capacity approaches twice that of either scheme.
