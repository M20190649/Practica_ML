Quantum Nonlocality in Phase Space
We propose an experiment demonstrating the nonlocality of a quantum
singlet-like state generated from a single photon incident on a beam splitter.
Each of the two spatially separated apparatuses in the setup performs a
strongly unbalanced homodyning, employing a single photon counting detector. We
show that the correlation functions violating the Bell inequalities in the
proposed experiment are given by the joint two-mode Q-function and the Wigner
function of the optical singlet-like state. This establishes a direct
relationship between two intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics: the
nonlocality of entangled states and the noncommutativity of quantum
observables, which underlies the nonclassical structure of phase space
quasidistribution functions.
