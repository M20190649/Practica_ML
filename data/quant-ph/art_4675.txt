Experimental Implementation of Hogg's Algorithm on a Three-Quantum-bit
  NMR Quantum Computer
Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques with three-qubit sample, we
have experimentally implemented the highly structured algorithm for the 1-SAT
problem proposed by Hogg. A simplified temporal averaging procedure was
employed to the three-qubit spin pseudo-pure state. The algorithm was completed
with only a single evaluation of structure of the problem and the solutions
were found with probability 100%, which outperform both unstructured quantum
and the best classical search algorithm.
