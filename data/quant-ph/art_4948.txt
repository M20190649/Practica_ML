Bell Inequalities and Pseudo-functional densities
A local hidden variable model with pseudo-functional density function
restricted to a binary probability event space is demonstrated to be able to
reproduce the quantum correlation in an Einstein Podolsky Rosen Bohm and
Aharonov type of experiment.
  In the density function use is made of Hadamard's finite part which disables
the possibility to derive Bell's inequality from models with such a type of
density function.
