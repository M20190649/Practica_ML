Adiabatic Output Coupling of a Bose Gas at Finite Temperatures
We develop a general theory of adiabatic output coupling from trapped atomic
Bose-Einstein Condensates at finite temperatures. For weak coupling, the output
rate from the condensate, and the excited levels in the trap, settles in a time
proportional to the inverse of the spectral width of the coupling to the output
modes. We discuss the properties of the output atoms in the quasi-steady-state
where the population in the trap is not appreciably depleted. We show how the
composition of the output beam, containing condensate and thermal component,
may be controlled by changing the frequency of the output coupler. This
composition determines the first and second order coherence of the output beam.
We discuss the changes in the composition of the bose gas left in the trap and
show how nonresonant output coupling can stimulate either the evaporation of
thermal excitations in the trap or the growth of non-thermal excitations, when
pairs of correlated atoms leave the condensate.
