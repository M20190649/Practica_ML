Quantum computation with abelian anyons
A universal quantum computer can be constructed using abelian anyons. Two
qubit quantum logic gates such as controlled-NOT operations are performed using
topological effects. Single-anyon operations such as hopping from site to site
on a lattice suffice to perform all quantum logic operations. Quantum
computation using abelian anyons shares some but not all of the robustness of
quantum computation using non-abelian anyons.
