Phase properties of hypergeometric states and negative hypergeometric
  states
We show that the three quantum states (P$\acute{o}$lya states, the
generalized non-classical states related to Hahn polynomials and negative
hypergeometric states) introduced recently as intermediates states which
interpolate between the binomial states and negative binomial states are
essentially identical. By using the Hermitial-phase-operator formalism, the
phase properties of the hypergeometric states and negative hypergeometric
states are studied in detail. We find that the number of peaks of phase
probability distribution is one for the hypergeometric states and $M$ for the
negative hypergeometric states.
