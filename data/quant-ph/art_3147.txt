Spiked and PT-symmetrized decadic potentials supporting elementary
  N-plets of bound states
We show that the potential wells with a central spike
  V(x) = x^{10} + a x^8 + b x^6+ c x^4 + d x^2 + f/x^2 possess arbitrary finite
multiplets of elementary exact bound states. The strong asymptotic growth of
V(x) implies an ambiguity in the PT-symmetric quantization via complex boundary
conditions but the three eligible recipes coincide at our exceptional
solutions.
