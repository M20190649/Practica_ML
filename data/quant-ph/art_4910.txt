A Dynamical Theory of Markovian Diffusion
A dynamical treatment of Markovian diffusion is presented and several
applications discussed. The stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics is
considered within this framework. A model for Brownian movement which includes
second order quantum effects is derived.
