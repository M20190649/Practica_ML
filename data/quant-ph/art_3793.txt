Quantum Mechanics and the Cookie Cutter Paradigm
What has so far prevented us from decrypting quantum mechanics is the Cookie
Cutter Paradigm, according to which the world's synchronic multiplicity derives
from surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three-dimensional cookie
cutters. This insidious notion is shown to be rooted in our neurophysiological
make-up. An effort is made to liberate the physical world from this innate
fallacy.
