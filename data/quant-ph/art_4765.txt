Quantum version of the Monty Hall problem
A version of the Monty Hall problem is presented where the players are
permitted to select quantum strategies. If the initial state involves no
entanglement the Nash equilibrium in the quantum game offers the players
nothing more than can be obtained with a classical mixed strategy. However, if
the initial state involves entanglement of the qubits of the two players, it is
advantageous for one player to have access to a quantum strategy while the
other does not. Where both players have access to quantum strategies there is
no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, however, there is a Nash equilibrium in
quantum mixed strategies that gives the same average payoff as the classical
game.
