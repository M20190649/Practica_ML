Liouville Integrability of the Schroedinger Equation
Canonical coordinates for both the Schroedinger and the nonlinear
Schroedinger equations are introduced, making more transparent their
Hamiltonian structures. It is shown that the Schroedinger equation, considered
as a classical field theory, shares with the nonlinear Schroedinger, and more
generally with Liouville completely integrable field theories, the existence of
a "recursion operator" which allows for the construction of infinitely many
conserved functionals pairwise commuting with respect to the corresponding
Poisson bracket. The approach may provide a good starting point to get a clear
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics in the general setting, provided by
Stone-von Neumann theorem, of Symplectic Mechanics. It may give new tools to
solve in the general case the inverse problem of Quantum Mechanics.
