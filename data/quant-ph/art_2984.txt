Coherent information analysis of quantum channels in simple quantum
  systems
The coherent information concept is used to analyze a variety of simple
quantum systems. Coherent information was calculated for the information decay
in a two-level atom in the presence of an external resonant field, for the
information exchange between two coupled two-level atoms, and for the
information transfer from a two-level atom to another atom and to a photon
field. The coherent information is shown to be equal to zero for all
full-measurement procedures, but it completely retains its original value for
quantum duplication. Transmission of information from one open subsystem to
another one in the entire closed system is analyzed to learn quantum
information about the forbidden atomic transition via a dipole active
transition of the same atom. It is argued that coherent information can be used
effectively to quantify the information channels in physical systems where
quantum coherence plays an important role.
