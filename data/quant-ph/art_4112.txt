Kronecker product/Direct product/Tensor product in Quantum Information
  theory
The properties and applications of kronecker product in quantum theory is
studied thoroughly. The use of kronecker product in quantum information theory
to get the exact spin Hamiltonian is given. The proof of non-commutativity of
matrices, when kronecker product is used between them is given. It is shown
that the non-commutative matrices after kronecker product are similar or they
are similar matrices.
