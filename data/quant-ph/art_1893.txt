Defending Time-Symmetrized Quantum Counterfactuals
Recently, several authors have criticized the time-symmetrized quantum theory
originated by the work of Aharonov et al. (1964). The core of this criticism
was a proof, appearing in various forms, which showed that the counterfactual
interpretation of time-symmetrized quantum theory cannot be reconciled with
standard quantum theory. I, (Vaidman, 1996a, 1997) have argued that the
apparent contradiction is due to a logical error and introduced consistent
time-symmetrized quantum counterfactuals. Here I repeat my arguments defending
the time-symmetrized quantum theory and reply to the criticism of these
arguments by Kastner (1999).
