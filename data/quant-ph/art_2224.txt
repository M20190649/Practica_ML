The Standard Model in Strong Fields: Electroweak Radiative Corrections
  for Highly Charged Ions
Electroweak radiative corrections to the matrix elements $<ns_{1/2}|{\hat
H}_{PNC}|n'p_{1/2}>$ are calculated for highly charged hydrogenlike ions. These
matrix elements constitute the basis for the description of the most parity
nonconserving (PNC) processes in atomic physics. The operator ${\hat H}_{PNC}$
represents the parity nonconserving relativistic effective atomic Hamiltonian
at the tree level. The deviation of these calculations from the calculations
valid for the momentum transfer $q^{2}=0$ demonstrates the effect of the strong
field, characterized by the momentum transfer $q^{2}=m_{e}^{2}$ ($m_{e}$ is the
electron mass). This allows for a test of the Standard Model in the presence of
strong fields in experiments with highly charged ions.
