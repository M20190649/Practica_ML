The Anomalous Behaviour of Fermions in a Thin Wire
Motivated by the recent development of insulated nano-tubes and the attempts
to develop conducting nano wires in such tubes, we examine the Fermionic
behaviour in extremely thin wires. Although the one- dimensional problem has
been studied in detail over the years, it is an extreme idealization: We
consider the more realistic scenario of thin wires which are nevertheless three
dimensional. We show that the assembly of Fermions behaves as if it is below
the Fermi temperature, and in the limit of one dimension, in the ground state
as well. Thus there are indeed Bosonization features. These conclusions are
checked from an independent stand point.
