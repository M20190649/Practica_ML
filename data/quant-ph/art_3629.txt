A Rosetta Stone for Quantum Mechanics with an Introduction to Quantum
  Computation
The purpose of these lecture notes is to provide readers, who have some
mathematical background but little or no exposure to quantum mechanics and
quantum computation, with enough material to begin reading the research
literature in quantum computation and quantum information theory. This paper is
a written version of the first of eight one hour lectures given in the American
Mathematical Society (AMS) Short Course on Quantum Computation held in
conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the AMS in Washington, DC, USA in
January 2000, and will appear in the AMS PSAPM volume entitled "Quantum
Computation."
  Part 1 of the paper is an introduction the to the concept of the qubit.
  Part 2 gives an introduction to quantum mechanics covering such topics as
Dirac notation, quantum measurement, Heisenberg uncertainty, Schrodinger's
equation, density operators, partial trace, multipartite quantum systems, the
Heisenberg versus the Schrodinger picture, quantum entanglement, EPR paradox,
quantum entropy.
  Part 3 gives a brief introduction to quantum computation, covering such
topics as elementary quantum computing devices, wiring diagrams, the no-cloning
theorem, quantum teleportation, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm.
  Many examples are given. A table of contents as well as an index are provided
for readers who wish to "pick and choose." Since this paper is intended for a
diverse audience, it is written in an informal style at varying levels of
difficulty and sophistication from the very elementary to the more advanced.
