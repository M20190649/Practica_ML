Quantum Copying: Beyond the No-Cloning Theorem
We analyze to what extent it is possible to copy arbitrary states of a
two-level quantum system. We show that there exists a "universal quantum
copying machine", which approximately copies quantum mechanical states in such
a way that the quality of its output does not depend on the input. We also
examine a machine which combines a unitary transformation with a selective
measurement to produce good copies of states in a neighborhood of a particular
state. We discuss the problem of measurement of the output states.
