Optimal Evaluation of Generalized Euler Angles with Applications to
  Classical and Quantum Control
Given two linearly independent matrices in $so(3)$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, every
rotation matrix $X_f \in SO(3)$ can be written as the product of alternate
elements from the one dimensional subgroups corresponding to $Z_1$ and $Z_2$,
namely $X_f=e^{Z_1 t_1}e^{Z_2 t_2}e^{Z_1t_3} \cdot \cdot \cdot e^{Z_1t_s}$. The
parameters $t_i$, $i=1,...,s$ are called {\it generalized Euler angles}.
  In this paper, we evaluate the minimum number of factors required for the
factorization of $X_f \in SO(3)$, as a function of $X_f$, and provide an
algorithm to determine the generalized Euler angles explicitly. The results can
be applied to the bang bang control with minimum number of switches of some
classical control systems and of two level quantum systems.
