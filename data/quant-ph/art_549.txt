Time-dependent parasupersymmetry in quantum mechanics
Parasupersymmetry of the one dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation is established. It is intimately connected with a chain of the
time-dependent Darboux transformations. As an example a parasupersymmetric
model of nonrelativistic free particle with threefold degenerate discrete
spectrum of an integral of motion is constructed.
