The Rigged Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics and its
  Implications for Irreversibility
Quantum mechanics in the Rigged Hilbert Space formulation describes
quasistationary phenomena mathematically rigorously in terms of Gamow vectors.
We show that these vectors exhibit microphysical irreversibility, related to an
intrinsic quantum mechanical arrow of time, which states that preparation of a
state has to precede the registration of an observable in this state. Moreover,
the Rigged Hilbert Space formalism allows the derivation of an exact golden
rule describing the transition of a pure Gamow state into a mixture of
interaction-free decay products.
