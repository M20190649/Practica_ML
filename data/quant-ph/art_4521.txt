Nonsequential positive-operator-valued measurements on entangled mixed
  states do not always violate a Bell inequality
We present a local-hidden-variable model for positive-operator-valued
measurements (an LHVPOV model) on a class of entangled generalized Werner
states, thus demonstrating that such measurements do not always violate a
Bell-type inequality. We also show that, in general, if the state $\rho'$ can
be obtained from $\rho$ with certainty by local quantum operations without
classical communication then an LHVPOV model for the state $\rho$ implies the
existence of such a model for $\rho'$.
