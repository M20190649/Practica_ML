Teleportation of a Zero-and One-photon Running Wave State by Projection
  Synthesis
We show how to teleport a running wave superposition of zero- and one-photon
field state through the projection synthesis technique. The fidelity of the
scheme is computed taking into account the noise introduced by dissipation and
the efficiency of the detectors. These error sources have been introduced
through a single general relationship between input and output operators.
