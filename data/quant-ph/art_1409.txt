Wave Functions and Energy Terms of the SCHRÃ–dinger Equation with
  Two-Center Coulomb Plus Harmonic Oscillator Potential
Schr\"odinger equation for two center Coulomb plus harmonic oscillator
potential is solved by the method of ethalon equation at large intercenter
separations. Asymptotical expansions for energy term and wave function are
obtained in the analytical form.
