Scattering and intrinsic irreversibility
The formalism of quantum systems with diagonal singularities is applied to
describe scattering processes. Well defined states are obtained for infinite
time, which are related to a ''weak form'' of intrinsic irreversibility. Real
and complex generalized spectral decompositions of the Liouville-Von Neumann
superoperator are computed. The physical meaning of ''Gamov states'' is
discussed.
