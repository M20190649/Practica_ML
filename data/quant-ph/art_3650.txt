Sophisticated quantum search without entanglement
Although entanglement is widely considered to be necessary for quantum
algorithms to improve on classical ones, Lloyd has observed recently that
Grover's quantum search algorithm can be implemented without entanglement, by
replacing multiple particles with a single particle having exponentially many
states. We explain that this maneuver removes entanglement from any quantum
algorithm. But all physical resources must be accounted for to quantify
algorithm complexity, and this scheme typically incurs exponential costs in
some other resource(s). In particular, we demonstrate that a recent
experimental realization requires exponentially increasing precision. There is,
however, a quantum algorithm which searches a `sophisticated' database (not
unlike a Web search engine) with a single query, but which we show does not
require entanglement even for multiparticle implementations.
