Characterizing mixing and measurement in quantum mechanics
What fundamental constraints characterize the relationship between a mixture
$\rho = \sum_i p_i \rho_i$ of quantum states, the states $\rho_i$ being mixed,
and the probabilities $p_i$? What fundamental constraints characterize the
relationship between prior and posterior states in a quantum measurement? In
this paper we show that there are many surprisingly strong constraints on these
mixing and measurement processes that can be expressed simply in terms of the
eigenvalues of the quantum states involved. These constraints capture in a
succinct fashion what it means to say that a quantum measurement acquires
information about the system being measured, and considerably simplify the
proofs of many results about entanglement transformation.
