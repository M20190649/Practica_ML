Proposal for measurment of harmonic oscillator Berry phase in ion traps
We propose a scheme for measuring the Berry phase in the vibrational degree
of freedom of a trapped ion. Starting from the ion in a vibrational coherent
state we show how to reverse the sign of the coherent state amplitude by using
a purely geometric phase. This can then be detected through the internal
degrees of freedom of the ion. Our method can be applied to preparation of
Schr\"odinger cat states.
