Decoherence in the Dirac equation
A Dirac particle is represented by a unitarily evolving state vector in a
Hilbert space which factors as $H_{spin} \otimes H_{position}$. Motivated by
the similarity to simple models of decoherence consisting of a two state system
coupled to an environment, we investigate the occurence of decoherence in the
Dirac equation upon tracing over position. We conclude that the physics of this
mathematically exact model for decoherence is closely related to
Zitterbewegung.
