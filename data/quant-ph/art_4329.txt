Real measurements and Quantum Zeno effect
In 1977, Mishra and Sudarshan showed that an unstable particle would never be
found decayed while it was continuously observed. They called this effect the
quantum Zeno effect (or paradox). Later it was realized that the frequent
measurements could also accelerate the decay (quantum anti-Zeno effect). In
this paper we investigate the quantum Zeno effect using the definite model of
the measurement. We take into account the finite duration and the finite
accuracy of the measurement. A general equation for the jump probability during
the measurement is derived. We find that the measurements can cause inhibition
(quantum Zeno effect) or acceleration (quantum anti-Zeno effect) of the
evolution, depending on the strength of the interaction with the measuring
device and on the properties of the system. However, the evolution cannot be
fully stopped.
