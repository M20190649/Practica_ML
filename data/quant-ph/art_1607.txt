What is in One: Uncertainty quantum and Continuum Hypothesis
The concept of measurement is discussed. It is argued that counting process
in mathematics is also measurement which requires a basic unit. The idea of
scale is put forward. The basic unit itself, which are composed of the
infinitesimal of uncertainty quantum, can be regarded as infinite in another
scale. Thus infinite, infinitesimal and integer " 1 " are unified. It is
proposed that multiplication changes to summation when it is transformed to a
larger scale. The Continuum Hypothesis is proved to be correct after a scale
transformation.
