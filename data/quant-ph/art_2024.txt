On the importance of the Bohmian approach for interpreting CP-violation
  experiments
We argue that the inference of CP violation in experiments involving the
$K^0-\bar{K^0}$ system in weak interactions of particle physics is facilitated
by the assumption of particle trajectories for the decaying particles and the
decay products. A consistent explanation in terms of such trajectories is
naturally incorporated within the Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics.
