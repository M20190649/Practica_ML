Non-local quantum evolution of entangled ensemble states in neural nets
  and its significance for brain function and a theory of consciousness
Current quantum theories of consciousness suggest a configuration space of an
entangled ensemble state as global work space for conscious experience. This
study will describe a procedure for adjustment of the singlet evolution of a
quantum computation to a classical signal input by action potentials. The
computational output of an entangled state in a single neuron will be selected
in a network environment by "survival of the fittest" coupling with other
neurons. Darwinian evolution of this coupling will result in a binding of
action potentials to a convoluted orbit of phase-locked oscillations with
harmonic, m-adic, or fractal periodicity. Progressive integration of signal
inputs will evolve a present memory space independent from the history of
construction. Implications for mental processes, e.g., associative memory,
creativity, and consciousness will be discussed. A model for the generation of
quantum coherence in a single neuron will be suggested.
