Universal simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics for qudits
What interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a
composite quantum system? Dodd et al. (quant-ph/0106064) provided a partial
solution to this problem in the form of an efficient algorithm to simulate any
desired two-body Hamiltonian evolution using any fixed two-body entangling
N-qubit Hamiltonian, and local unitaries. We extend this result to the case
where the component systems have D dimensions. As a consequence we explain how
universal quantum computation can be performed with any fixed two-body
entangling N-qudit Hamiltonian, and local unitaries.
