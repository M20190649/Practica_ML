Statistical Inference, Distinguishability of Quantum States, And Quantum
  Entanglement
We argue from the point of view of statistical inference that the quantum
relative entropy is a good measure for distinguishing between two quantum
states (or two classes of quantum states) described by density matrices. We
extend this notion to describe the amount of entanglement between two quantum
systems from a statistical point of view. Our measure is independent of the
number of entangled systems and their dimensionality.
