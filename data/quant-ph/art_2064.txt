Multi-particle entanglement and its applications to cryptography
Entanglement between three or more parties exhibits a realm of properties
unknown to two-party states. Bipartite states are easily classified using the
Schmidt decomposition. The Schmidt coefficients of a bipartite pure state
encompass all the non-local properties of the state and can be "seen" by
looking at one party's density matrix only.
  Pure states of three and more parties however lack such a simple form. They
have more invariants under local unitary transformations than any one party can
"see" on their sub-system. These "hidden non-localities" will allow us to
exhibit a class of multipartite states that cannot be distinguished from each
other by any party. Generalizing a result of BPRST and using a recent result by
Nielsen we will show that these states cannot be transformed into each other by
local actions and classical communication. Furthermore we will use an
orthogonal subset of such states to hint at applications to cryptography and
illustrate an extension to quantum secret sharing (using recently suggested
((n,k))-threshold schemes).
