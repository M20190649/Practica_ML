Resonance Fluorescence Spectrum of a Trapped Ion Undergoing Quantum
  Jumps
We experimentally investigate the resonance fluorescence spectrum of single
171Yb and 172Yb ions which are laser cooled to the Lamb-Dicke regime in a
radiofrequency trap. While the fluorescence scattering of 172Yb is continuous,
the 171Yb fluorescence is interrupted by quantum jumps because a nonvanishing
rate of spontaneous transitions leads to electron shelving in the metastable
hyperfine sublevel 2D3/2(F=2). The average duration of the resulting dark
periods can be varied by changing the intensity of a repumping laser field.
Optical heterodyne detection is employed to analyze the fluorescence spectrum
near the Rayleigh elastic scattering peak. It is found that the stochastic
modulation of the fluorescence emission by quantum jumps gives rise to a
Lorentzian component in the fluorescence spectrum, and that the linewidth of
this component varies according to the average duration of the dark
fluorescence periods. The experimental observations are in quantitative
agreement with theoretical predictions.
