Nearly ideal binary communication in squeezed channels
We analyze the effect of squeezing the channel in binary communication based
on Gaussian states. We show that for coding on pure states, squeezing increases
the detection probability at fixed size of the strategy, actually saturating
the optimal bound already for moderate signal energy. Using Neyman-Pearson
lemma for fuzzy hypothesis testing we are able to analyze also the case of
mixed states, and to find the optimal amount of squeezing that can be
effectively employed. It results that optimally squeezed channels are robust
against signal-mixing, and largely improve the strategy power by comparison
with coherent ones.
