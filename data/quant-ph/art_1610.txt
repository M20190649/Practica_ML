Exactness of Conventional and Supersymmetric JWKB Formulae and Glo bal
  Symmetries of Stokes Graphs
It has been shown that the cases of the JWKB formulae in 1--dim QM quantizing
the energy levels exactly are results of essentially one global symmetry of
both potentials and their corresponding Stokes graphs. Namely, this is the
invariance of the latter on translations in the complex plain of the space
variable i.e. the potentials and the Stokes graphs have to be periodic. A
proliferation of turning points in the basic period strips (parallelograms) is
another limitation for the exactness of the JWKB formulae. A systematic
analyses of a single-well class of potentials satisfying suitable conditions
has been performed. Only ten potentials (with one or two real parameters)
quantized exactly by the JWKB formulae have been found all of them coinciding
(or being equivalent to) with the well-known ones found previously. It was
shown also that the exactness of the supersymmetric JWKB formulae is a
consequence of the corresponding exactness of the conventional ones and vice
versa. Because of the latter two exactly JWKB quantized potentials have been
additionally established. These results show that the exact SUSY JWKB formulae
choose the Comtet at al form of them independently of whether the supersymmetry
is broken or not. A close relation between the shape invariance property of
potentials considered and their meromorphic structure on the x-plane is also
demonstrated.
