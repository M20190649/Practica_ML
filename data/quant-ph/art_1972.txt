Interplay of creation, propagation, and relaxation of an excitation in a
  dimer
Interplay of simultaneous creation, annihilation, propagation, and relaxation
of an excitation in molecular condensates interacting with an ultrashort
quantum optical pulse is studied in general and specialized to a dimer. A
microscopic model appropriate for such systems (with strong exciton-phonon
coupling) is presented. It also incorporates effects of (quantum) noise in the
optical field. A variety of new features in the initial stage of excitation
dynamics (when it is being created) is revealed; a strong influence of the
coherent excitation propagation on the processes of excitation creation and
annihilation in a molecule strongly interacting with phonons is the most
remarkable one.
