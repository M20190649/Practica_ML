Controllability of quantum mechanical systems by root space
  decomposition of su(N)
The controllability property of the unitary propagator of an N-level quantum
mechanical system subject to a single control field is described using the
structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras. Sufficient conditions are provided
for the vector fields in a generic configuration as well as in a few degenerate
cases.
