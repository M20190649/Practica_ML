Molecular photon echoes as a signature of vibrational cat states
Quantum interference between two distinct vibrational trajectories induced by
two pulse femtosecond excitation in molecules is shown to result in a photon
echo, providing direct evidence of the cat state superposition of Gaussian
vibrational wavepackets.
