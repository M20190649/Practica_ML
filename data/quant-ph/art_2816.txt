Optimal Measurements of Spin Direction
The accuracy of a measurement of the spin direction of a spin-s particle is
characterised, for arbitrary half-integral s. The disturbance caused by the
measurement is also characterised. The approach is based on that taken in
several previous papers concerning joint measurements of position and momentum.
As in those papers, a distinction is made between the errors of retrodiction
and prediction. Retrodictive and predictive error relationships are derived.
The POVM describing the outcome of a maximally accurate measurement process is
investigated. It is shown that, if the measurement is retrodictively optimal,
then the distribution of measured values is given by the initial state SU(2)
Q-function. If the measurement is predictively optimal, then the distribution
of measured values is related to the final state SU(2) P-function. The general
form of the unitary evolution operator producing an optimal measurement is
characterised.
