Bose-Einstein Partition Statistics of Photons Emitted from a
  Superradiant Active Microcavity
We report the results of the first investigation on the superradiant temporal
and spatial quantum dynamics of two dipoles excited in a planar symmetrical
microcavity by a controlled femtosecond two-pulse excitation. A superradiant
enhancement of the time decay of the dipole excitation for a decreasing
inter-dipole transverse distance R has been found. Furthermore, the photon
partition statistics of the emitted field is found to exhibit a striking
quantum behaviour for R<lc, the transverse extension of the single allowed
microcavity mode.
