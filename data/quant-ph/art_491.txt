Unitary dynamics for quantum codewords
A quantum codeword is a redundant representation of a logical qubit by means
of several physical qubits. It is constructed in such a way that if one of the
physical qubits is perturbed, for example if it gets entangled with an unknown
environment, there still is enough information encoded in the other physical
qubits to restore the logical qubit, and disentangle it from the environment.
The recovery procedure may consist of the detection of an error syndrome,
followed by the correction of the error, as in the classical case. However, it
can also be performed by means of unitary operations, without having to know
the error syndrome. Since quantum codewords span only a restricted subspace of
the complete physical Hilbert space, the unitary operations that generate
quantum dynamics (that is, the computational process) are subject to
considerable arbitrariness, similar to the gauge freedom in quantum field
theory. Quantum codewords can thus serve as a toy model for investigating the
quantization of constrained dynamical systems.
