Spontaneous decay in the presence of dispersing and absorbing bodies:
  general theory and application to a spherical cavity
A formalism for studying spontaneous decay of an excited two-level atom in
the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies is developed. An
integral equation, which is suitable for numerical solution, is derived for the
atomic upper-state-probability amplitude. The emission pattern and the power
spectrum of the emitted light are expressed in terms of the Green tensor of the
dielectric-matter formation including absorption and dispersion. The theory is
applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom at the center of a
three-layered spherical cavity, with the cavity wall being modeled by a
band-gap dielectric of Lorentz type. Both weak coupling and strong coupling are
studied, the latter with special emphasis on the cases where the atomic
transition is (i) in the normal-dispersion zone near the medium resonance and
(ii) in the anomalous-dispersion zone associated with the band gap. In a
single-resonance approximation, conditions of the appearance of Rabi
oscillations and closed solutions to the evolution of the atomic state
population are derived, which are in good agreement with the exact numerical
results.
