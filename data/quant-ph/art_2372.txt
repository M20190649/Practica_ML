Complete roughness and conductivity corrections for the recent Casimir
  force measurement
We consider detailed roughness and conductivity corrections to the Casimir
force in the recent Casimir force measurement employing an Atomic Force
Microscope. The roughness of the test bodies-a metal plate and a sphere- was
investigated with the Atomic Force Microscope and the Scanning Electron
Microscope respectively. It consists of separate crystals of different heights
and a stochastic background. The amplitude of roughness relative to the zero
roughness level was determined and the corrections to the Casimir force were
calculated up to the fourth order in a small parameter (which is this amplitude
divided by the distance between the two test bodies). Also the corrections due
to finite conductivity were found up to the fourth order in relative
penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point oscillations into the metal.
The theoretical result for the configuration of a sphere above a plate taking
into account both corrections is in excellent agreement with the measured
Casimir force.
