Phase Mapping of Remote Clocks Using Quantum Entanglement
Recently, we have shown how the phase of an electromagnetic field can be
determined by measuring the population of either of the two states of a
two-level atomic system excited by this field, via the so-called Bloch-Siegert
oscillation resulting from the interference between the co- and
counter-rotating excitations. Here, we show how a degenerate entanglement,
created without transmitting any timing signal, can be used to teleport this
phase information. This phase-teleportation process may be applied to achieve
absolute phase-mapping of remote clocks.
