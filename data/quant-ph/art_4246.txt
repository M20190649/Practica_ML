Optimal quantum measurements for spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles
Positive operator valued measures (POVMs) are presented that allow an unknown
pure state of a spin-1 particle to be determined with optimal fidelity when 2
to 5 copies of that state are available. Optimal POVMs are also presented for a
spin-3/2 particle when 2 or 3 copies of the unknown state are available.
Although these POVMs are optimal they are not always minimal, indicating that
there is room for improvement.
