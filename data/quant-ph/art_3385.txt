A study of the consistency between noncommutative quantum mechanics and
  Galilean isotropy
A demonstration is given that the simplest model of quantum mechanics
formulated on a plane non-commutative geometry endowed with a Galilean symmetry
group in which the position and linear momentum-variable commutators are first
order in the dynamical variables (and thus constitute a true Lie algebra) is
incompatible with the hypothesis of spacial isotropy.
