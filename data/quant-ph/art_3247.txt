Quantum authentication and key distribution using catalysis
Starting from Barnum's recent proposal to use entanglement and catalysis for
quantum secure identification [quant-ph/9910072], we describe a protocol for
quantum authentication and authenticated quantum key distribution. We argue
that our scheme is secure even in the presence of an eavesdropper who has
complete control over both classical and quantum channels.
