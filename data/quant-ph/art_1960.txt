Narrow resonances with excitation of finite bandwidth field
The effect of the laser linewidth on the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a
two-level atom is revisited. The novel spectral features, such as hole-burning
and dispersive profiles at line centre of the fluorescence spectrum are
predicted when the laser linewidth is much greater than its intensity. The
unique features result from quantum interference between different
dressed-state transition channels.
