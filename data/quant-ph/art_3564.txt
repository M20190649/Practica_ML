Relational Quantum Measurements, Information and State Collapse
The quantum measurement problem considered for measuring system (MS) consist
of measured state S (particle), detector D and information processing device
(observer) O. It's shown that O states selfreference structure results in
principal nonobservability of MS interference terms which discriminate pure and
mixed S states. Such observables restriction permit to construct for MS states
subjective representation (SR) which describes probabilistic evolution for
measurement events observed by $O$ and his subjective information about S
values. SR is dual and nonequivalent to MS Hilbert space $H$ for external
observer $O'$. Due to it SR evolution is compatible with Schrodinger linear MS
evolution observed by $O'$. It's argued that SR evolution corresponds to S
state collapse for individual events observed by $O$.
