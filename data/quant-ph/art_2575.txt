Ground State Quantum Computation
We formulate a novel ground state quantum computation approach that requires
no unitary evolution of qubits in time: the qubits are fixed in stationary
states of the Hamiltonian. This formulation supplies a completely
time-independent approach to realizing quantum computers. We give a concrete
suggestion for a ground state quantum computer involving linked quantum dots.
