Testing temporal Bell inequalities through repeated measurements in
  rf-SQUIDs
Temporal Bell-like inequalities are derived taking into account the influence
of the measurement apparatus on the observed magnetic flux in a rf-SQUID.
Quantum measurement theory is shown to predict violations of these inequalities
only when the flux states corresponding to opposite current senses are not
distinguishable. Thus rf-SQUIDs cannot help to discriminate realism and quantum
mechanics at the macroscopic level.
