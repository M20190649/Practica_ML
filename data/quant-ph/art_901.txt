On the Improvement of Frequency Stardards with Quantum Entanglement
The optimal precision of frequency measurements in the presence of
decoherence is discussed. We analyze different preparations of n two level
systems as well as different measurement procedures. We show that standard
Ramsey spectroscopy on uncorrelated atoms and optimal measurements on maximally
entangled states provide the same resolution. The best resolution is achieved
using partially entangled preparations with a high degree of symmetry.
