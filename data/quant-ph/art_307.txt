The Standard Model of Quantum Measurement Theory: History and
  Applications
The standard model of the quantum theory of measurement is based on an
interaction Hamiltonian in which the observable-to-be-measured is multiplied
with some observable of a probe system. This simple Ansatz has proved extremely
fruitful in the development of the foundations of quantum mechanics. While the
ensuing type of models has often been argued to be rather artificial, recent
advances in quantum optics have demonstrated their prinicpal and practical
feasibility. A brief historical review of the standard model together with an
outline of its virtues and limitations are presented as an illustration of the
mutual inspiration that has always taken place between foundational and
experimental research in quantum physics.
