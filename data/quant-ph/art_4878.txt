Diffraction of complex molecules by structures made of light
We demonstrate that structures made of light can be used to coherently
control the motion of complex molecules. In particular, we show diffraction of
the fullerenes C60 and C70 at a thin grating based on a standing light wave. We
prove experimentally that the principles of this effect, well known from atom
optics, can be successfully extended to massive and large molecules which are
internally in a thermodynamic mixed state and which do not exhibit narrow
optical resonances. Our results will be important for the observation of
quantum interference with even larger and more complex objects.
