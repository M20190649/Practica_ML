Slow light propagation in trapped atomic quantum gases
We study semi-classical slow light propagation in trapped two level atomic
quantum gases. The temperature dependent behaviors of both group velocity and
transmissions are compared for low temperature Bose, Fermi, and Boltzman gases
within the local density approximation for their spatial density profile.
