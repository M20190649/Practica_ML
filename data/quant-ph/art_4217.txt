Mermin's pentagram and Bell's theorem
It is shown how a proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem given by
Kernaghan and Peres can be experimentally realized using a scheme of
measurements derived from a related proof of the same theorem by Mermin. It is
also pointed out that if this BKS experiment is carried out independently by
two distant observers who repeatedly make measurements on a specially
correlated state of six qubits, it provides an inequality-free demonstration of
Bell's theorem as well.
