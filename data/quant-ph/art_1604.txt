Quantum Robots Plus Environments
A quantum robot is a mobile quantum system including an on bord quantum
computer and ancillary systems, that interact with an environment of quantum
systems. Quantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include carrying out
measurements and physical experiments on the environment. Environments
considered so far in the literature: oracles, data bases, and quantum
registers, are shown to be special cases of environments considered here. It is
noted that quantum robots should include a quantum computer and cannot be
simply a multistate head. A model is discussed in which each task, as a
sequence of computation and action phases, is described by a unitary step
operator. Overall system dynamics is described in terms of a Feynman sum over
paths of completed computation and action phases. A simple task example,
measuring the distance between the quantum robot and a particle on a 1D space
lattice, with quantum phase path and time duration dispersion present, is
analyzed.
