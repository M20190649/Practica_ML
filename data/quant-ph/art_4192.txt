Weak Quantum Theory: Complementarity and Entanglement in Physics and
  Beyond
The concepts of complementarity and entanglement are considered with respect
to their significance in and beyond physics. A formally generalized, weak
version of quantum theory, more general than ordinary quantum theory of
material systems, is outlined and tentatively applied to some examples.
