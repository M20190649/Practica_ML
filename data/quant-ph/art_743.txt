Continuous Fuzzy Measurement of Energy for a Two-Level System
A continuous measurement of energy which is sharp (perfect) leads to the
quantum Zeno effect (freezing of the state). Only if the quantum measurement is
fuzzy, continuous monitoring gives a readout E(t) from which information about
the dynamical development of the state vector of the system may be obtained in
certain cases. This is studied in detail. Fuzziness is thereby introduced with
the help of restricted path integrals equivalent to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
For an otherwise undisturbed multilevel system it is shown that this
measurement represents a model of decoherence. If it lasts long enough, the
measurement readout discriminates between the energy levels and the von Neumann
state reduction is obtained. For a two-level system under resonance influence
(which undergoes in absence of measurement Rabi oscillations between the
levels) different regimes of measurement are specified depending on its
duration and fuzziness: 1) the Zeno regime where the measurement results in a
freezing of the transitions between the levels and 2) the Rabi regime when the
transitions maintain. It is shown that in the Rabi regime at the border to the
Zeno regime a correlation exists between the time dependent measurement readout
and the modified Rabi oscillations of the state of the measured system.
Possible realizations of continuous fuzzy measurements of energy are sketched.
