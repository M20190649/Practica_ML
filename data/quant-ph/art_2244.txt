Modifying the lifetime of an unstable system by an intense
  electromagnetic field
We study the temporal behavior of a three-level system (such as an atom or a
molecule), initially prepared in an excited state, bathed in a laser field
tuned at the transition frequency of the other level. We analyze the dependence
of the lifetime of the initial state on the intensity of the laser field. The
phenomenon we discuss is related to both electromagnetic induced transparency
and quantum Zeno effect.
