Spin-Space Entanglement Transfer and Quantum Statistics
Both the topics of entanglement and particle statistics have aroused enormous
research interest since the advent of quantum mechanics. Using two pairs of
entangled particles we show that indistinguishability enforces a transfer of
entanglement from the internal to the spatial degrees of freedom without any
interaction between these degrees of freedom. Moreover, sub-ensembles selected
by local measurements of the path will in general have different amounts of
entanglement in the internal degrees of freedom depending on the statistics
(either fermionic or bosonic) of the particles involved.
