Classical states via decoherence
The initial states which minimize the predictability loss for a damped
harmonic oscillator are identified as quasi-free states with a symmetry
dictated by the environment's diffusion coefficients. For an isotropic
diffusion in phase space, coherent states (or mixtures of coherent states) are
selected as the most stable ones.
