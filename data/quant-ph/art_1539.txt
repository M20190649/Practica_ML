Theory of atomic diffraction from evanescent waves
We review recent theoretical models and experiments dealing with the
diffraction of neutral atoms from a reflection grating, formed by a standing
evanescent wave. We analyze diffraction mechanisms proposed for normal and
grazing incidence, point out their scopes and confront the theory with
experiment.
