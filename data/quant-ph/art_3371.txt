Bell's inequalities III. Logical loophole in their formulation
In a remarkably insightful pair of papers recently, Sica demonstrated that:
dichotomic data taken in any experiment that violates Bell's inequalities
``cannot represent any data streams that could possibly exist or be imagined''
if it is to be consistent with the derivation of the inequalities.\cite{sica}
The present writer maintains, however, that corrections in the formulation of
Bell's analysis loosen restrictions imposed by Bell inequalities. Moreover, it
is argued that the resolution proposed by Sica for the conflict arising from
the fact that real data does violate Bell inequalities, namely that the
functional form of the correlations considered by Bell must be amended, is
untenable on physical grounds. Finally, an alternate resolution is proposed.
