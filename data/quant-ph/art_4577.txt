Remote control of restricted sets of operations: Teleportation of Angles
We study the remote implementation of a unitary transformation on a qubit. We
show the existence of non-trivial protocols (i.e., using less resources than
bidirectional state teleportation) which allow the perfect remote
implementation of certain continuous sets of quantum operations. We prove that,
up to a local change of basis, only two subsets exist that can be implemented
remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed
direction $\vec{n}$ and rotations by a fixed angle around an arbitrary
direction lying in a plane orthogonal to $\vec{n}$. The overall classical
information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote
implementation depends on whether it is a priori known to which of the two
teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal
protocol consumes one e-bit of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If
the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while
the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to
Bob but only one from Bob to Alice.
