A Nonlinear $sl(2)$ Dynamics and New Quasiclassical Solutions for a
  Class of Quantum Coupled Systems
Hamiltonians of a wide-spread class of strongly coupled quantum system models
are expressed as nonlinear functions of $sl(2)$ generators. It enables us to
use the $sl(2)$ formalism, in particular, $sl(2)$ generalized coherent states
(GCS) for solving both spectral and evolution tasks. In such a manner, using
standard variational schemes with $sl(2)$ GCS as trial functions we find new
analytical expressions for energy spectra and non-linear evolution equations
for cluster dynamics variables in mean-field approximations which are beyond
quasi-harmonic ones obtained earlier. General results are illustrated on
certain concrete models of quantum optics and laser physics.
