Optimal States for Bell inequality Violations using Quadrature Phase
  Homodyne Measurements
We identify what ideal correlated photon number states are to required to
maximize the discrepancy between local realism and quantum mechanics when a
quadrature homodyne phase measurement is used. Various Bell inequality tests
are considered.
