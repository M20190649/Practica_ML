Protection of information in quantum qatabases
The conventional protection of information by cryptographical keys makes no
sense if a key can be quickly discovered by an unauthorized person. This way of
penetration to the protected systems was made possible by a quantum computers
in view of results of P.Shor and L.Grover. This work presents the method of
protection of an information in a database from a spy even he knows all about
its control system and has a quantum computer, whereas a database can not
distinguish between operations of spy and legal user.
