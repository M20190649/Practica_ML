Quantum Communication Protocol Employing Weak Measurements
We propose a communication protocol exploiting correlations between two
events with a definite time-ordering: a) the outcome of a {\em weak
measurement} on a spin, and b) the outcome of a subsequent ordinary measurement
on the spin. In our protocol, Alice, first generates a "code" by performing
weak measurements on a sample of N spins.
  The sample is sent to Bob, who later performs a post-selection by measuring
the spin along either of two certain directions. The results of the
post-selection define the "key', which he then broadcasts publicly. Using both
her previously generated code and this key, Alice is able to infer the {\em
direction} chosen by Bob in the post-selection. Alternatively, if Alice
broadcasts publicly her code, Bob is able to infer from the code and the key
the direction chosen by Alice for her weak measurement. Two possible
experimental realizations of the protocols are briefly mentioned.
