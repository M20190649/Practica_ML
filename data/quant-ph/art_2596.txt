Transition probabilities between quasifree states
We obtain a general formula for the transition probabilities between any
state of the algebra of the canonical commutation relations (CCR-algebra) and a
squeezed quasifree state. Applications of this formula are made for the case of
multimode thermal squeezed states of quantum optics using a general canonical
decomposition of the correlation matrix valid for any quasifree state. In the
particular case of a one mode CCR-algebra we show that the transition
probability between two quasifree squeezed states is a decreasing function of
the geodesic distance between the points of the upper half plane representing
these states. In the special case of the purification map it is shown that the
transition probability between the state of the enlarged system and the product
state of real and fictitious subsystems can be a measure for the entanglement.
