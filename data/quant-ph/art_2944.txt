Generation of continuous-wave THz radiation by use of quantum
  interference
We propose a scheme for generation of continuous-wave THz radiation. The
scheme requires a medium where three discrete states in a $\Lambda $
configuration can be selected, with the THz-frequency transition between the
two lower metastable states. We consider the propagation of three-frequency
continuous-wave electromagnetic (e.m.) radiation through a $\Lambda $ medium.
Under resonant excitation, the medium absorption can be strongly reduced due to
quantum interference of transitions, while the nonlinear susceptibility is
enhanced. This leads to very efficient energy transfer between the e.m. waves
providing a possibility for THz generation. We demonstrate that the photon
conversion efficiency is approaching unity in this technique.
