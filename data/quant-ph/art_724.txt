Least-squares inversion for density-matrix reconstruction
We propose a method for reconstruction of the density matrix from measurable
time-dependent (probability) distributions of physical quantities. The
applicability of the method based on least-squares inversion is - compared with
other methods - very universal. It can be used to reconstruct quantum states of
various systems, such as harmonic and and anharmonic oscillators including
molecular vibrations in vibronic transitions and damped motion. It also enables
one to take into account various specific features of experiments, such as
limited sets of data and data smearing owing to limited resolution. To
illustrate the method, we consider a Morse oscillator and give a comparison
with other state-reconstruction methods suggested recently.
