Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory VIII: Second Quantization
We continue in this paper our program of rederiving all quantum mechanical
formalism from the classical one. We now turn our attention to the derivation
of the second quantized equations, both for integral and half-integral spins.
We then show that all the quantum results may be derived using our approach and
also show the interpretation suggested by this derivation. This paper may be
considered as a first approach to the study of the quantum field theory
beginning by the same classical ideas we are supporting since the first paper
of this series.
