A stationary source of non-classical or entangled atoms
A scheme for generating continuous beams of atoms in non-classical or
entangled quantum states is proposed and analyzed. For this the recently
suggested transfer technique of quantum states from light fields to collective
atomic excitation by Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage [M.Fleischhauer and
M.D. Lukin, Phys.Rev.Lett. 84, 5094 (2000)] is employed and extended to matter
waves.
