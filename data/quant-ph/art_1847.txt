Realistic theory of microscopic phenomena; a new solution of
  hidden-variable problem
It has been shown that quantum paradoxes have followed from one special
assumption, i.e., from attributing basic physical meaning to Hamiltonian
eigenfunctions and representing all physical states by vectors of the Hilbert
space spanned on these eigenfunctions. However, any paradoxical properties
disappear if the physical states are represented by vectors from the extended
Hilbert space on which the scattering theory of Lax and Phillips has been
based. On the other side, all stationary characteristics and experimentally
verified quantum-mechanical predictions remain the same. The extended
mathematical model is also in full agreement with results of EPR experiments,
if one takes into account that a further assumption (in addition to locality
condition) is involved in derivation of Bell's inequalities as shown recently
(see: quant-ph/9808005).
