Does Quantum Mechanics imply influences acting backward in time in
  impact series experiments?
A real two-particle experiment is proposed in which one of the particles
undergoes two successive impacts on beam-splitters. It is shown that the
standard quantum mechanical superposition principle implies the possibility of
influences acting backward in time ("retrocausation"), in striking contrast
with the principle of causality. It is argued that nonlocality and
retrocausation are not necessarily entangled.
