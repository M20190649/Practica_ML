Reliability function of general classical-quantum channel
In information theory the reliability function and its bounds, describing the
exponential behavior of the error probability, are the most important
quantitative characteristics of the channel performance. From a general point
of view, these bounds provide certain measures of distinguishability of a given
set of states. In an earlier paper we introduced quantum analogs of the random
coding and the expurgation lower bounds for the case of pure signal states.
Here we discuss the general case, in particular, we prove the previously
conjectured expurgation bound and find the quantum cutoff rate in the case of
arbitrary mixed signal states.
