Is Quantization Geometry?
The metric known to be relevant for standard quantization procedures receives
a natural interpretation and its explicit use simultaneously gives both
physical and mathematical meaning to a (coherent-state) phase-space path
integral, and at the same time establishes a fully satisfactory, geometric
procedure of quantization.
