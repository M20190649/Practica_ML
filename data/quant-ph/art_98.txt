Randomness, Nonlocality and information in entagled correlations
It is shown that the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) correlations for
arbitrary spin-s and the Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (GHZ) correlations
for three particles can be described by nonlocal joint and conditional quantum
probabilities. The nonlocality of these probabilities makes the Bell's
inequalities void. A description that exhibits the relation between the
randomness and the nonlocality of entangled correlations is introduced.
Entangled EPR and GHZ correlations are studied using the Gibbs-Shannon entropy.
The nonlocal character of the EPR correlations is tested using the information
Bell's inequalities. Relations between the randomness, the nonlocality and the
entropic information for the EPR and the GHZ correlations are established and
discussed.
