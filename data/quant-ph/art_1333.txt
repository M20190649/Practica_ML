Decoherence from internal degrees of freedom for cluster of
  mesoparticles : a hierarchy of master equations
A mesoscopic evolution equation for an ensemble of mesoparticles follows
after the elimination of internal degrees of freedom. If the system is composed
of a hierarchy of scales, the reduction procedure could be worked repeatedly
and the characterization of this iterating method is carried out. Namely, a
prescription describing a discrete hierarchy of master equations for the
density operator is obtained. Decoherence follows from the irreversible
coupling of the systems, defined by mesoscopic variables, to internal degrees
of freedom. We discuss briefly the existence of systems with the same dynamics
laws at different scales. We made an explicit calculation for an ensemble of
particles with internal harmonic interaction in an external anharmonic field.
New conditions related to the semiclassical limit for mesoscopic systems
(Wigner-function) are conjectured.
