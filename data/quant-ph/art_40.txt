Why Classical Mechanics Cannot Naturally Accommodate Consciousness But
  Quantum Mechanics Can.

classical mechanics is not constitutionally suited to accomodate consciousness,
whereas quantum mechanics is. These mathematical characteristics pertain to the
nature of the information represented in the state of the brain, and the way
this information enters into the dynamics.
