Spin Description and Calculation in the Lande' Interpretation of Quantum
  Mechanics
We explain the connection between the generalized spin quantities we have
recently introduced and standard forms. We show how the calculation of various
quantities of interest using these new forms is done. Focusing attention on
expectation values, we find that in every case, the standard results can be
obtained as special cases arising from the new generalized results.
