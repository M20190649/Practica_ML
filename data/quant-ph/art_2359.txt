Maxwell Duality, Lorentz Invariance, and Topological Phase
We discuss the Maxwell electromagnetic duality relations between the
Aharonov-Bohm, Aharonov-Casher, and He-McKellar-Wilkens topological phases,
which allows a unified description of all three phenomena. We also elucidate
Lorentz transformations that allow these effects to be understood in an
intuitive fashion in the rest frame of the moving quantum particle. Finally, we
propose two experimental schemes for measuring the He-McKellar-Wilkens phase.
