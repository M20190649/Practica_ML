Non-Fock Representations of Heisenberg Algebras
The purpose of this paper is to present the mathematical techniques of a new
quantum scheme using a dual pair of reflexive topological vector spaces in
terms of the non-Hermitian form. The scheme is shown to be a generalization of
the well-known unitary quantum theory and to describe jointly quantum objects
and physical vacuum.
