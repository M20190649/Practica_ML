Dynamical mass shift for a partially reflecting moving mirror
We consider the vacuum fluctuations contribution to the mass of a mirror in
an exactly soluble partially reflecting moving mirror model. Partial
reflectivity is accounted for by a repulsive delta-type potential localized
along the mirror trajectory. The mirror's mass is explicitly found as an
integral functional of the mirror's past trajectory.
