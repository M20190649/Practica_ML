Generation of phase-coherent states
An interaction scheme involving nonlinear $\chi^{(2)}$ media is suggested for
the generation of phase-coherent states (PCS). The setup is based on parametric
amplification of vacuum followed by up-conversion of the resulting twin-beam.
The involved nonlinear interactions are studied by the exact numerical
diagonalization. An experimentally achievable working regime to approximate PCS
with high conversion rate is given, and the validity of parametric
approximation is discussed.
