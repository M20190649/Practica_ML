Hydrodynamical quantum state reconstruction
The density matrix of a nonrelativistic wave-packet in an arbitrary,
one-dimensional and time-dependent potential can be reconstructed by measuring
hydrodynamical moments of the Wigner distribution. An n-th order Taylor
polynomial in the off-diagonal variable is obtained by measuring the
probability distribution at n+1 discrete time values.
