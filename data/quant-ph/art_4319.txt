Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical
Decoherence is caused by the interaction with the environment. Environment
monitors certain observables of the system, destroying interference between the
pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to
environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process
associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are
stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the Universe in spite of
the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective
ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the
flagrantly non-local "Schr\"odinger cat" states. Classical structure of phase
space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic
limit: Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of
a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces
quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the
classical correlation.
