The Non-mechanistic Character of Quantum Computation
The higher than classical efficiency exhibited by some quantum algorithms is
here ascribed to their non-mechanistic character, which becomes evident by
joining the notions of entanglement and quantum measurement. Measurement
analogically sets a (partial) constraint on the output of the computation of a
hard-to-reverse function. This constraint goes back in time along the
reversible computation process, computing the reverse function, which yields
quantum efficiency. The evolution, comprising wave function collapse (here a
revamped notion), is non-mechanistic as it is driven by both an initial
condition and a final constraint. It seems that the more the output is
constrained by measurement, the higher can be the efficiency. Setting a
complete constraint, by means of a special Zeno effect, yields (speculatively)
NP-complete=P.
