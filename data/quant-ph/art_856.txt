An Operational Approach to Quantum State Reduction
An operational approach to quantum state reduction, the state change of the
measured system caused by a measurement of an observable conditional upon the
outcome of measurement, is founded without assuming the projection postulate in
any stages of the measuring process. Whereas the conventional formula assumes
that the probe measurement satisfies the projection postulate, a new formula
for determining the state reduction shows that the state reduction does not
depend on how the probe observable is measured, or in particular does not
depend on whether the probe measurement satisfies the projection postulate or
not, contrary to the longstanding attempts in showing how the macroscopic
nature of probe detection provokes state reduction.
