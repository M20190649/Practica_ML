Skirting Hidden-Variable No-Go Theorems
It is observed that the proofs of hidden-variable no-go theorems depend on
the `projection postulate,' which is seen to be contradictory with respect to
spin operators in directions orthogonal to the magnetic field direction. In
this light it is argued that it is less costly to abandon the projection
postulate than to abandon locality and this in turn renders Hidden-Variable
No-Go Theorems evadible. To buttress this point, a local realist model of the
EPR experiment which ignores the constraints of the projection postulate is
presented.
