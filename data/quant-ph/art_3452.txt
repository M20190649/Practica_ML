Quantum jumps in backaction evasion measurements of a light field
  component
Backaction evasion measurements of a quadrature component of the light field
vacuum necessarily induce quantum jumps in the photon number. The correlation
between measurement results and quantum jump events reveals fundamental
nonclassical aspects of quantization.
