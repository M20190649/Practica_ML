Contextuality of Approximate Measurements
The claim of Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) that finite precision measurement
nullifies the Kochen-Specker theorem is criticised. It is argued that, although
MKC have nullified the Kochen-Specker theorem strictly so-called, there are
other, related propositions which are not nullified. The argument given is an
elaboration of some of Mermin's critical remarks. Although MKC allow for the
fact that the observables to be measured cannot be precisely specified, they
continue to assume that the observables which are actually measured are
strictly commuting. As Mermin points out, this assumption is unjustified.
Consequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs
to investigate the predictions their models make regarding approximate joint
measurements of non-commuting observables. Such an investigation is carried
out, using methods previously developed in connection with approximate joint
measurements of position and momentum. It is shown that a form of contextuality
then re-emerges.
