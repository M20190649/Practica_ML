Universality of Decoherence
We consider environment induced decoherence of quantum superpositions to
mixtures in the limit in which that process is much faster than any competing
one generated by the Hamiltonian $H_{\rm sys}$ of the isolated system. While
the golden rule then does not apply we can discard $H_{\rm sys}$. By allowing
for simultaneous couplings to different reservoirs, we reveal decoherence as a
universal short-time phenomenon independent of the character of the system as
well as the bath and of the basis the superimposed states are taken from. We
discuss consequences for the classical behavior of the macroworld and quantum
measurement: For the decoherence of superpositions of macroscopically distinct
states the system Hamiltonian is always negligible.
