Quantum Wires and Quantum Dots for Neutral Atoms
By placing changeable nanofabricated structures (wires, dots, etc.) on an
atom mirror one can design guiding and trapping potentials for atoms. These
potentials are similar to the electrostatic potentials which trap and guide
electrons in semiconductor quantum devices like quantum wires and quantum dots.
This technique will allow the fabrication of nanoscale atom optical devices.
