Quantum Logical Operations on Encoded Qubits
We show how to carry out quantum logical operations (controlled-not and
Toffoli gates) on encoded qubits for several encodings which protect against
various 1-bit errors. This improves the reliability of these operations by
allowing one to correct for one bit errors which either preexisted or occurred
in course of operation. The logical operations we consider allow one to cary
out the vast majority of the steps in the quantum factoring algorithm. Thus,
our results help bring quantum factoring and other quantum computations closer
to reality
