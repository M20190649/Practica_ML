Quantum Statistical Mechanics on a Quantum Computer
We describe a quantum algorithm to compute the density of states and thermal
equilibrium properties of quantum many-body systems. We present results
obtained by running this algorithm on a software implementation of a 21-qubit
quantum computer for the case of an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on
triangular lattices of different size.
