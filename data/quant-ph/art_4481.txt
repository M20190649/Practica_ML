Lower bounds for quantum communication complexity
We prove new lower bounds for bounded error quantum communication complexity.
Our methods are based on the Fourier transform of the considered functions.
First we generalize a method for proving classical communication complexity
lower bounds developed by Raz to the quantum case. Applying this method we give
an exponential separation between bounded error quantum communication
complexity and nondeterministic quantum communication complexity. We develop
several other lower bound methods based on the Fourier transform, notably
showing that \sqrt{\bar{s}(f)/\log n}, for the average sensitivity \bar{s}(f)
of a function f, yields a lower bound on the bounded error quantum
communication complexity of f(x AND y XOR z), where x is a Boolean word held by
Alice and y,z are Boolean words held by Bob. We then prove the first large
lower bounds on the bounded error quantum communication complexity of
functions, for which a polynomial quantum speedup is possible. For all the
functions we investigate, the only previously applied general lower bound
method based on discrepancy yields bounds that are O(\log n).
