Entanglement of Orbital Angular Momentum States of Photons
So far experimental confirmation of entanglement has been restricted to
qubits, i.e. two-state quantum systems including recent realization of three-
and four-qubit entanglements. Yet, an ever increasing body of theoretical work
calls for entanglement in quantum system of higher dimensions. Here we report
the first realization of multi-dimensional entanglement exploiting the orbital
angular momentum of photons, which are states of the electromagnetic field with
phase singularities (doughnut modes). The properties of such states could be of
importance for the efforts in the field of quantum computation and quantum
communication. For example, quantum cryptography with higher alphabets could
enable one to increase the information flux through the communication channels.
