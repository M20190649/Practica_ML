A Quantum-Theoretic Analog for a Pair of Noncommuting Observables of the
  Semiclassical Brillouin Function
We study, with the use of numerical integration, a noncommutative extension
of a quantum-theoretic model (an alternative to the semiclassical Brillouin
function), recently presented by Brody and Hughston and, independently, Slater,
for the thermodynamic behavior of a spin-1/2 particle. Differences between the
(broadly similar) predictions yielded by this extended model and those obtained
from its conventional (semiclassical/Jaynesian) entropy-maximization
counterpart are examined.
