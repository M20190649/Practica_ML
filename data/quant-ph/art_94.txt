A Universal Two--Bit Gate for Quantum Computation
We prove the existence of a class of two--input, two--output gates any one of
which is universal for quantum computation. This is done by explicitly
constructing the three--bit gate introduced by Deutsch [Proc.~R.~Soc.~London.~A
{\bf 425}, 73 (1989)] as a network consisting of replicas of a single two--bit
gate.
