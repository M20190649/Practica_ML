Upper Bound on the region of Separable States near the Maximally Mixed
  State
A lower bound on the amount of noise that must be added to a GHZ-like
entangled state to make it separable (also called the random robustness) is
found using the transposition condition. The bound is applicable to arbitrary
numbers of subsystems, and dimensions of Hilbert space, and is shown to be
exact for qubits. The new bound is compared to previous such bounds on this
quantity, and found to be stronger in all cases. It implies that increasing the
number of subsystems, rather than increasing their Hilbert space dimension is a
more effective way of increasing entanglement. An explicit decomposition into
an ensemble of separable states, when the state is not entangled,is given for
the case of qubits.
