Quantum-scissors device for optical state truncation: A proposal for
  practical realization
We propose a realizable experimental scheme to prepare superposition of the
vacuum and one-photon states by truncating an input coherent state. The scheme
is based on the quantum scissors device proposed by Pegg, Phillips, and Barnett
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] and uses photon-counting detectors, a
single-photon source, and linear optical elements. Realistic features of the
photon counting and single-photon generation are taken into account and
possible error sources are discussed together with their effect on the fidelity
and efficiency of the truncation process. Wigner function and phase
distribution of the generated states are given and discussed for the evaluation
of the proposed scheme.
