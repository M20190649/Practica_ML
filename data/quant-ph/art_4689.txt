Some Comments On Bound State Eigenvalues of PT-Symmetric Potentials
Using purely physical arguments it is claimed that for ID Schrodinger
operators with complex PT- Symmatric potentials having a purely real attractive
potential well and a purely imaginary repulsive part,bound state eigenvalues
will be discrete and real.This has been illustrated with several potentials
possessing similar properties.
