Quantum Computer Emulator
We describe a quantum computer emulator for a generic, general purpose
quantum computer. This emulator consists of a simulator of the physical
realization of the quantum computer and a graphical user interface to program
and control the simulator. We illustrate the use of the quantum computer
emulator through various implementations of the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover's
database search algorithm.
