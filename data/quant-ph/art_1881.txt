Time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equations having isomorphic symmetry
  algebras. I. Classes of interrelated equations
In this paper, we focus on a general class of Schr\"odinger equations that
are time-dependent and quadratic in X and P. We transform Schr\"odinger
equations in this class, via a class of time-dependent mass equations, to a
class of solvable time-dependent oscillator equations. This transformation
consists of a unitary transformation and a change in the ``time'' variable. We
derive mathematical constraints forthe transformation and introduce two
examples.
