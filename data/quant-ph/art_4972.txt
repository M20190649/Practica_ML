On the Experimental Incompatibility Between Standard and Bohmian Quantum
  Mechanics
Recently, three experiments have been proposed in order to show that the
standard and Bohmian quantum mechanics can have different predictions at the
individual level of particles. However, these thought experiments have
encountered some objections. In this work, it is our purpose to show that our
basic conclusions about those experiments are still intact.
