A non-Markovian quantum trajectory approach to radiation into structured
  continuum
We present a non-Markovian quantum trajectory method for treating atoms
radiating into a reservoir with a non-flat density of states. The results of an
example numerical simulation of the case where the free space modes of the
reservoir are altered by the presence of a cavity are presented and compared
with those of an extended system approach.
