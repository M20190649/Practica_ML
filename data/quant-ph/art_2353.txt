Quantum Tomography Approach in Signal Analysis
Some properties of the fractional Fourier transform, which is used in
information processing, are presented in connection with the tomography
transform of optical signals. Relation of the Green function of the quantum
harmonic oscillator to the fractional Fourier transform is elucidated.
