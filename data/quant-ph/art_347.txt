A Class of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Saturating the Quantum Hamming
  Bound
I develop methods for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes, and use these
methods to construct an infinite class of codes saturating the quantum Hamming
bound. These codes encode $k=n-j-2$ qubits in $n=2^j$ qubits and correct $t=1$
error.
