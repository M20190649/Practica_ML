Generalized Moyal structures in phase space, kinetic equations and their
  classical limit: I. General Formalism
Generalised Wigner and Weyl transformations of quantum operators are defined
and their properties, as well as those of the algebraic structure induced on
the phase-space are studied. Using such transformations, quantum linear
evolution equations are given a phase-space representation. In particular this
is done for the general kinetic equation of the Lindblad type. The resulting
expressions are better suited for the passage to the classical limit and for a
general comparison of classical and quantum systems. In this context a
preliminary discussion of a number of problems of kinetic theory of open
systems is given, whereas explicit applications are made in the next paper of
the series.
