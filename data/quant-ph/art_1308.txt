Monotonicity of the quantum linear programming bound
The most powerful technique known at present for bounding the size of quantum
codes of prescribed minimum distance is the quantum linear programming bound.
Unlike the classical linear programming bound, it is not immediately obvious
that if the quantum linear programming constraints are satisfiable for
dimension K, that the constraints can be satisfied for all lower dimensions. We
show that the quantum linear programming bound is indeed monotonic in this
sense, and give an explicitly monotonic reformulation.
