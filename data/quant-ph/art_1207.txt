Resolved-sideband Raman cooling to the ground state of an optical
  lattice
We trap neutral Cs atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice and cool them
close to the zero-point of motion by resolved-sideband Raman cooling. Sideband
cooling occurs via transitions between the vibrational manifolds associated
with a pair of magnetic sublevels and the required Raman coupling is provided
by the lattice potential itself. We obtain mean vibrational excitations
\bar{n}_x \approx \bar{n}_y \approx 0.01, corresponding to a population \sim
98% in the vibrational ground state. Atoms in the ground state of an optical
lattice provide a new system in which to explore quantum state control and
