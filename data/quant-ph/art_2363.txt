Phase matching in quantum searching
Each iteration in Grover's original quantum search algorithm contains 4
steps: two Hadamard-Walsh transformations and two amplitudes inversions. When
the inversion of the marked state is replaced by arbitrary phase rotation
\theta and the inversion for the prepared state |\gamma> is replaced by
rotation through \phi, we found that these phase rotations must satisfy a
matching condition \theta=\phi. Approximate formula for the amplitude of the
marked state after an arbitrary number of iterations are also derived. We give
also a simple explanation of the phase matching requirement.
