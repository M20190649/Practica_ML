Quantum Zeno effect in a probed downconversion process
The distorsion of a spontaneous downconvertion process caused by an auxiliary
mode coupled to the idler wave is analyzed. In general, a strong coupling with
the auxiliary mode tends to hinder the downconversion in the nonlinear medium.
On the other hand, provided that the evolution is disturbed by the presence of
a phase mismatch, the coupling may increase the speed of downconversion. These
effects are interpreted as being manifestations of quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno
effects, respectively, and they are understood by using the dressed modes
picture of the device. The possibility of using the coupling as a nontrivial
phase--matching technique is pointed out.
