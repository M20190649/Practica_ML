Complete Separability and Fourier representations of n-qubit states
Necessary conditions for separability are most easily expressed in the
computational basis, while sufficient conditions are most conveniently
expressed in the spin basis. We use the Hadamard matrix to define the
relationship between these two bases and to emphasize its interpretation as a
Fourier transform. We then prove a general sufficient condition for complete
separability in terms of the spin coefficients and give necessary and
sufficient conditions for the complete separability of a class of generalized
Werner densities. As a further application of the theory, we give necessary and
sufficient conditions for full separability for a particular set of $n$-qubit
states whose densities all satisfy the Peres condition.
