Optimal signal ensembles
Classical messages can be sent via a noisy quantum channel in various ways,
corresponding to various choices of signal states of the channel. Previous work
by Holevo and by Schumacher and Westmoreland relates the capacity of the
channel to the properties of the signal ensemble. Here we describe some
properties characterizing the ensemble that maximizes the capacity, using the
relative entropy "distance" between density operators to give the results a
geometric flavor.
