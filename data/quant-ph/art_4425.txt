Interaction representation method for Markov master equations in quantum
  optics
Conditions sufficient for a quantum dynamical semigroup (QDS) to be unital
are proved for a class of problems in quantum optics with Hamiltonians which
are self-adjoint polynomials of any finite order in creation and annihilation
operators. The order of the Hamiltonian may be higher than the order of
completely positive part of the formal generator of a QDS.
  The unital property of a minimal quantum dynamical semigroup implies the
uniqueness of the solution of the corresponding Markov master equation in the
class of quantum dynamical semigroups and, in the corresponding representation,
it ensures preservation of the trace or unit operator. We recall that only in
the unital case the formal generator of MME determines uniquely the
corresponding QDS.
