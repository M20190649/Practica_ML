Quantum Theory : A Pointer To An Independent Reality
While philosophy of science is the study of problems of knowledge concerning
science in general, there also exists - or should exist - a '' philosophy in
science'' directed at finding out in what ways our actual scientific knowledge
may validly contribute to the basic philosophical quest. Contrary to philosophy
of science, which is a subject for philosophers, philosophy in science calls on
the services of physicists. When, in its spirit, quantum theory and Bell's
theorem are used as touchstones, the two main traditional philosophical
approaches, realism and idealism, are found wanting. A more suitable conception
seems to be an intermediate one, in which the mere postulated existence of a
holistic and hardly knowable Mind-Independent Reality is found to have an
explaining power. Some corrections to comments by Schins of a previous work on
the same subject are incorporated.
