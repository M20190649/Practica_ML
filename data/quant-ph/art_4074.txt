Requirement of optical coherence for continuous-variable quantum
  teleportation
We show that the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) each require coherent
devices in order to achieve unconditional continuous variable quantum
teleportation (CVQT), and this requirement cannot be achieved with conventional
laser sources, even in principle. The appearance of successful CVQT in recent
experiments is due to interpreting the measurement record fallaciously in terms
of one preferred ensemble (or decomposition) of the correct density matrix
describing the state. Our analysis is unrelated to technical problems such as
laser phase drift or finite squeezing bandwidth.
