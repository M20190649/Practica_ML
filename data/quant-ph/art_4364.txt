Quantum Zeno phenomena: pulsed versus continuous measurement
The time evolution of an unstable quantum mechanical system coupled with an
external measuring agent is investigated. According to the features of the
interaction Hamiltonian, a quantum Zeno effect (hindered decay) or an inverse
quantum Zeno effect (accelerated decay) can take place, depending on the
response time of the apparatus. The transition between the two regimes is
analyzed for both pulsed and continuous measurements.
