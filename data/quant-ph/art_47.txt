Deformation of Partical Distribution Functions due to Q-nonlinearity and
  Nonstationary Casimir Effect
The geometrical phase is shown to be integral of motion. Deformation of
particle distribution function corresponding to nonstationary Casimir effect is
expressed in terms of multivariable Hermite polynomials. Correction to Planck
distribution due to q--nonlinearity is discussed.
