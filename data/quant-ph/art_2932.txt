A defense of Hellwig-Kraus reductions
Aharonov and Albert analyze a thought experiment which they believe shows
that quantum mechanical state reductions occur along temporal hypersurfaces in
Minkowski space. They conclude that the covariant state reduction theory of
Hellwig and Kraus does not apply. In Part I of this paper we disagree with this
interpretation of the A-A experiment, and show the adequacy of the H-K theory.
In Part II we examine the belief that H-K reductions produce self contradicting
causal loops, and/or give rise to absurd boundary conditions. These objections
to the theory are shown to be unfounded.
