Klein paradox and antiparticle
The Klein paradox of Klein-Gordon (KG) equation is discussed to show that KG
equation is self-consistent even at one-particle level and the wave function
for antiparticle is uniquely determined by the reasonable explanation of Klein
paradox. No concept of ``hole'' is needed.
