Quantum gates with "hot" trapped ions
We propose a scheme to perform a fundamental two-qubit gate between two
trapped ions using ideas from atom interferometry. As opposed to the scheme
considered by J. I. Cirac and P. Zoller, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 4091 (1995), it
does not require laser cooling to the motional ground state.
