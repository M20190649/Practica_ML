About the Notion of Truth in the Decoherent Histories Approach: a reply
  to Griffiths
Griffiths claims that the ``single family rule'', a basic postulate of the
decoherent histories approach, rules out our requirement that any decoherent
history has a unique truth value, independently from the decoherent family to
which it may belong. Here we analyze the reasons which make our requirement
indispensable and we discuss the consequences of rejecting it.
