Strong excitations of a Bose--Einstein condensate: Barrier resonances
We study the dynamics of a forced condensed atom cloud and relate the
behavior to a classical Mathieu oscillator in a singular potential. It is found
that there are wide resonances which can strongly affect the dynamics even when
dissipation is present. The behavior is characteristic of condensed clouds of
any shape and has experimental relevance.
