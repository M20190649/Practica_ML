Homodyne detection for measuring coherent phase state distributions
Using coherent phase states, parameterized phase state distributions for a
single-mode radiation field are introduced and their integral relation to the
phase-parameterized field-strength distributions is studied. The integral
kernel is evaluated and the problem of direct sampling of the coherent phase
state distributions using balanced homodyne detection is considered. Numerical
simulations show that when the value of the smoothing parameter is not too
small the coherent phase state distributions can be obtained with sufficiently
well accuracy. With decreasing value of the smoothing parameter the
determination of the coherent phase state distributions may be an effort,
because both the numerical calculation of the sampling function and the
measurement of the field-strength distributions are required to be performed
with drastically increasing accuracy.
