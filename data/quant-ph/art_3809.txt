Decoherence, pointer engineering and quantum state protection
We present a proposal for protecting states against decoherence, based on the
engineering of pointer states. We apply this procedure to the vibrational
motion of a trapped ion, and show how to protect qubits, squeezed states,
approximate phase eigenstates and superpositions of coherent states.
