Progress in a Many-Minds Interpretation of Quantum Theory
In a series of papers, a many-minds interpretation of quantum theory has been
developed. The aim in these papers is to present an explicit mathematical
formalism which constitutes a complete theory compatible with relativistic
quantum field theory. In this paper, which could also serve as an introduction
to the earlier papers, three issues are discussed. First, a significant, but
fairly straightforward, revision in some of the technical details is proposed.
This is used as an opportunity to introduce the formalism. Then the
probabilistic structure of the theory is revised, and it is proposed that the
experience of an individual observer can be modelled as the experience of
observing a particular, identified, discrete stochastic process. Finally, it is
argued that the formalism can be modified to give a physics in which no
constants are required. Instead, `constants' have to be determined by
observation, and are fixed only to the extent to which they have been observed.
