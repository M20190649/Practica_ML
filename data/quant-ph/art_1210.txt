Coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle
The coherent states for the quantum particle on the circle are introduced.
The Bargmann representation within the actual treatment provides the
representation of the algebra $[\hat J,U]=U$, where $U$ is unitary, which is a
direct consequence of the Heisenberg algebra $[\hat \phi, \hat J]=i$, but it is
more adequate for the study of the circlular motion.
