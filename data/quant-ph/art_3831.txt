Optical tests of quantum nonlocality: from EPR-Bell tests towards
  experiments with moving observers
Past, present and future experimental tests of quantum nonlocality are
discussed. Consequences of assuming that the state-vector collapse is a real
physical phenomenon in space-time are developed. These lead to experiments
feasible with today's technology.
