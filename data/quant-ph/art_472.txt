Transformation Properties of Classical and Quantum Laws under Some
  Nonholonomic Spacetime Transformations
Nonrelativistic Newton and Schroedinger equations remain correct not only
under holonomic but also under nonholonomic transformations of the spacetime
coordinates. Here we study the properties of transformations which are
holonomic in the space coordinates while additionally tranforming the time in a
path-dependent way. This makes them nonholonomic in spacetime. The resulting
transformation formulas of physical quantities establish relations between
different physical systems. Furthermore we point out certain
differential-geometric features of these relations.
