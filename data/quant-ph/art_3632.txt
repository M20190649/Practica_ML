Conditional quantum state engineering in repeated 2-photon down
  conversion
The U(1,1) and U(2) transformations realized by three-mode interaction in the
respective parametric approximations are studied in conditional measurement,
and the corresponding non-unitary transformation operators are derived. As an
application, the preparation of single-mode quantum states using an optical
feedback loop is discussed, with special emphasis of Fock state preparation.
For that example, the influence of non-perfect detection and feedback is also
considered.
