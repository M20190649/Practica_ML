Does entanglement depend on the timing of the impacts at the
  beam-splitters?
A new nonlocality experiment with moving beam-splitters is proposed. The
experiment is analysed according to conventional quantum mechanics, and to an
alternative nonlocal description in which superposition depends not only on
indistinguishability but also on the timing of the impacts at the
beam-splitters.
