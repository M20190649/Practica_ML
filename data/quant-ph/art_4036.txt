Experiment can decide between standard and Bohmian quantum mechanics
In this investigation, we have considered two thought experiments to make a
comparison between predictions of the standard and the Bohmian quantum
mechanics. Concerning this, a two-particle system has been studied at two
various situations of the entangled and the unentangled states. In the first
experiment, the two theories can predict different results at the individual
level, while their statistical results are the same. In the other experiment,
not only they are in disagreement at the individual level, but their
equivalence at the statistical level also breaks down, if one uses selective
detection. Furthermore, we discuss about some objections that can be raised
against the results of the two suggested experiments.
