Efficient Implementation and the Product State Representation of Numbers
The relation between the requirement of efficient implementability and the
product state representation of numbers is examined. Numbers are defined to be
any model of the axioms of number theory or arithmetic. Efficient
implementability (EI) means that the basic arithmetic operations are physically
implementable and the space-time and thermodynamic resources needed to carry
out the implementations are polynomial in the range of numbers considered.
Different models of numbers are described to show the independence of both EI
and the product state representation from the axioms. The relation between EI
and the product state representation is examined. It is seen that the condition
of a product state representation does not imply EI. Arguments used to refute
the converse implication, EI implies a product state representation, seem
reasonable; but they are not conclusive. Thus this implication remains an open
question.
