Asymmetric quantum channel for quantum teleportation
There are a few obstacles, which bring about imperfect quantum teleportation
of a continuous variable state, such as unavailability of maximally entangled
two-mode squeezed states, inefficient detection and imperfect unitary
transformation at the receiving station. We show that all those obstacles can
be understood by a combination of an {\it asymmetrically-decohered} quantum
channel and perfect apparatuses for other operations. For the
asymmetrically-decohered quantum channel, we find some counter-intuitive
results; one is that teleportation does not necessarily get better as the
channel is initially squeezed more and another is when one branch of the
quantum channel is unavoidably subject to some imperfect operations, blindly
making the other branch as clean as possible may not result in the best
teleportation result. We find the optimum strategy to teleport an unknown field
for a given environment or for a given initial squeezing of the channel.
