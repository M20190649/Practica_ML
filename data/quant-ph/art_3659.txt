The Schmidt Measure as a Tool for Quantifying Multi-Particle
  Entanglement
We present a measure of quantum entanglement which is capable of quantifying
the degree of entanglement of a multi-partite quantum system. This measure,
which is based on a generalization of the Schmidt rank of a pure state, is
defined on the full state space and is shown to be an entanglement monotone,
that is, it cannot increase under local quantum operations with classical
communication and under mixing. For a large class of mixed states this measure
of entanglement can be calculated exactly, and it provides a detailed
classification of mixed states.
