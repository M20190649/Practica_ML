Canonical pairs, Spatially Confined Motion and the Quantum Time of
  Arrival Problem
It has always been believed that no self-adjoint and canonical time of
arrival operator can be constructed within the confines of standard quantum
mechanics. In this Letter we demonstrate the otherwise. We do so by pointing
out that there is no a priori reason in demanding that canonical pairs form a
system of imprimitivities. We then proceed to show that a class of self-adjoint
and canonical time of arrival (TOA) operators can be constructed for a
spatially confined free particle. And then discuss the relatiobship between the
non-self-adjointess of the TOA operator for the unconfined particle and the
self-adjointness of the confined one.
