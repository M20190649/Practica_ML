Entanglement capabilities of non-local Hamiltonians
We quantify the capability of creating entanglement for a general physical
interaction acting on two qubits. We give a procedure for optimizing the
generation of entanglement. We also show that a Hamiltonian can create more
entanglement if one uses auxiliary systems.
