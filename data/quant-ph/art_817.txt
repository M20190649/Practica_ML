Phase Operator Problem and Macroscopic Extension of Quantum Mechanics
To find the Hermitian phase operatorof a single-mode electromagnetic field in
quantum mechanics, the Schroedinger representation is extended to a larger
Hilbert space augmented by states with infinite excitation by nonstandard
analysis. The Hermitian phase operator is shown to exist on the extended
Hilbert space. This operator is naturally considered as the controversial limit
of the approximate phase operators on finite dimensional spaces proposed by
Pegg and Barnett. The spectral measure of this operator is a Naimark extension
of the optimal probability operator-valued measure for the phase parameter
found by Helstrom. Eventually, the two promising approaches to the statistics
of the phase in quantum mechanics is unified by means of the Hermitian phase
operator in the macroscopic extension of the Schroedinger representation.
