Is the Statistical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Implied by the
  Correspondence Principle ?
The classical limit of the Schrodinger equation implies the orthodox
statistical interpretation for degrees of freedom in finite-dimensional
subspaces of the full Hilbert space, but the argument presented does not imply
the Born interpretation for degrees of freedom that have a classical
counterpart.
