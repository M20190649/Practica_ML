Distinguishability of the Bell states
More than two multipartite orthogonal states cannot always be discriminated
(with certainty) if only local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
are allowed. Using an existing inequality among the measures of entanglement,
we show that any three Bell states cannot be discriminated by LOCC. Exploiting
the inequality, we calculate the distillable entanglement of a certain class of
(4\otimes 4) mixed states.
