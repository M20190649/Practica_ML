Exact solutions for a family of discretely spiked harmonic oscillators
Factorization method is developed for a family of discretely spiked harmonic
oscillators. Two sets of intertwining and ladder operators are presented to
algebraically generate eigenstates with energies isomorphic to those of the
ordinary harmonic oscillator. Normalization conditions are examined to reject
unphysical cases. Generic theory is specialized to one dimensional linear
oscillator and N dimensional radial oscillators in odd dimensions N=1,3,5..,
where orthogonal basis or sets of staggered orthogonal bases can be identified.
Even dimensions N=2,4,6.. are rejected as ill defined since they do not lead to
properly defined bases. The theory is augmented by a short Haskell program
Spike, which directly implements the intertwining and ladder operators,
generates the eigenfunctions, tests integrability of the solutions, verifies
orthogonality conditions and tests consistency of theoretical claims.
