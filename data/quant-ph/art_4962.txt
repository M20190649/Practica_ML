Continuous quantum error correction via quantum feedback control
We describe a protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states
from decoherence that incorporates design principles from both quantum error
correction and quantum feedback control. Our protocol uses continuous
measurements and Hamiltonian operations, which are weaker control tools than
are typically assumed for quantum error correction. We develop a cost function
appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize our
state-estimate feedback. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study our protocol
for the three-qubit bit-flip code in detail and demonstrate that it can improve
the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable using quantum error
correction when the time between quantum error correction cycles is limited.
