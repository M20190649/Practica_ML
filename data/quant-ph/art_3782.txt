Applications of Integrated Magnetic Microtraps
Lithographically fabricated circuit patterns can provide magnetic guides and
microtraps for cold neutral atoms. By combining several such structures on the
same ceramic substrate, we have realized the first ``atom chips'' that permit
complex manipulations of ultracold trapped atoms or de Broglie wavepackets. We
show how to design magnetic potentials from simple conductor patterns and we
describe an efficient trap loading procedure in detail. Applying the design
guide, we describe some new microtrap potentials, including a trap which
reaches the Lamb-Dicke regime for rubidium atoms in all three dimensions, and a
rotatable Ioffe-Pritchard trap, which we also demonstrate experimentally.
Finally, we demonstrate a device allowing independent linear positioning of two
atomic clouds which are very tightly confined laterally. This device is well
suited for the study of one-dimensional collisions.
