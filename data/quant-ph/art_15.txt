CAUSALITY, MEMORY ERASING AND DELAYED CHOICE EXPERIMENTS
Comment on [R.L. Ingraham, Phys. Rev. A 50, 4502 (1994)]. Ingraham suggested
``a delayed-choice experiment with partial, controllable memory erasing''. It
is shown that he cannot be right since his predictions contradict relativistic
causality. A subtle quantum effect which was overlooked by Ingraham is
explained.
