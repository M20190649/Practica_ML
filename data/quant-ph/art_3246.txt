Effectively classical quantum states for open systems
Notions of robust and "classical" states for an open quantum system are
introduced and discussed in the framework of the isometric-sweeping
decomposition of trace class operators. Using the predictability sieve proposed
by Zurek, ``quasi-classical'' states are defined. A number of examples
illustrating how the ``quasi-classical'' states correspond to classical points
in phase space connected with the measuring apparatus are presented.
