Correlation between Quantum Mechanics and Classical Theory of Rotating
  Electron Models and Possible Experiment
It is shown that the point charge and magnetic moment of electron produce
together such a field that total electromagnetic momentum has a component
perpendicular to electron velocity. As a result classical electron models,
having magnetic moment, move not along a straight line, if there is no external
force, but along a spiral, the space period and radius of which are comparable
with de-Broglie wave length. Some other surprising coincidences with quantum
theory arise as a result of calculation. An experiment is proposed for direct
observation of quantum or of new type electron delocalization.
