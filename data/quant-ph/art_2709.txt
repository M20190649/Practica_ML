Transfer formalism for quantum optics problems
Consistent quantum formalism based on the localized basis of the Wannirer
functions in Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures to describe propagation of
electromagnetic field in a three dimensional media including diffraction is
presented. In the Schrodinger picture the Fokker-Planck equation for the
Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability and corresponding Langevin equations are
given. As result the space-time description is obtained by a simple changing
variables in the temporal master equation of the field. Using this formalism it
is shown that the existence of integrals of motion in the propagation of light
in a medium under the condition of nondegenerated parametric and two-photon
interactions results in amplification of modes when nonclassical properties of
the light are conserved. Quantum propagation of light in a linear medium taking
into account the diffraction is considered and its solution is found.
