Hybrid classical-quantum dynamics
A hybrid formalism is proposed for interacting classical and quantum sytems.
This formalism is mathematically consistent and reduces to standard classical
and quantum mechanics in the case of no interaction. However, in the presence
of interaction, the correspondence principle is violated.
