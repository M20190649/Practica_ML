Nonlocality of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state in the phase space
We discuss violation of Bell inequalities by the regularized
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state, which can be produced in a quantum optical
parametric down-conversion process. We propose an experimental photodetection
scheme to probe nonlocal quantum correlations exhibited by this state.
Furthermore, we show that the correlation functions measured in two versions of
the experiment are given directly by the Wigner function and the Q function of
the EPR state. Thus, the measurement of these two quasidistribution functions
yields a novel scheme for testing quantum nonlocality.
