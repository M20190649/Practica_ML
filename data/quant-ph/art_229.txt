Chaos in the Quantum Measurement Record
We investigate measures of chaos in the measurement record of a quantum
system which is being observed. Such measures are attractive because they can
be directly connected to experiment. Two measures of chaos in the measurement
record are defined and investigated numerically for the case of a quantum
kicked top. A smooth transition between chaotic and regular behavior is found.
