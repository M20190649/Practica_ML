Realistic Interaction-Free Detection of Objects in a Resonator
We propose a realistic device for detecting objects almost without
transferring a single quantum of energy to them. The device can work with an
efficiency close to 100% and relies on two detectors counting both presence and
absence of the objects. Its possible usage in performing fundamental
experiments as well as possible applications are discussed.
