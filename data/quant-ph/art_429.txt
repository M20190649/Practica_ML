Indistinguishable particles and hidden variables
An axiomatics for indistinguishability of elementary particles in terms of
hidden variables is presented in a manner which depart from the standard
approaches usually given to hidden variables. Quantum distribution functions
are also discussed and some related lines of work are suggested.
