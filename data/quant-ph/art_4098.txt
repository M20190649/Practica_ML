Gravitational bouncing of a quantum ball: Room for Airy's function Bi
I apply (i) a classical version of the Ermakov-Lewis procedure and (ii) the
strictly isospectral supersymmetric approach to the Schroedinger free fall of
the bouncing ball type. In both cases, the Airy function Bi, which in general
is eliminated as being unphysical, plays a well-defined role. Relevant plots
are displayed
