Estimation of Buttiker-Landauer traversal time based on the visibility
  of transmission current
We present a proposal for the estimation of B\"uttiker-Landauer traversal
time based on the visibility of transmission current. We analyze the tunneling
phenomena with a time-dependent potential and obtain the time-dependent
transmission current. We found that the visibility is directly connected to the
traversal time. Furthermore, this result is valid not only for rectangular
potential barrier but also for general form of potential to which the WKB
approximation is applicable . We compared these results with the numerical
values obtained from the simulation of Nelson's quantum mechanics. Both of them
fit together and it shows our method is very effective to measure
experimentally the traversal time.
