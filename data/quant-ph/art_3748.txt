Remote information concentration using a bound entangled state
Remote information concentration, the reverse process of quantum telecloning,
is presented. In this scheme, quantum information originally from a single
qubit, but now distributed into three spatially separated qubits, is remotely
concentrated back to a single qubit via an initially shared entangled state
without performing any global operations. This entangled state is an unlockable
bound entangled state and we analyze its properties.
