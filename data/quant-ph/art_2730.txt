Refined Factorizations of Solvable Potentials
A generalization of the factorization technique is shown to be a powerful
algebraic tool to discover further properties of a class of integrable systems
in Quantum Mechanics. The method is applied in the study of radial oscillator,
Morse and Coulomb potentials to obtain a wide set of raising and lowering
operators, and to show clearly the connection that link these systems.
