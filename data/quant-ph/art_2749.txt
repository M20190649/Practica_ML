Bell's inequalities for states with positive partial transpose
We study violations of n particle Bell inequalities (as developed by Mermin
and Klyshko) under the assumption that suitable partial transposes of the
density operator are positive. If all transposes with respect to a partition of
the system into p subsystems are positive, the best upper bound on the
violation is 2^((n-p)/2). In particular, if the partial transposes with respect
to all subsystems are positive, the inequalities are satisfied. This is
supporting evidence for a recent conjecture by Peres that positivity of partial
transposes could be equivalent to existence of local classical models.
