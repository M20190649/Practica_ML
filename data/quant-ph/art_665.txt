Time of Arrival in Event Enhanced Quantum Theory
The new solution to the problem of time of arrival in quantum theory is
presented herein. It allows for computer simulation of particle counters and it
implies Born's interpretation. It also suggests new experiments that can answer
the question: can a quantum particle detect a detector without being detected?
