On balance of information in bipartite quantum communication systems:
  entanglement-energy analogy
We adopt the view according to which information is the primary physical
entity that posseses objective meaning. Basing on two postulates that (i)
entanglement is a form of quantum information corresponding to internal energy
(ii) sending qubits corresponds to work, we show that in the closed bipartite
quantum communication systems the information is conserved. We also discuss
entanglement-energy analogy in context of the Gibbs-Hemholtz-like equation
connecting the entanglement of formation, distillable entanglement and bound
entanglement. Then we show that in the deterministic protocols of distillation
the information is conserved. We also discuss the objectivity of quantum
information in context of information interpretation of quantum states and
alghoritmic complexity.
