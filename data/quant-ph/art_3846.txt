A feasible "Kochen-Specker" experiment with single particles
We present a simple experimental scheme which can be used to demonstrate an
all-or-nothing type contradiction between non-contextual hidden variables and
quantum mechanics. The scheme, which is inspired by recent ideas by Cabello and
Garcia-Alcaine, shows that even for a single particle, path and spin
information cannot be predetermined in a non-contextual way.
