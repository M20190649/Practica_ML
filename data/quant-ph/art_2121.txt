Separability and distillability of multiparticle quantum systems
We present a family of 3--qubit states to which any arbitrary state can be
depolarized. We fully classify those states with respect to their separability
and distillability properties. This provides a sufficient condition for
nonseparability and distillability for arbitrary states. We generalize our
results to $N$--particle states.
