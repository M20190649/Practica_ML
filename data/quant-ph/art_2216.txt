Anomalous Acceleration Effects for Neutrons
Comparing the Dirac Hamiltonians for a neutron subjected to either a
Schwartzchild gravitational field or a uniform acceleration, we observe that
the difference between the two is precisely the sort that might be eliminated
by the introduction of a new quantum number. The origin of this quantum number
lies in the noncommutation of an acceleration with the quark operators that
constitute the neutron. We show that the term containing the new quantum number
only acts on very long length scales. Furthermore, the symmetries of an
acceleration prevent the effects of this term from being periodic.
