A dynamic model of atoms: structure, internal interactions and photon
  emissions of hydrogen
The standard solution of the Schroedinger equation for the hydrogen atom is
analyzed. Comparing with the recently established internal properties of
electrons it is found, that these solutions cannot be seen as physically valid
states of the electron wave. The paper therefore proposes a new model of
hydrogen based on internal properties of electrons. The ground state of the
hydrogen system (T=0) is an inertial aggregation within the atomic shell, the
calculation yields an atomic radius of 0.330 nm. Electron proton interaction
within the atom are treated with a causal and deterministic model, the
resonance frequency of the hydrogen system of $ 6.57 \times 10^{15} Hz $ is
referred to elastic deformations of its nucleus, resonance levels are a result
of boundary conditions for radial electron waves and photon interactions due to
nuclear oscillations. Spectral emissions of excited atoms can be referred to a
decay of the state of motion of the coupled electron-proton system. The
framework developed is essentially deterministic, microphysical processes
analyzed are referred to material characteristics of particles involved.
Statistical effects are referred to interactions with the atomic environment,
the results derived are compatible with the second and third principle of
thermodynamics.
