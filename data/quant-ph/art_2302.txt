Quantum synthesis of arbitrary unitary operators
Nature provides us with a restricted set of microscopic interactions. The
question is whether we can synthesize out of these fundamental interactions an
arbitrary unitary operator. In this paper we present a constructive algorithm
for realization of any unitary operator which acts on a (truncated) Hilbert
space of a single bosonic mode. In particular, we consider a physical
implementation of unitary transformations acting on 1-dimensional vibrational
states of a trapped ion. As an example we present an algorithm which realizes
the discrete Fourier transform.
