Quantum search without entanglement
Entanglement of quantum variables is usually thought to be a prerequisite for
obtaining quantum speed-ups of information processing tasks such as searching
databases. This paper presents methods for quantum search that give a speed-up
over classical methods, but that do not require entanglement. These methods
rely instead on interference to provide a speed-up. Search without entanglement
comes at a cost: although they outperform analogous classical devices, the
quantum devices that perform the search are not universal quantum computers and
require exponentially greater overhead than a quantum computer that operates
using entanglement. Quantum search without entanglement is compared to
classical search using waves.
