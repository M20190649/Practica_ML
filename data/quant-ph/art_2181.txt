Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Local Gates
I discuss how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation with concatenated
codes using local gates in small numbers of dimensions. I show that a threshold
result still exists in three, two, or one dimensions when
next-to-nearest-neighbor gates are available, and present explicit
constructions. In two or three dimensions, I also show how nearest-neighbor
gates can give a threshold result. In all cases, I simply demonstrate that a
threshold exists, and do not attempt to optimize the error correction circuit
or determine the exact value of the threshold. The additional overhead due to
the fault-tolerance in both space and time is polylogarithmic in the error rate
per logical gate.
