States prepared by decay
We consider the time evolution of a discrete state embedded in a continuum.
Results from scattering theory can be utilized to solve the initial value
problem and discuss the system as a model of wave packet preparation. Extensive
use is made of the analytic properties of the propagators, and simple model
systems are evaluated to illustrate the argument. We verify the exponential
appearence of the continuum state and its propagation as a localized wave
packet.
