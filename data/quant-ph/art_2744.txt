Entangled Coherent State Qubits in an Ion Trap
We show how entangled qubits can be encoded as entangled coherent states of
two-dimensional centre-of-mass vibrational motion for two ions in an ion trap.
The entangled qubit state is equivalent to the canonical Bell state, and we
introduce a proposal for entanglement transfer from the two vibrational modes
to the electronic states of the two ions in order for the Bell state to be
detected by resonance fluorescence shelving methods.
