Multiparty key distribution and secret sharing based on entanglement
  swapping
A general proof of the security against eavesdropping of a previously
introduced protocol for two-party quantum key distribution based on
entanglement swapping [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61}, 052312 (2000)] is provided. In
addition, the protocol is extended to permit multiparty quantum key
distribution and secret sharing of classical information.
