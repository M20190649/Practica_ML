Semiclassical Aspects of Quantum Mechanics by Classical Fluctuations
Building on a model recently proposed by F. Calogero, we postulate the
existence of a coherent, long--range universal tremor affecting any stable and
confined classical dynamical system. Deriving the characteristic fluctuative
unit of action for each classical interaction, we obtain in all cases its
numerical coincidence with the Planck action constant. We therefore suggest
that quantum corrections to classical dynamics can be simulated by suitable
classical stochastic fluctuations.
