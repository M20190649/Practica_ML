Coherent states of quantum non-linear systems
Quantum dynamics of integrable systems is discussed. Localized wave packets
generalizing the conventional coherent states of minimal uncertainty are
constructed. The wave packet moves along a certain trajectory and does not
change its shape for times of order $\frac{1}{\hbar}$.
