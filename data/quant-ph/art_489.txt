The Ithaca Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
I list several strong requirements for what I would consider a sensible
interpretation of quantum mechanics and I discuss two simple theorems. One, as
far as I know, is new; the other was only noted a few years ago. Both have
important implications for such a sensible interpretation. My talk will not
clear everything up; indeed, you may conclude that it has not cleared anything
up. But I hope it will provide a different perspective from which to view some
old and vexing puzzles (or, if you believe nothing needs to be cleared up, some
ancient verities.)
