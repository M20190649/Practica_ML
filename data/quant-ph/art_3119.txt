Nonlocal properties of two-qubit gates and mixed states and optimization
  of quantum computations
Entanglement of two parts of a quantum system is a non-local property
unaffected by local manipulations of these parts. It is described by quantities
invariant under local unitary transformations. Here we present, for a system of
two qubits, a set of invariants which provides a complete description of
non-local properties. The set contains 18 real polynomials of the entries of
the density matrix. We prove that one of two mixed states can be transformed
into the other by single-bit operations if and only if these states have equal
values of all 18 invariants. Corresponding local operations can be found
efficiently. Without any of these 18 invariants the set is incomplete.
  Similarly, non-local, entangling properties of two-qubit unitary gates are
invariant under single-bit operations. We present a complete set of 3 real
polynomial invariants of unitary gates. Our results are useful for optimization
of quantum computations since they provide an effective tool to verify if and
how a given two-qubit operation can be performed using exactly one elementary
two-qubit gate, implemented by a basic physical manipulation (and arbitrarily
many single-bit gates).
