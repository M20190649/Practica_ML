Operational Time of Arrival in Quantum Phase Space
An operational time of arrival is introduced using a realistic position and
momentum measurement scheme. The phase space measurement involves the dynamics
of a quantum particle probed by a measuring device. For such a measurement an
operational positive operator valued measure in phase space is introduced and
investigated. In such an operational formalism a quantum mechanical time
operator is constructed and analyzed. A phase space time and energy uncertainty
relation is derived.
