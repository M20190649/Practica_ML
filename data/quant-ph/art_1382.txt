Sonoluminescence Unveiled ?
The widening phenomenology of Single Bubble Sonoluminescence (SBSL) is shown
to be in good agreement with a new approach to condensed matter, based on the
QED coherent interactions. Some remarkable properties of SBSL are shown to
emerge from the electromagnetic release of part of the latent heat of the
water's vapour-liquid phase transition occurring at the bubble surface after it
becomes supersonic.
