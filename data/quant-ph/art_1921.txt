On the general problem of quantum phase estimation
The problem of estimating a generic phase-shift experienced by a quantum
state is addressed for a generally degenerate phase shift operator. The optimal
positive operator-valued measure is derived along with the optimal input state.
Two relevant examples are analyzed: i) a multi-mode phase shift operator for
multipath interferometry; ii) the two mode heterodyne phase detection.
