On oscillatorlike developments and further improvements in squeezing
A recent proposal of new sets of squeezed states is seen as a particular case
of a general context admitting realistic physical Hamiltonians. Such
improvements reveal themselves helpful in the study of associated squeezing
effects. Coherence is also considered.
