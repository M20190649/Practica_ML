Quantum feedback control and classical control theory
We introduce and discuss the problem of quantum feedback control in the
context of established formulations of classical control theory, examining
conceptual analogies and essential differences. We describe the application of
state-observer based control laws, familiar in classical control theory, to
quantum systems and apply our methods to the particular case of switching the
state of a particle in a double-well potential.
