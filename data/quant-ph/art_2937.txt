A Proof of the Security of Quantum Key Distribution
We prove the security of quantum key distribution against the most general
attacks which can be performed on the channel, by an eavesdropper who has
unlimited computation abilities, and the full power allowed by the rules of
classical and quantum physics. A key created that way can then be used to
transmit secure messages in a way that their security is also unaffected in the
future.
