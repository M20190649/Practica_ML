Optimal state estimation for d-dimensional quantum systems
We establish a connection between optimal quantum cloning and optimal state
estimation for d-dimensional quantum systems. In this way we derive an upper
limit on the fidelity of state estimation for d-dimensional pure quantum states
and, furthermore, for generalized inputs supported on the symmetric subspace.
