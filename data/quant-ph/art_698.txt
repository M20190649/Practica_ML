Uncertainty Relations for Two Dimensional Quantized Electromagnetic
  Potential
The canonical quantization of flux is performed. It is shown that according
to the canonical flux quantization there must be a new uncertainty relation: $e
\Delta A_m . \Delta x_m \geq \hbar$ where $A_m$ and $\Delta x_m \geq l_B$ are
the electromagnetic gauge potential, the position uncertainty and the magnetic
length, respectively. Other arguments in favour of this uncertainty relation
are also discussed.
