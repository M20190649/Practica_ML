A Local Model of Explicit Wavefunction Collapse
A model of spontaneous wavefunction collapse, which is explicitly local and
Lorentz-invariant, is defined. Some of the predictions of the model for
specific experimental situations are derived. It is shown that, although
incompatible collapses, e.g. on opposite sides of an EPR-type of experiment,
can occur, they will not persist in time and that eventually only compatible
results will be obtained. The probabilities of particular results, however,
will in general not agree with the predictions of quantum theory. We argue that
it is unlikely that the deviations would have been seen in any experiment yet
performed.
