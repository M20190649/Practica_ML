On Many-Minds Interpretations of Quantum Theory
This paper is a response to some recent discussions of many-minds
interpretations in the philosophical literature. After an introduction to the
many-minds idea, the complexity of quantum states for macroscopic objects is
stressed. Then it is proposed that a characterization of the physical structure
of observers is a proper goal for physical theory. It is argued that an
observer cannot be defined merely by the instantaneous structure of a brain,
but that the history of the brain's functioning must also be taken into
account. Next the nature of probability in many-minds interpretations is
discussed and it is suggested that only discrete probability models are needed.
The paper concludes with brief comments on issues of actuality and identity
over time.
