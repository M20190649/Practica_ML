Quantum computing with trapped ions, atoms and light
We first consider the basic requirements for a quantum computer, arguing for
the attractiveness of nuclear spins as information-bearing entities, and light
for the coupling which allows quantum gates. We then survey the strengths of
and immediate prospects for quantum information processing in ion traps. We
discuss decoherence and gate rates in ion traps, comparing methods based on the
vibrational motion with a method based on exchange of photons in cavity QED. We
then sketch the main features of a quantum computer designed to allow an
algorithm needing 10^6 Toffoli gates on 100 logical qubits. We find that around
200 ion traps linked by optical fibres and high-finesse cavities could perform
such an algorithm in a week to a month, using components at or near current
levels of technology.
