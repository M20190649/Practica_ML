Probability Distributions and Hilbert Spaces: Quantum and Classical
  Systems
We use the fact that some linear Hamiltonian systems can be considered as
``finite level'' quantum systems, and the description of quantum mechanics in
terms of probabilities, to associate probability distributions with this
particular class of linear Hamiltonian systems.
