Experimental realization of quantum games on a quantum computer
We generalize the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma to the case where the players
share a non maximally entangled states. We show that the game exhibits an
intriguing structure as a function of the amount of entanglement with two
thresholds which separate a classical region, an intermediate region and a
fully quantum region. Furthermore this quantum game is experimentally realized
on our nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer.
