Quantum Coherence Oscillations in Antiferromagnetic Chains
Macroscopic quantum coherence oscillations in mesoscopic antiferromagnets may
appear when the anisotropy potential creates a barrier between the
antiferromagnetic states with opposite orientations of the Neel vector. This
phenomenon is studied for the physical situation of the nuclear spin system of
eight Xe atoms arranged on a magnetic surface along a chain. The oscillation
period is calculated as a function of the chain constant. The environmental
decoherence effects at finite temperature are accounted assuming a dipole
coupling between the spin chain and the fluctuating magnetic field of the
surface. The numerical calculations indicate that the oscillations are damped
by a rate $\sim (N-1)/ \tau$, where $N$ is the number of spins and $\tau$ is
the relaxation time of a single spin.
