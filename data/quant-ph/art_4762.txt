Improved Hamilton-Jacobi Quantization for Nonholonomic Constrained
  System
The nonholonomic constrained system with second-class constraints is
investigated using the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) quantization scheme to yield the
complete equations of motion of the system. Although the integrability
conditions in the HJ scheme are equivalent to the involutive relations for the
first-class constrained system in the improved Dirac quantization method (DQM),
one should elaborate the HJ scheme by using the improved DQM in order to obtain
the first-class Hamiltonian and the corresponding effective Lagrangian having
the BRST invariant nonholonomic constrained system.
