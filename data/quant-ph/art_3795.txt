On the class of languages recognizable by 1-way quantum finite automata
It is an open problem to characterize the class of languages recognized by
quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient
conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a subclass
of regular languages we get a condition which is necessary and sufficient.
  Also, we prove that the class of languages recognizable by a QFA is not
closed under union or any other binary Boolean operation where both arguments
are significant.
