Comment on ``Sonoluminescence as Quantum Vacuum Radiation''
We contest the recent claim by C. Eberlein (Physical Review Letters 76 (1996)
3842) that sonoluminescence may be explained in terms of quantum vacuum
radiation. Due to fundamental physical limitations on bubble surface velocity,
the predicted number of photons per flash is indeed much smaller than unity.
Therefore, quantum vacuum radiation cannot be considered as an explanation of
the observed sonoluminescence phenomenon.
