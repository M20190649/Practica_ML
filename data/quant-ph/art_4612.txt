Conditional beam splitting attack on quantum key distribution
We present a novel attack on quantum key distribution based on the idea of
adaptive absorption [calsam01]. The conditional beam splitting attack is shown
to be much more efficient than the conventional beam spitting attack, achieving
a performance similar to the, powerful but currently unfeasible, photon number
splitting attack. The implementation of the conditional beam splitting attack,
based solely on linear optical elements, is well within reach of current
technology.
