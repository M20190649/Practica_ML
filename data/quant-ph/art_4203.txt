Dielectric black hole analogues
Alternative to the sonic black hole analogues we discuss a different scenario
for modeling the Schwarzschild geometry in a laboratory - the dielectric black
hole. The dielectric analogue of the horizon occurs if the velocity of the
medium with a finite permittivity exceeds the speed of light in that medium.
The relevance for experimental tests of the Hawking effect and possible
implications are addressed. PACS: 04.70.Dy, 04.62.+v, 04.80.-y, 42.50.Gy.
