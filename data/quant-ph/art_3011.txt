Quantum Mechanics As A Limiting Case of Classical Mechanics
In spite of its popularity, it has not been possible to vindicate the
conventional wisdom that classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum
mechanics. The purpose of the present paper is to offer an alternative point of
view in which quantum mechanics emerges as a limiting case of classical
mechanics in which the classical system is decoupled from its environment.
