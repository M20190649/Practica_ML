Quantum mechanics and the continuum problem (with referee reports)
It is shown that Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics can be reproduced
as a description of the set of intermediate cardinality. Properties of the set
follow directly from the independence of the continuum hypothesis. Six referee
reports of Physical Review Letters, Europhysics Letters, and Journal of Physics
A are enclosed.
