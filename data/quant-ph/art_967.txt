Moments of the Wigner Distribution and a Generalized Uncertainty
  Principle
The nonnegativity of the density operator of a state is faithfully coded in
its Wigner distribution, and this places constraints on the moments of the
Wigner distribution. These constraints are presented in a canonically invariant
form which is both concise and explicit. Since the conventional uncertainty
principle is such a constraint on the first and second moments, our result
constitutes a generalization of the same to all orders. Possible application in
quantum state reconstruction using optical homodyne tomography is noted.
