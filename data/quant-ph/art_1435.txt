Classical properties of generalized coherent states: from phase-space
  dynamics to Bell's inequality
We review classical properties of harmonic-oscillator coherent states. Then
we discuss which of these classical properties are preserved under the
group-theoretic generalization of coherent states. We prove that the
generalized coherent states of quantum systems with Lie-group symmetries are
the unique Bell states, i.e., the pure quantum states preserving the
fundamental classical property of satisfying Bell's inequality upon splitting.
