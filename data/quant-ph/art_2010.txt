Quantum Conditions of the Relativistic Potential Problems
The quantum conditions of the relativistic integrable systems whose classical
motion is multiply periodic are given by considering the single-valuedness of
the linear superposition of the approximate solutions $R_{i}\exp
{\{iS_{i}/\hbar \}}$ with $R_{i}$ and $S_{i}$ being the solutions of the
different branches of the current conservation equation and the relativistic
Hamilton-Jacobian equation, respectively.
