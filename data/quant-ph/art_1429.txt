Entanglement in Quantum Information Theory
Quantum mechanics has many counter-intuitive consequences which contradict
our intuition which is based on classical physics. Here we discuss a special
aspect of quantum mechanics, namely the possibility of entanglement between two
or more particles. We will establish the basic properties of entanglement using
quantum state teleportation. These principles will then allow us to formulate
quantitative measures of entanglement. Finally we will show that the same
general principles can also be used to prove seemingly difficult questions
regarding entanglement dynamics very easily. This will be used to motivate the
hope that we can construct a thermodynamics of entanglement.
