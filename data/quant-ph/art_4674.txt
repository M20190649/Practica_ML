Computational model underlying the one-way quantum computer
In this paper we present the computational model underlying the one-way
quantum computer which we introduced recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5188
(2001)]. The one-way quantum computer has the property that any quantum logic
network can be simulated on it. Conversely, not all ways of quantum information
processing that are possible with the one-way quantum computer can be
understood properly in network model terms. We show that the logical depth is,
for certain algorithms, lower than has so far been known for networks. For
example, every quantum circuit in the Clifford group can be performed on the
one-way quantum computer in a single step.
