Projective plane and planar quantum codes
Cellulations of the projective plane RP^2 define single qubit topological
quantum error correcting codes since there is a unique essential cycle in
H_1(RP^2;Z_2). We construct three of the smallest such codes, show they are
inequivalent, and identify one of them as Shor's original 9 qubit repetition
code. We observe that Shor's code can be constructed in a planar domain and
generalize to planar constructions of higher genus codes for multiple qubits.
