Observables in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
We propose a quantum clock synchronization protocol in which Bob makes a
remote measurement on Alice's quantum clock via a third qubit acting as its
proxy. It is shown that the resulting correlations are dependent on the choice
of the hypersurface along which Bob's measurement of the proxy is deemed to
collapse the entangled state vector. A proper characterization of observables
in relativistic quantum mechanics is therefore constrained by relativistic
covariance as well as causality.
