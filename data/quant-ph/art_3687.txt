Quantum strategies of quantum measurement
In classical Monty Hall problem, one player can always win with probability
2/3. We generalize the problem to the quantum domain and show that a fair
two-party zero-sum game can be carried out if the other player is permitted to
adopt quantum measurement strategy.
