Loading a continuous-wave atom laser by optical pumping techniques
Demonstrating that despite loss processes, Bose-Einstein condensates can be
formed in steady state is a prerequisite for obtaining a coherent beam of atoms
in a continuous-wave atom laser. In this paper we propose a method for loading
atoms into the thermal component of a Bose condensed cloud confined in a
magnetic trap. This method is aimed at allowing steady state dynamics to be
achieved. The proposed scheme involves loading atoms into the conservative
magnetic potential using the spontaneous emission of photons. We show that the
probability for the reabsorption of these photons may be small .
