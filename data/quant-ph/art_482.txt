Group Representations, Error Bases and Quantum Codes
This report continues the discussion of unitary error bases and quantum codes
begun in "Non-binary Unitary Error Bases and Quantum Codes". Nice error bases
are characterized in terms of the existence of certain characters in a group. A
general construction for error bases which are non-abelian over the center is
given. The method for obtaining codes due to Calderbank et al. is generalized
and expressed purely in representation theoretic terms. The significance of the
inertia subgroup both for constructing codes and obtaining the set of
transversally implementable operations is demonstrated.
