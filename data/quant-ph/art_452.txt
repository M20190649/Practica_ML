Time-of-arrival formalism for the relativistic particle
A suitable operator for the time-of-arrival at a detector is defined for the
free relativistic particle in 3+1 dimensions. For each detector position, there
exists a subspace of detected states in the Hilbert space of solutions to the
Klein Gordon equation. Orthogonality and completeness of the eigenfunctions of
the time-of-arrival operator apply inside this subspace, opening up a standard
probabilistic interpretation.
