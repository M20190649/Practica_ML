Interaction of Radiation and a Relativistic Electron in Motion in a
  Constant Magnetic Field
The work examines the effect of multiple photon emission on the quantum
mechanical state of an electron emitting synchrotron radiation and on the
intensity of that radiation. Calculations are done with the variant of
perturbation theory based on the use of extended coherent states. A general
formula is derived for the number of emitted photons, which allows for taking
into account their mutual interaction. A model problem is used to demonstrate
the absence of the infrared catastrophe in the modified perturbation theory.
Finally, the electron density matrix is calculated, and the analysis of this
matrix makes it possible to conclude that the degree of the elecron's spatial
localization increases with the passage of time if the electron is being
accelerated.
