Bohmian Mechanics and the Quantum Revolution
This is a review-essay on ``Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics''
by John Bell and ``The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of
Quantum Mechanics'' by David Bohm and Basil Hiley. The views of these authors
concerning the character of quantum theory and quantum reality---and, in
particular, their approaches to the issues of nonlocality, the possibility of
hidden variables, and the nature of and desiderata for a satisfactory
scientific explanation of quantum phenomena---are contrasted, with each other
and with the orthodox approach to these issues.
