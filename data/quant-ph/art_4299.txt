A uniqueness theorem for entanglement measures
We obtain a mathematically simple characterization of all functionals
coinciding with the von Neumann reduced entropy on pure states based on the
Khinchin-Faddeev axiomatization of Shannon entropy and give a physical
interpretation of the axioms in terms of entanglement.
