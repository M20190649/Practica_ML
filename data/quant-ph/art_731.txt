Decoherence of quantum registers
We consider decoherence of quantum registers, which consist of the qubits
sited approximately periodically in space. The sites of the qubits are
permitted to have a small random variance. We derive the explicit conditions
under which the qubits can be assumed decohering independently. In other
circumstances, the qubits are decohered cooperatively. We describe two kinds of
collective decoherence. In each case, a scheme is proposed for reducing the
collective decoherence. The schemes operate by encoding the input states of the
qubits into some ''subdecoherent'' states.
