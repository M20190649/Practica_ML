One-dimensional quantum chaos: Explicitly solvable cases
We present quantum graphs with remarkably regular spectral characteristics.
We call them {\it regular quantum graphs}. Although regular quantum graphs are
strongly chaotic in the classical limit, their quantum spectra are explicitly
solvable in terms of periodic orbits. We present analytical solutions for the
spectrum of regular quantum graphs in the form of explicit and exact periodic
orbit expansions for each individual energy level.
