Relativity and EPR Entanglement: Comments
Recent experiment by Zhinden et al (Phys. Rev {\bf A} 63 02111, 2001)
purports to test compatibility between relativity and quantum mechanics in the
classic EPR setting. We argue that relativity has no role in the EPR argument
based solely on non-relativistic quantum formalism. It is suggested that this
interesting experiment may have significance to address fundamental questions
on quantum probability.
