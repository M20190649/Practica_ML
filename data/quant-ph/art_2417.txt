Continuous Quantum Measurement and the Emergence of Classical Chaos
We formulate the conditions under which the dynamics of a continuously
measured quantum system becomes indistinguishable from that of the
corresponding classical system. In particular, we demonstrate that even in a
classically chaotic system the quantum state vector conditioned by the
measurement remains localized and, under these conditions, follows a trajectory
characterized by the classical Lyapunov exponent.
