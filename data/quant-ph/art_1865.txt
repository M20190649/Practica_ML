Remarks on identical particles in de Broglie-Bohm theory
It is argued that the topological approach to the (anti-)symmetrisation
condition for the quantum state of a collection of identical particles, defined
in the `reduced' configuration space, is particularly natural from the
perspective of de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory.
