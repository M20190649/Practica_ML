New Invariants and Separability criterion of the Mixed States: Bipartite
  Case
We introduce algebraic sets in the complex projective spaces for the mixed
states in bipartite quantum systems as their invariants under local unitary
operations. The algebraic sets of the mixed state have to be the union of the
linear subspaces if the mixed state is separable. Some examples are given and
studied based on our criterion
