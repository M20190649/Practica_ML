Quantum Mechanics from Symmetry and Statistical Modelling
A version of quantum theory is derived from a set of plausible assumptions
related to the following general setting: For a given system there is a set of
experiments that can be performed, and for each such experiment an ordinary
statistical model is defined. The parameters of the single experiments are
functions of a hyperparameter, which defines the state of the system. There is
a symmetry group acting on the hyperparameters, and for the induced action on
the parameters of the single experiment a simple consistency property is
assumed, called permissibility of the parametric function. The other
assumptions needed are rather weak. The derivation relies partly on quantum
logic, partly on a group representation of the hyperparameter group, where the
invariant spaces are shown to be in 1-1 correspondence with the equivalence
classes of permissible parametric functions. Planck's constant only plays a
role connected to generators of unitary group representations.
