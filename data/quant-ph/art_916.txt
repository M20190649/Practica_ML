Coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator and classical phase space
  trajectories
Unique set of coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator is obtained by
requiring i. under the quantum mechanical time evolution a coherent state
evolves into another, governed by trajectory in the classical phase space (of a
related hamiltonian); ii. the resolution of identity involves exactly the
classical phase space measure.The rules are invariant under unitary
transformations of the quantum theory and canonical transformations of the
classical theory. The states are almost, but not quite, minimal uncertainty
wave packets. The construction can be generalized to quantum versions of
integrable classical theories.
