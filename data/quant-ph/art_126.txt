Does Quantum Mechanics Save Free Will?
According to the widely accepted opinion, classical (statistical) physics
does not support objective indeterminism, since the statistical laws of
classical physics allow a deterministic hidden background, while --- as Arthur
Fine writes polemizing with Gr\"unbaum --- "{\sl the antilibertarian position
finds little room to breathe in a statistical world if we take laws of the
quantum theory as exemplars of the statistical laws in such a world. So, it
appears that, contrary to what Gr\"unbaum claims, the libertarians' 'could have
done otherwise' does indeed find support from indeterminism if we take the
indeterministic laws to be of the sort found in the quantum theory.}" In this
paper I will show that, quite the contrary, quantum mechanics does not save
free will. For instance, the EPR experiments are compatible with a
deterministic world. They admit a deterministic local hidden parameter
description if the deterministic model is 'allowed' to describe not only the
measurement outcomes, but also the outcomes of the 'decisions' whether this or
that measurement will be performed. So, the derivation of the freedom of the
will from quantum mechanics is a tautology: from the assumption that the world
is indeterministic it is derived that the world cannot be deterministic.
