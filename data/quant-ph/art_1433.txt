Quantum Communication with Phantom Photons
We show that quantum information may be transferred between atoms in
different locations by using ``phantom photons'': the atoms are coupled through
electromagnetic fields, but the corresponding field modes do not have to be
fully populated. In the case where atoms are placed inside optical cavities,
errors in quantum information processing due to photon absorption inside the
cavity are diminished in this way. This effect persists up to intercavity
distances of about a meter for the current levels of cavity losses, and may be
useful for distributed quantum computing.
