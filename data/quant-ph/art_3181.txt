Light Pulse Squeezed State Formation In Medium With The Relaxation Kerr
  Nonlinearity
The consistent theory of formation of pulsed squeezed states as a result of
self-action of ultrashort light pulse in the medium with relaxation Kerr
nonlinearity has been developed. A simple method to form the ultrashort light
pulse with sub-Poissonian photon statistics is analyzed too.
