Homodyne Bell's inequalities for entangled mesoscopic superpositions
We present a scheme for demonstrating violation of Bell's inequalities using
a spin-1/2 system entangled with a pair of classically distinguishable wave
packets in a harmonic potential. In the optical domain, such wave packets can
be represented by coherent states of a single light mode. The proposed scheme
involves standard spin-1/2 projections and measurements of the position and the
momentum of the harmonic oscillator system, which for a light mode can be
realized by means of homodyne detection. We discuss effects of imperfections,
including non-unit efficiency of the homodyne detector, and point out a close
link between the visibility of interference and violation of Bell's
inequalities in the described scheme.
