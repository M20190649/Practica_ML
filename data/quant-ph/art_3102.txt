Entanglement and quantum computation with ions in thermal motion
With bichromatic fields it is possible to deterministically produce entangled
states of trapped ions. In this paper we present a unified analysis of this
process for both weak and strong fields, for slow and fast gates. Simple
expressions for the fidelity of creating maximally entangled states of two or
an arbitrary number of ions under non-ideal conditions are derived and
discussed.
