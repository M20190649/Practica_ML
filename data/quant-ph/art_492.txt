Quantum nonlocality and inseparability
A quantum system consisting of two subsystems is separable if its density
matrix can be written as $\rho=\sum w_K \rho_K'\otimes \rho_K''$, where
$\rho_K'$ and $\rho_K''$ are density matrices for the two subsytems, and the
positive weights $w_K$ satisfy $\sum w_K=1$. A necessary condition for
separability is derived and is shown to be more sensitive than Bell's
inequality for detecting quantum inseparability. Moreover, collective tests of
Bell's inequality (namely, tests that involve several composite systems
simultaneously) may sometimes lead to a violation of Bell's inequality, even if
the latter is satisfied when each composite system is tested separately.
