Introduction to Quantum Algorithms
These notes discuss the quantum algorithms we know of that can solve problems
significantly faster than the corresponding classical algorithms. So far, we
have only discovered a few techniques which can produce speed up versus
classical algorithms. It is not clear yet whether the reason for this is that
we do not have enough intuition to discover more techniques, or that there are
only a few problems for which quantum computers can significantly speed up the
solution.
