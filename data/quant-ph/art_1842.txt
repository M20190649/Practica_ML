Quantum statistics of atoms in microstructures
This paper proposes groove-like potential structures for the observation of
quantum information processing by trapped particles. As an illustration the
effect of quantum statistics at a 50-50 beam splitter is investigated. For
non-interacting particles we regain the results known from photon experiments,
but we have found that particle interactions destroy the perfect bosonic
correlations. Fermions avoid each other due to the exclusion principle and
hence they are far less sensitive to particle interactions. For bosons, the
behavior can be explained with simple analytic considerations which predict a
certain amount of universality. This is verified by detailed numerical
calculations.
