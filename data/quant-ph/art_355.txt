Two-Photon Algebra Eigenstates: A Unified Approach to Squeezing
We use the concept of the algebra eigenstates that provides a unified
description of the generalized coherent states (belonging to different sets)
and of the intelligent states associated with a dynamical symmetry group. The
formalism is applied to the two-photon algebra and the corresponding algebra
eigenstates are studied by using the Fock-Bargmann analytic representation.
This formalism yields a unified analytic approach to various types of
single-mode photon states generated by squeezing and displacing
transformations.
