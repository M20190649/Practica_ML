Supersymmetry of a Nonstationary Pauli Equation
The supersymmetry of the electron in both the nonstationary magnetic and
electric fields in a two-dimensional case is studied. The supercharges which
are the integrals of motion and their algebra are established. Using the
obtained algebra the solutions of nonstationary Pauli equation are generated.
