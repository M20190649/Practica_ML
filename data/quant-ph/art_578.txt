Density Matrix From Photon Number Tomography
We provide a simple analytic relation which connects the density operator of
the radiation field with the number probabilities. The problem of
experimentally "sampling" a general matrix elements is studied, and the
deleterious effects of nonunit quantum efficiency in the detection process are
analyzed showing how they can be reduced by using the squeezing technique. The
obtained result is particulary useful for intracavity field reconstruction
states.
