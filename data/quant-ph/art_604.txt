A quantum-mechanical Maxwell's demon
A Maxwell's demon is a device that gets information and trades it in for
thermodynamic advantage, in apparent (but not actual) contradiction to the
second law of thermodynamics. Quantum-mechanical versions of Maxwell's demon
exhibit features that classical versions do not: in particular, a device that
gets information about a quantum system disturbs it in the process. In
addition, the information produced by quantum measurement acts as an additional
source of thermodynamic inefficiency. This paper investigates the properties of
quantum-mechanical Maxwell's demons, and proposes experimentally realizable
models of such devices.
