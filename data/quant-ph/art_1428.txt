Dispersion of Klauder's temporally stable coherent states for the
  hydrogen atom
We study the dispersion of the "temporally stable" coherent states for the
hydrogen atom introduced by Klauder. These are states which under temporal
evolution by the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian retain their coherence properties.
We show that in the hydrogen atom such wave packets do not move
quasi-classically; i.e., they do not follow with no or little dispersion the
Keplerian orbits of the classical electron. The poor quantum-classical
correspondence does not improve in the semiclassical limit.
