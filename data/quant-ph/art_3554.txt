Complete Bell state measurement with controlled photon absorption and
  quantum interference
A solid state device to discriminate all the four Bell states is proposed.
The device is composed of controlled absorption crystals, rotators, and
retarders. The controlled absorption, where the state of one photon affects the
absorption of the other photon, is realized by two photon absorption in a cubic
crystal. The controlled absorption crystal detects a particular Bell state and
is transparent for the other Bell states. The rotators and retarders transform
a Bell state to another. This device may solve the problems in the early
quantum teleportation experiments in photon polarization states.
