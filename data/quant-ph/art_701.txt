Resilient Quantum Computation: Error Models and Thresholds
Recent research has demonstrated that quantum computers can solve certain
types of problems substantially faster than the known classical algorithms.
These problems include factoring integers and certain physics simulations.
Practical quantum computation requires overcoming the problems of environmental
noise and operational errors, problems which appear to be much more severe than
in classical computation due to the inherent fragility of quantum
superpositions involving many degrees of freedom. Here we show that arbitrarily
accurate quantum computations are possible provided that the error per
operation is below a threshold value. The result is obtained by combining
quantum error-correction, fault tolerant state recovery, fault tolerant
encoding of operations and concatenation. It holds under physically realistic
assumptions on the errors.
