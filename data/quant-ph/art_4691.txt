'Photosynthetic' Quantum Computers?
Do quantum computers already exist in Nature? It is proposed that they do.
Photosynthesis is one example in which a 'quantum computer' component may play
a role in the 'classical' world of complex biological systems. A 'translation'
of the standard metabolic description of the 'front-end' light harvesting
complex in photosynthesis into the language of quantum computers is presented.
Biological systems represent an untapped resource for thinking about the design
and operation of hybrid quantum-classical computers and expanding our current
conceptions of what defines a 'quantum computer' in Nature.
