Entanglement degree for Jaynes-Cummings model
Recently, it has been known that a quantum entangled state plays an important
role in the field ofquantum information theory such as quantum teleportation
and quantum computation. The research on quantifying entangled states has been
done by several measures. In this letter, we will adopt the method using
quantum mutual entropy to measure the degree of entanglement of Jaynes-Cummings
model.
