Entanglement and pseudomixtures
In a recent paper Sanpera et al. have shown, that for the simplest binary
composite systems any density matrix can be described in terms of only product
vectors. The purpose of this note is to show that posibillity of decomposing
any state as pseudomixtures does not depend on dimension of the subsystems.
