The Casimir Effect and Thermodynamic Instability
One loop field theory calculations of free energies quite often yield
violations of the stability conditions associated with the thermodynamic second
law. Perhaps the best known example involves the equation of state of black
holes. Here, it is pointed out that the Casimir force between two parallel
conducting plates also violates a thermodynamic stability condition normally
associated with the second law of thermodynamics.
