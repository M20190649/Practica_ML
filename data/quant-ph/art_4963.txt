General Scheme for Super Dense Coding between Multi-Parties
Dense coding or super-dense coding in the case of high-dimension quantum
states between two parties and multi-parties has been studied in this paper. We
construct explicitly the measurement basis and the forms of the single-body
unitary operations corresponding to the basis chosen, and the rules for
selecting the one-body unitary operations in a multi-party case.
