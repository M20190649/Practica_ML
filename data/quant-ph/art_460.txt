Beneath Gauge
Seeking a relativistic quantum infrastructure for gauge physics, we analyze
spacetime into three levels of quantum aggregation analogous to atoms, bonds
and crystals. Quantum spacetime points with no extension make up more complex
link units with microscopic extension, which make up networks with macroscopic
extension. Such a multilevel quantum theory implies parastatistics for the
lowest level entities without additional physical assumptions. Any hypercubical
vacuum mode with off-diagonal long-range order that is covariant under
$\POINCARE$ also has bonus internal symmetries somewhat like those of the
standard model. A vacuum made with the dipole link proposed earlier has too
much symmetry. A quadrupole link solves this problem.
