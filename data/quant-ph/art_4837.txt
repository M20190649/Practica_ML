Mixed-state entanglement and quantum communication
We present basics of mixed-state entanglement theory. The first part of the
article is devoted to mathematical characterizations of entangled states. In
second part we discuss the question of using mixed-state entanglement for
quantum communication. In particular, a type of entanglement that is not
directly useful for quantum communcation (called bound entanglement) is
analysed in detail.
