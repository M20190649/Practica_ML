Quantum teleportation criteria for continuous variables
We discuss the criteria presently used for evaluating the efficiency of
quantum teleportation schemes for continuous variables. It is argued that the
fidelity criterion used so far has some severe drawbacks, and that a fidelity
value larger than 2/3 is actually required for successful quantum
teleportation. This value has never been reached experimentally so far.
