Fast quantum verification for the formulas of predicate calculus
Quantum algorithm is constructed which verifies the formulas of predicate
calculus in time $O(\sqrt N)$ with bounded error probability, where $N$ is the
time required for classical algorithms. This algorithm uses the polynomial
number of simultaneous oracle queries. This is a modification of the result of
Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson quant-ph/9802040.
