The Encoding of Quantum State Information Within Subparticles
A method is given by which the descriptive content of quantum state
information can be encoded into subparticle coordinates. This method is
consistent with the MA-model solution to the general grand unification problem.
Subparticle mechanisms via affine or linear transformations are also discussed.
