Decoherence Bounds on Quantum Computation with Trapped Ions
Using simple physical arguments we investigate the capabilities of a quantum
computer based on cold trapped ions. From the limitations imposed on such a
device by spontaneous decay, laser phase coherence, ion heating and other
sources of error, we derive a bound between the number of laser interactions
and the number of ions that may be used. The largest number which may be
factored using a variety of species of ion is determined.
