Three-qubit pure-state canonical forms
In this paper we analyze the canonical forms into which any pure three-qubit
state can be cast. The minimal forms, i.e. the ones with the minimal number of
product states built from local bases, are also presented and lead to a
complete classification of pure three-qubit states. This classification is
related to the values of the polynomial invariants under local unitary
transformations by a one-to-one correspondence.
