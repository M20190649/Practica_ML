Reply to `Singularities of the mixed state phase'
The only difference between Bhandari's viewpoint [quant-ph/0108058] and ours
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 2845 (2000)] is that our phase is defined modulo $2\pi$,
whereas Bhandari argues that two phases that differ by $2\pi n$, $n$ integer,
may be distinguished experimentally in a history-dependent manner.
