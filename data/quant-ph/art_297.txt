The Edge Currents in IQHE
It is shown that an observed length in the potential drops across IQHE
samples is a universal length for a given magnetic field strength which has the
magnitude equal to the reciprocal magnitude of magnetic length and which
results from the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation in presence of
magnetic field. The analytic solution of Ohm's equation for the potential in
Corbino sample in IQHE is also given.
