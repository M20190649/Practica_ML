Quantization of the Dirac Fibre: a New Way in the Particle Physics
The problem of ultraviolet divergences is analysed in the quantum field
theory. It was found that it has common roots with the problem of cosmological
singularity. In the context of fibre bundles the second quantization method is
represented as a procedure of the quantization for vector bundle cross-section.
It is shown to be quite a different quantization way called as a fibre
quantization which leads to an idea on existence of the non-standard dynamical
system, i.e. the relativistic be-Hamiltonian system. It takes place on
supersmall distances and is well described by the mathematical apparatus for
the non-unitary quantum scheme using a dual pair of topological vector spaces
in terms of the non-Hermitian form. The article contains the proof of the
theorem on radical changes in space and in matter structure taking place for a
very high density of matter: the phase transitions ``Lagrangian field system
(elementary particles) $\to$ relativistic bi-Hamiltonian system (Feynman's
partons)'' and ``continuum $\to$ discontinuum''.
  All required calculations in the framework of the proposed theory are
published in the Russian periodicals. The purpose of this article is to replace
the calculations by reasonings and concepts. The present article begins the
systematic exposition of principles of the theory.
