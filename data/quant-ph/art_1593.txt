How to Teleport Superpositions of Chiral Amplitudes
Chiral molecules may exist in superpositions of left- and right-handed
states. We show how the amplitudes of such superpositions may be teleported to
the polarization degrees of freedom of a photon and thus measured. Two
experimental schemes are proposed, one leading to perfect, the other to
state-dependent teleportation. Both methods yield complete information about
the amplitudes.
