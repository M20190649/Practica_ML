Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy Measurement of Entangled Spin States
We simulate magnetic resonance force microscopy measurements of an entangled
spin state. One of the entangled spins drives the resonant cantilever
vibrations, while the other remote spin does not interact directly with the
quasiclassical cantilever. The Schr\"odinger cat state of the cantilever
reveals two possible outcomes of the measurement for both entangled spins.
