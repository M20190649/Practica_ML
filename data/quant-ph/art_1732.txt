The Fermi accelerator in atom optics
We study the classical and quantum dynamics of a Fermi accelerator realized
by an atom bouncing off a modulated atomic mirror. We find that in a window of
the modulation amplitude dynamical localization occurs in both position and
momentum. A recent experiment [A. Steane, P. Szriftgiser, P. Desbiolles, and J.
Dalibard, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 74}, 4972 (1995)] shows that this system can be
implemented experimentally.
