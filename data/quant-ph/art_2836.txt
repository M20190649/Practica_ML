Classification of multi-qubit mixed states: separability and
  distillability properties
We give a complete, hierarchic classification for arbitrary multi-qubit mixed
states based on the separability properties of certain partitions. We introduce
a family of N-qubit states to which any arbitrary state can be depolarized.
This family can be viewed as the generalization of Werner states to multi-qubit
systems. We fully classify those states with respect to their separability and
distillability properties. This provides sufficient conditions for
nonseparability and distillability for arbitrary states.
