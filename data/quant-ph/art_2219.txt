Between Schroedinger and Hermite: Supersymmetric pair of q-deformed
  non-local operators
A simple version of the q-deformed calculus is used to generate a pair of
q-nonlocal, second-order difference operators by means of deformed counterparts
of Darboux intertwining operators for zero factorization energy. These deformed
non-local operators may be considered as supersymmetric partners and their
structure contains contributions originating in both the Hermite operator and
the quantum harmonic oscillator operator. There are also extra $\pm x$
contributions. The undeformed limit, in which all q-nonlocalities wash out,
corresponds to the usual supersymmetric pair of quantum mechanical harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonians. The more general case of negative factorization energy
is briefly discussed as well
