Experimental realization of a quantum algorithm
Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are used to realize a quantum algorithm
experimentally. The algorithm allows a simple NMR quantum computer to determine
global properties of an unknown function requiring fewer function ``calls''
than is possible using a classical computer.
