Quantum Revivals in a Periodically Driven Gravitational Cavity
Quantum revivals are investigated for the dynamics of an atom in a driven
gravitational cavity. It is demonstrated that the external driving field
influences the revival time significantly. Analytical expressions are presented
which are based on second order perturbation theory and semiclassical secular
theory. These analytical results explain the dependence of the revival time on
the characteristic parameters of the problem quantitatively in a simple way.
They are in excellent agreement with numerical results.
