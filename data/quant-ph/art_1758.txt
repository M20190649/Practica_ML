Dynamical Decoupling of Open Quantum Systems
We propose a novel dynamical method for beating decoherence and dissipation
in open quantum systems. We demonstrate the possibility of filtering out the
effects of unwanted (not necessarily known) system-environment interactions and
show that the noise-suppression procedure can be combined with the capability
of retaining control over the effective dynamical evolution of the open quantum
system. Implications for quantum information processing are discussed.
