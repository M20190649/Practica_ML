Fast and User-friendly Quantum Key Distribution
Some guidelines for the comparison of different quantum key distribution
experiments are proposed. An improved 'plug & play' interferometric system
allowing fast key exchange is then introduced. Self-alignment and compensation
of birefringence remain. Original electronics implementing the BB84 protocol
and allowing user-friendly operation is presented. Key creation with 0.1 photon
per pulse at a rate of 486 Hz with a 5.4% QBER - corresponding to a net rate of
210Hz - over a 23 Km installed cable was performed.
