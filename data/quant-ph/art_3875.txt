Schmidt number witnesses and bound entanglement
The Schmidt number of a mixed state characterizes the minimum Schmidt rank of
the pure states needed to construct it. We investigate the Schmidt number of an
arbitrary mixed state by constructing a Schmidt number witness that detects it.
We present a canonical form of such witnesses and provide constructive methods
for their optimization. Finally, we present strong evidence that all bound
entangled states with positive partial transpose in two qutrit systems have
Schmidt number 2.
