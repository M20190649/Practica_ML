A Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy Quantum Computer with Tellurium
  Donors in Silicon
We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM)-based nuclear spin
quantum computer using tellurium impurities in silicon. This approach to
quantum computing combines the well-developed silicon technology with expected
advances in MRFM.
