Towards a Unified Description of the Fundamental Interactions
We consider a recent successful model of leptons as Kerr-Newman type Black
Holes in a Quantum Mechanical context. The model leads to a cosmology which
predicts an ever expanding accelerating universe with decreasing density and to
the conclusion that at Compton wavelength scales, electrons would exhibit low
dimensionality, both of which conclusions have been verified by several
independent experiments and observations very recently. In this preliminary
communication we indicate how the above model describes the quarks' fractional
charges, handedness and masses (as any fundamental theory should) and could
lead to a unified description of the four fundamental interactions.
