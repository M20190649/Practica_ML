Vacuum fluctuation force on a rigid Casimir cavity in a gravitational
  field
We discuss the possibility of verifying the equivalence principle for the
zero-point energy of quantum electrodynamics, by evaluating the force, produced
by vacuum fluctuations, acting on a rigid Casimir cavity in a weak
gravitational field. The resulting force has opposite direction with respect to
the gravitational acceleration; the order of magnitude for a multi-layer cavity
configuration is derived and experimental feasibility is discussed, taking into
account current technological resources.
