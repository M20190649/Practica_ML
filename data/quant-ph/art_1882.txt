Time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equations having isomorphic symmetry
  algebras. II. Symmetry algebras, coherent and squeezed states
Using the transformations from paper I, we show that the Schr\"odinger
equations for: (1)systems described by quadratic Hamiltonians, (2) systems with
time-varying mass, and (3) time-dependent oscillators, all have isomorphic Lie
space-time symmetry algebras. The generators of the symmetry algebras are
obtained explicitly for each case and sets of number-operator states are
constructed. The algebras and the states are used to compute
displacement-operator coherent and squeezed states. Some properties of the
coherent and squeezed states are calculated. The classical motion of these
states is deomonstrated.
