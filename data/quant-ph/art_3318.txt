Quantum Computing Using Dissipation to Remain in a Decoherence-Free
  Subspace
We propose a new approach to the implementation of quantum gates in which
decoherence during the gate operations is strongly reduced. This is achieved by
making use of an environment induced quantum Zeno effect that confines the
dynamics effectively to a decoherence-free subspace.
