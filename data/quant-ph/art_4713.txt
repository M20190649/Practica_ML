Phase-selective reversible quantum decoherence in cavity QED experiment
New feasible cavity QED experiment is proposed to analyse reversible quantum
decoherence in consequence of quantum complementarity and entanglement.
Utilizing the phase selective manipulations with enviroment, it is demonstrated
how the complementarity particularly induces a preservation of visibility,
whereas quantum decoherence is more progressive due to pronounced entanglement
between system and enviroment. This effect can be directly observed using the
proposed cavity QED measurements.
