Negative entropy in quantum information theory
We present a quantum information theory that allows for the consistent
description of quantum entanglement. It parallels classical (Shannon)
information theory but is based entirely on density matrices, rather than
probability distributions, for the description of quantum ensembles. We find
that, unlike in Shannon theory, conditional entropies can be negative when
considering quantum entangled systems such as an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair,
which leads to a violation of well-known bounds of classical information
theory. Negative quantum entropy can be traced back to ``conditional'' density
matrices which admit eigenvalues larger than unity. A straightforward
definition of mutual quantum entropy, or ``mutual entanglement'', can also be
constructed using a ``mutual'' density matrix. Such a unified
information-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum
entanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as
``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a
ternary or larger system.
