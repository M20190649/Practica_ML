Note on Separability of the Werner states in arbitrary dimensions
Great progress has been made recently in establishing conditions for
separability of a particular class of Werner densities on the tensor product
space of $n$ $d$--level systems (qudits). In this brief note we complete the
process of establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of
these Werner densities by proving the sufficient condition for general n and d.
