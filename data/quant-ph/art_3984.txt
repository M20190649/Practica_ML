Photon-photon correlations and entanglement in doped photonic crystals
We consider a photonic crystal (PC) doped with four-level atoms whose
intermediate transition is coupled near-resonantly with a photonic band-gap
edge. We show that two photons, each coupled to a different atomic transition
in such atoms, can manifest strong phase or amplitude correlations: One photon
can induce a large phase shift on the other photon or trigger its absorption
and thus operate as an ultrasensitive nonlinear photon-switch. These features
allow the creation of entangled two-photon states and have unique advantages
over previously considered media: (i) no control lasers are needed; (ii) the
system parameters can be chosen to cause full two-photon entanglement via
absorption; (iii) a number of PCs can be combined in a network.
