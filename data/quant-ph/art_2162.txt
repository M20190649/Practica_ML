Decoherence - Fluctuation Relation and Measurement Noise
We discuss fluctuations in the measurement process and how these fluctuations
are related to the dissipational parameter characterising quantum damping or
decoherence. On the example of the measuring current of the variable-barrier or
QPC problem we show there is an extra noise or fluctuation connected with the
possible different outcomes of a measurement. This noise has an enhanced short
time component which could be interpreted as due to ``telegraph noise'' or
``wavefunction collapses''. Furthermore the parameter giving the the strength
of this noise is related to the parameter giving the rate of damping or
decoherence.
