Partitioning optical solitons for generating entangled light beams
It is shown that bipartition of optical solitons can be used to generate
entangled light beams. The achievable amount of entanglement can be
substantially larger for N-bound solitons N=2,3 than for the fundamental
soliton (N=1). An analysis of the mode structure of the entangled beams shows
that just N modes are essentially entangled. In particular, partitioning of the
fundamental soliton effectively produces 2-mode squeezed light.
