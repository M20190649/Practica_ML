Quantum State Disturbance vs. Information Gain: Uncertainty Relations
  for Quantum Information
When an observer wants to identify a quantum state, which is known to be one
of a given set of non-orthogonal states, the act of observation causes a
disturbance to that state. We investigate the tradeoff between the information
gain and that disturbance. This issue has important applications in quantum
cryptography. The optimal detection method, for a given tolerated disturbance,
is explicitly found in the case of two equiprobable non-orthogonal pure states.
