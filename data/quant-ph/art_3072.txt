Husimi Transform of an Operator Product
It is shown that the series derived by Mizrahi, giving the Husimi transform
(or covariant symbol) of an operator product, is absolutely convergent for a
large class of operators. In particular, the generalized Liouville equation,
describing the time evolution of the Husimi function, is absolutely convergent
for a large class of Hamiltonians. By contrast, the series derived by
Groenewold, giving the Weyl transform of an operator product, is often only
asymptotic, or even undefined. The result is used to derive an alternative way
of expressing expectation values in terms of the Husimi function. The advantage
of this formula is that it applies in many of the cases where the anti-Husimi
transform (or contravariant symbol) is so highly singular that it fails to
exist as a tempered distribution.
