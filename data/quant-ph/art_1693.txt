Using Parity Kicks for Decoherence Control
We show how it is possible to suppress decoherence using tailored external
forcing acting as pulses. In the limit of infinitely frequent pulses
decoherence and dissipation are completely frozen; however, a significant
decoherence suppression is already obtained when the frequency of the pulses is
of the order of the reservoir typical frequency scale. This method could be
useful in particular to suppress the decoherence of the center-of-mass motion
in ion traps.
