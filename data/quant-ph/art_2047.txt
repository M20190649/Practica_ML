Towards Quantifying Non-Local Information Transfer: Finite-Bit
  Non-Locality
The advent of Bell's inequalities provoked the possibility that entangled
quantum phenomena is non-local in nature. Since teleportation only requires a
finite amount of classical information, i.e. two bits, the author asks whether
or not it is possible to further characterize the nature of internal
correlation in terms of information. Towards this end, the issue of the amount
of information that is transferred internally and non-locally is addressed.
There are two possibilities: the amount is infinite or the amount is finite. A
partial answer to this problem is given: it is shown that models exist whereby
the amount is finite. The EPR-Bell cosine correlation can be reproduced exactly
using on average 1.48 bits. The issue of simultaneity and the problems it poses
are also examined in this context. Several extensions are suggested.
