Photon Polarization Measurements without the Quantum Zeno Effect
We consider a photon beam incident on a stack of polarizers as an example of
a von Neumann projective measurement, theoretically leading to the quantum Zeno
effect. The Maxwell theory (which is equivalent to the single photon
Schr\"odinger equation) describes measured polarization phenomena, but without
recourse to the notion of a projective measurement.
