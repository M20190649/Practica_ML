Wigner's Problem and Alternative Commutation Relations for Quantum
  Mechanics
It is shown, that for quantum systems the vectorfield associated with the
equations of motion may admit alternative Hamiltonian descriptions, both in the
Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures. We illustrate these ambiguities in terms
of simple examples.
