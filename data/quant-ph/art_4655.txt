Entangling macroscopic oscillators exploiting radiation pressure
It is shown that radiation pressure can be profitably used to entangle {\it
macroscopic} oscillators like movable mirrors, using present technology. We
prove a new sufficient criterion for entanglement and show that the achievable
entanglement is robust against thermal noise. Its signature can be revealed
using common optomechanical readout apparatus.
