New nonlinear coherent states and some of their nonclassical properties
We construct a displacement operator type nonlinear coherent state and
examine some of its properties. In particular it is shown that this nonlinear
coherent state exhibits nonclassical properties like squeezing and
sub-Poissonian behaviour.
