Observations of Quantum Dynamics by Solution-State NMR Spectroscopy
NMR is emerging as a valuable testbed for the investigation of foundational
questions in quantum mechanics. The present paper outlines the preparation of a
class of mixed states, called pseudo-pure states, that emulate pure quantum
states in the highly mixed environment typically used to describe
solution-state NMR samples. It also describes the NMR observation of spinor
behavior in spin 1/2 nuclei, the simulation of wave function collapse using a
magnetic field gradient, the creation of entangled (or Bell) pseudo-pure
states, and a brief discussion of quantum computing logic gates, including the
Quantum Fourier Transform. These experiments show that liquid-state NMR can be
used to demonstrate quantum dynamics at a level suitable for laboratory
exercises.
