Distortion of a Phase Space Under the Darboux Transformation
The Darboux transformation operator technique is applied to construct exactly
solvable anharmonic singular oscillator potentials and to study their coherent
states. Classical system corresponding to a transformed quantum system is
constructed with the help of the coherent states technique. It is shown that at
classical level the Darboux transformation may be treated as a transformation
of K\"ahler potential which leads to a distortion of the initial phase space.
