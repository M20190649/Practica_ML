Nonperiodic Orbit Sums in Weyl's Expansion for Billiards
Weyl's expansion for the asymptotic mode density of billiards consists of the
area, length, curvature and corner terms. The area term has been associated
with the so-called zero-length orbits. Here closed nonperiodic paths
corresponding to the length and corner terms are constructed.
