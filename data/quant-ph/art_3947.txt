Quantum Jumps on a Circle
It is demonstrated that in contrast to the well-known case with a quantum
particle moving freely in a real line, the wave packets corresponding to the
coherent states for a free quantum particle on a circle do not spread but
develop periodically in time. The discontinuous changes during the course of
time in the phase representing the position of a particle can be interpreted as
the quantum jumps on a circle.
