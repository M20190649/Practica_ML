Quantum arrival time measurement and backflow effect
The current density for a freely evolving state without negative momentum
components can temporarily be negative. The operational arrival time
distribution, defined by the absorption rate of an ideal detector, is
calculated for a model detector and compared with recently proposed
distributions. Counterintuitive features of the backflow regime are discussed.
