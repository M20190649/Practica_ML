Causality and Nonlocality as Axioms for Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics permits nonlocality - both nonlocal correlations and
nonlocal equations of motion - while respecting relativistic causality. Is
quantum mechanics the unique theory that reconciles nonlocality and causality?
We consider two models, going beyond quantum mechanics, of nonlocality:
"superquantum" correlations, and nonlocal "jamming" of correlations. These
models are consistent with some definitions of nonlocality and causality.
