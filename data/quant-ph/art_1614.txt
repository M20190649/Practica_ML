Optimized perturbation method for the propagation in the anharmonic
  oscillator potential
The application of the optimized expansion for the quantum-mechanical
propagation in the anharmonic potential $\lambda x^4$ is discussed for real and
imaginary time. The first order results in the imaginary time formalism provide
approximations to the free energy and particle density which agree well with
the exact results in the whole range of temperatures.
