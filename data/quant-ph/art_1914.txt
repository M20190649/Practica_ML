Laser Induced Condensation of Trapped Bosonic Gases
We demonstrate that an appropriate sequence of laser pulses allows to
condense a gas of trapped bosonic atoms into an arbitrary trap level.
  Such condensation is robust, can be achieved in experimentally feasible
traps, and may lead to multistability and hysteresis phenomena.
