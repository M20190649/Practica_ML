Generalised Heisenberg Relations
A geometric framework for quantum statistical estimation is used to establish
a series of higher order corrections to the Heisenberg uncertainty relations
associated with pairs of canonically conjugate variables. These corrections can
be expressed in terms of linear combinations of higher order cumulants for the
distributions, and thus vanish for Gaussian distributions. Estimates for
typical numerical values arising from these corrections are indicated in the
case of a gamma distribution.
