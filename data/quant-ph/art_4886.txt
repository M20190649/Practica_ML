Thermal and quantum noise in active systems
We present a quantum network approach to the treatment of thermal and quantum
fluctuations in measurement devices. The measurement is described as a
scattering process of input fluctuations towards output ones. We present the
results obtained with this method for the treatment of a cold damped capacitive
accelerometer.
