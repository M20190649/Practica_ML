Canonical Quantum Teleportation
Canonically conjugated observables such as position-momentum and phase-number
are found to play a 3-fold role in the drama of the quantum teleportation.
Firstly, the common eigenstate of two commuting canonical observables like
phase-difference and number-sum provides the quantum channel between two
systems. Secondly, a similar pair of canonical observables from another two
systems is measured in the Bell operator measurements.
