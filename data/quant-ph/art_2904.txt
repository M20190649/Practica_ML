Separability in 2xN composite quantum systems
We analyze the separability properties of density operators supported on
$\C^2\otimes \C^N$ whose partial transposes are positive operators. We show
that if the rank of $\rho$ equals N then it is separable, and that bound
entangled states have rank larger than N. We also give a separability criterion
for a generic density operator such that the sum of its rank and the one of its
partial transpose does not exceed 3N. If it exceeds this number we show that
one can subtract product vectors until decreasing it to 3N, while keeping the
positivity of $\rho$ and its partial transpose. This automatically gives us a
sufficient criterion for separability for general density operators. We also
prove that all density operators that remain invariant after partial
transposition with respect to the first system are separable.
