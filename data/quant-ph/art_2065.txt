A New Interpretation of Quantum Theory -- Time as Hidden Variable
Using 2 more time variables as the quantum hidden variables, we derive the
equation of Dirac field under the principle of classical physics, then we
extend our method into the quantum fields with arbitrary spin number. The spin
of particle is shown naturally as the topological property of 3-dimensional
time + 3-dimensional space . One will find that the quantum physics of single
particle can be interpreted as the behavior of the single particle in 3+3
time-space .
