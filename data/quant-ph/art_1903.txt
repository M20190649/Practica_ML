Maximally entangled states and the Bell inequality
Kar's recent proof showing that a maximally entangled state of two spin-1/2
particles gives the largest violation of a Bell inequality is extended to N
spin-1/2 particles (with N greater than or equal to 3). In particular, it is
shown that all the states yielding a direct contradiction with the assumption
of local realism do generally consist of a superposition of maximally entangled
states.
