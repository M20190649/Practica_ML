Motion of a particle and the vacuum
We propose the deterministic dynamics of a free particle in a physical
vacuum, which is considered as a discrete (quantum) medium. The motion of the
particle is studied taking into account its interactions with the medium. It is
assumed that this interaction results in the appearance of special virtual
excitations, called "inertons," in the vacuum medium in the surroundings of the
canonical particle. The solution of the equation of motion shows that a cloud
of inertons oscillates around the particle with amplitude $\Lambda=\lambda
v/c$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, v is the initial velocity
of the particle, and c is the initial velocity of the inertons (velocity of
light). This oscillating nature of motion is also applied to the particle, and
the de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$ becomes the amplitude of spacial
oscillations. The oscillation frequency $\nu$ is given by the relation
$E=h\nu$. The connection of the present model with orthodox nonrelativistic
wave mechanics is analyzed.
