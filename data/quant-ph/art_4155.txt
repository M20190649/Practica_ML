Observation of Image Transfer and Phase Conjugation in Stimulated
  Down-Conversion
We observe experimentally the transfer of angular spectrum and image
formation in the process of stimulated parametric down-conversion. Images and
interference patterns can be transferred either from the pump or the auxiliary
laser beams to the stimulated down-converted one. The stimulated field
propagates as the complex conjugate of the auxiliary laser. The phase
conjugation is observed through intensity pattern measurements.
