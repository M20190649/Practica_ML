Quantum Interferometry, Measurement and Objectivity: Some Basic Features
  Revisited
The reduction paradigm of quantum interferometry and the objectivation
problem in quantum measurements are reanalyzed. Both are shown to be amenable
to straightforward mathematical treatment within "every-users" simple-minded
quantum mechanics without reduction postulate etc., using only its
probabilistic content.
