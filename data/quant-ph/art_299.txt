A Model Of The Integer Quantum Hall Effect
We discuss a model for the integer quantum Hall effect which is based on a
Schroedinger-Chern-Simons-action functional for a non-interacting system of
electrons in an electromagnetic field on a mutiply connected manifold. In this
model the integer values of the Hall conductivity arises in view of the
quantization of the Chern-Simons-action functional for electromagnetic
potential.
