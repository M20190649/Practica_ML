Atom optical elements for Bose condensates
A simple model for atom optical elements for Bose condensate of trapped,
dilute alkali atomns is proposed and numerical simulations are presented to
illustrate its characteristics. We demonstrate ways of focusing and splitting
the condensate by modifying experimentally adjustable parameters. We show that
there are at least two ways of implementing atom optical elements: one may
modulate the interatomic scattering length in space, or alternatively, use a
sinusoidal, externally applied potential.
