Teleportation of general quantum states
Quantum teleportation has been introduced by Benett et al. and dis cussed by
a number of authors in the framework of the singlet state. Recentl y, a
rigorous formulation of the teleportation problem of arbitrary quantum states
by means of quantum channel was given in [IOS] based on the general c hannel
theoretical formulation of the quantum gates introduced in [OW]. In t his note
we discuss a generalization of the scheme proposed in [IOS] and we give a
general method to solve the teleportation problem in spaces of arbitr ary
finite dimensions.
