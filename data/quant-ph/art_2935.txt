Multiqubit Spin
It is proposed that the state space of a quantum object with a complicated
discrete spectrum can be used as a basis for multiqubit recording and
processing of information in a quantum computer. As an example, nuclear spin
3/2 is considered. The possibilities of writing and reading two quantum bits of
information, preparation of the initial state, implementation of the "rotation"
and "controlled negation" operations, which are sufficient for constructing any
algorithms, are demonstrated.
