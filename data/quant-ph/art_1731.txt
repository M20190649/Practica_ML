Quantum Cryptography with Imperfect Apparatus
Quantum key distribution, first proposed by Bennett and Brassard, provides a
possible key distribution scheme whose security depends only on the quantum
laws of physics. So far the protocol has been proved secure even under channel
noise and detector faults of the receiver, but is vulnerable if the photon
source used is imperfect. In this paper we propose and give a concrete design
for a new concept, {\it self-checking source}, which requires the manufacturer
of the photon source to provide certain tests; these tests are designed such
that, if passed, the source is guaranteed to be adequate for the security of
the quantum key distribution protocol, even though the testing devices may not
be built to the original specification. The main mathematical result is a
structural theorem which states that, for any state in a Hilbert space, if
certain EPR-type equations are satisfied, the state must be essentially the
orthogonal sum of EPR pairs.
