Scalable programmable quantum gates and a new aspect of the additivity
  problem for the classical capacity of quantum channels
We consider two apparently separated problems: in the first part of the paper
we study the concept of a scalable (approximate) programmable quantum gate
(SPQG). These are special (approximate) programmable quantum gates, with nice
properties that could have implications on the theory of universal computation.
Unfortunately, as we prove, such objects do not exist in the domain of usual
quantum theory. In the second part the problem of noisy dense coding (and
generalizations) is addressed. We observe that the additivity problem for the
classical capacity obtained is of apparently greater generality than for the
usual quantum channel (completely positive maps): i.e., the latter occurs as a
special case of the former, but, as we shall argue with the help of the
non-existence result of the first part, the former cannot be reduced to an
instance of the latter. We conclude by suggesting that the additivity problem
for the classical capacity of quantum channels, as posed until now, may
conceptually not be in its appropriate generality.
