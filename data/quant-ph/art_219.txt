Remarks on Consistent Histories and Bohmian Mechanics
Recent work with Dowker on the scientific status of the consistent histories
approach to quantum theory is reviewed and summarised. The approach is compared
with formulations of quantum theory, such as Bohmian mechanics and the
Copenhagen interpretation a la Landau-Lifshitz, in which classical variables
are explicitly appended. I try to explain why the consistent histories
formulation is scientifically problematic, in that it is a very weak theory,
but also scientifically interesting, shedding new light on quantum theory.
