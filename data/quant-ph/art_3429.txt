Variational Approach to Hydrogen Atom in Uniform Magnetic Field of
  Arbitrary Strength
Extending the Feynman-Kleinert variational approach, we calculate the
temperature-dependent effective classical potential governing the quantum
statistics of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic at all temperatures. The
zero-temperature limit yields the binding energy of the electron which is quite
accurate for all magnetic field strengths and exhibits, in particular, the
correct logarithmic growth at large fields.
