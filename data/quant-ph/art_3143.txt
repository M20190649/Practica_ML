Operator monotones, the reduction criterion and the relative entropy
We introduce the theory of operator monotone functions and employ it to
derive a new inequality relating the quantum relative entropy and the quantum
conditional entropy. We present applications of this new inequality and in
particular we prove a new lower bound on the relative entropy of entanglement
and other properties of entanglement measures.
