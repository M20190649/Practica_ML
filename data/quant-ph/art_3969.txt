Understanding quantum effects from classical principles
Dynamics of a particle is formulated from classical principles that are
amended by the uncertainty principle. Two best known quantum effects:
interference and tunneling are discussed from these principles. It is shown
that identical to quantum results are obtained by solving only classical
equations of motion. Within the context of interference Aharonov-Bohm effect is
solved as a local action of magnetic force on the particle. On the example of
tunneling it is demonstrated how uncertainty principle amends traditional
classical mechanics: it allows the momentum of the particle to change without
the force being the cause of it.
