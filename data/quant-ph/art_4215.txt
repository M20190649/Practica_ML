Superfluidity in the stochastic limit
In the present paper we outline the stochastic limit approach to
superfluidity. The Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the Bose
condensate and the normal phase is introduced. Sufficient in the stochastic
limit condition of superfluidity is proposed. Existence of superfluidity in the
stochastic limit of this system is proved and the non-linear (quadratic)
equation of motion describing the superfluid liquid is obtained.
