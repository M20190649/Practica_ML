Entropy of phase measurement: Quantum phase via quadrature measurement
The content of phase information of an arbitrary phase--sensitive measurement
is evaluated using the maximum likelihood estimation. The phase distribution is
characterized by the relative entropy--a nonlinear functional of input quantum
state. As an explicit example the multiple measurement of quadrature operator
is interpreted as quantum phase detection achieving the ultimate resolution
predicted by the Fisher information.
