Information, disturbance and Hamiltonian quantum feedback control
We consider separating the problem of designing Hamiltonian quantum feedback
control algorithms into a measurement (estimation) strategy and a feedback
(control) strategy, and consider optimizing desirable properties of each under
the minimal constraint that the available strength of both is limited. This
motivates concepts of information extraction and disturbance which are distinct
from those usually considered in quantum information theory. Using these
concepts we identify an information trade-off in quantum feedback control.
