High-Temperature Expansions of Bures and Fisher Information Priors
For certain infinite and finite-dimensional thermal systems, we obtain ---
incorporating quantum-theoretic considerations into Bayesian thermostatistical
investigations of Lavenda --- high-temperature expansions of priors over
inverse temperature beta induced by volume elements ("quantum Jeffreys' priors)
of Bures metrics. Similarly to Lavenda's results based on volume elements
(Jeffreys' priors) of (classical) Fisher information metrics, we find that in
the limit beta -> 0, the quantum-theoretic priors either conform to Jeffreys'
rule for variables over [0,infinity], by being proportional to 1/beta, or to
the Bayes-Laplace principle of insufficient reason, by being constant. Whether
a system adheres to one rule or to the other appears to depend upon its number
of degrees of freedom.
