A delayed-choice thought-experiment with later-time entanglement
It is possible to find the nonlocality type of correlations between particle
pairs retrospectively, matched with the outcomes of a future entangling
measurement. But this does not imply nonlocality in subensembles of product
pairs, nor does it imply an influence propagating backwards in time.
