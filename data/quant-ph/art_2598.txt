Decoherence-Free Subspaces for Multiple-Qubit Errors: (I)
  Characterization
Coherence in an open quantum system is degraded through its interaction with
a bath. This decoherence can be avoided by restricting the dynamics of the
system to special decoherence-free subspaces. These subspaces are usually
constructed under the assumption of spatially symmetric system-bath coupling.
Here we show that decoherence-free subspaces may appear without spatial
symmetry. Instead, we consider a model of system-bath interactions in which to
first order only multiple-qubit coupling to the bath is present, with
single-qubit system-bath coupling absent. We derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for the appearance of decoherence-free states in this model, and
give a number of examples. In a sequel paper we show how to perform universal
and fault tolerant quantum computation on the decoherence-free subspaces
considered in this paper.
