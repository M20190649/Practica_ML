From quantum-codemaking to quantum code-breaking
This is a semi-popular overview of quantum entanglement as an important
physical resource in the field of data security and quantum computing. After a
brief outline of entanglement's key role in philosophical debates about the
meaning of quantum mechanics I describe its current impact on both cryptography
and cryptanalysis. The paper is based on the lecture given at the conference
"Geometric Issues in the Foundations of Science" (Oxford, June 1996) in honor
of Roger Penrose.
