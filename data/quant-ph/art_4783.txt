How unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is possible
Bit commitment involves the submission of evidence from one party to another
so that the evidence can be used to confirm a later revealed bit value by the
first party, while the second party cannot determine the bit value from the
evidence alone. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit
commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is
codified in a general impossibility theorem. In this paper, the scope of this
general impossibility proof is analyzed, and gaps are found. Two variants of a
bit commitment scheme utilizing anonymous quantum states and decoy states are
presented. In the first variant, the exact verifying measurement is independent
of the committed bit value, thus the second party can make it before the first
party opens, making possible an unconditional security proof based on
no-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because
quantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol
determinate. Whether impossibility holds in this or similar protocols is an
open question, although preliminary results already show that the impossibility
proof cannot work as it stands.
