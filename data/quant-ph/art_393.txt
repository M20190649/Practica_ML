Quantum Key Distribution and String Oblivious Transfer in Noisy Channels
We prove the unconditional security of a quantum key distribution (QKD)
protocol on a noisy channel against the most general attack allowed by quantum
physics. We use the fact that in a previous paper we have reduced the proof of
the unconditionally security of this QKD protocol to a proof that a
corresponding Quantum String Oblivious Transfer (String-QOT) protocol would be
unconditionally secure against Bob if implemented on top of an unconditionally
secure bit commitment scheme. We prove a lemma that extends a security proof
given by Yao for a (one bit) QOT protocol to this String-QOT protocol. This
result and the reduction mentioned above implies the unconditional security of
our QKD protocol despite our previous proof that unconditionally secure bit
commitment schemes are impossible.
