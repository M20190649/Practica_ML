Entanglement molecules
We investigate the entanglement properties of multiparticle systems,
concentrating on the case where the entanglement is robust against disposal of
particles. Two qubits -belonging to a multipartite system- are entangled in
this sense iff their reduced density matrix is entangled. We introduce a family
of multiqubit states, for which one can choose for any pair of qubits
independently whether they should be entangled or not as well as the relative
strength of the entanglement, thus providing the possibility to construct all
kinds of ''Entanglement molecules''. For some particular configurations, we
also give the maximal amount of entanglement achievable.
