Quantum state estimation
New algorithm for quantum state estimation based on the maximum likelihood
estimation is proposed. Existing techniques for state reconstruction based on
the inversion of measured data are shown to be overestimated since they do not
guarantee the positive definiteness of the reconstructed density matrix.
