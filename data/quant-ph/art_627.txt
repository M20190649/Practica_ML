Proof of Kolmogorovian Censorship
Many argued (Accardi and Fedullo, Pitowsky) that Kolmogorov's axioms of
classical probability theory are incompatible with quantum probabilities, and
this is the reason for the violation of Bell's inequalities. Szab\'o showed
that, in fact, these inequalities are not violated by the experimentally
observed frequencies if we consider the real, ``effective'' frequencies. We
prove in this work a theorem which generalizes this result: ``effective''
frequencies associated to quantum events always admit a Kolmogorovian
representation, when these events are collected through different experimental
set ups, the choice of which obeys a classical distribution.
