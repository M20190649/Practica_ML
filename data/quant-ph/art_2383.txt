The Best Copenhagen Tunneling Times
Recently, people have caculated tunneling's characteristic times within
Bohmian mechanics. Contrary to some characteristic times defined within the
framework of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, these have
reasonable values. Here, we introduce one of available definitions for
tunnelling's characteristic times within the standard interpretation as the
best definition that can be accepted for the tunneling times. We show that, due
to experimental limitations, Bohmian mechanics leads to same tunneling times.
