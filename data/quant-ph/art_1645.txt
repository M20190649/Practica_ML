Heisenberg picture operators in the stochastic wave function approach to
  open quantum systems
A fast simulation algorithm for the calculation of multitime correlation
functions of open quantum systems is presented. It is demonstrated that any
stochastic process which ``unravels'' the quantum Master equation can be used
for the calculation of matrix elements of reduced Heisenberg picture operators,
and thus for the calculation of multitime correlation functions, by extending
the stochastic process to a doubled Hilbert space. The numerical performance of
the stochastic simulation algorithm is investigated by means of a standard
example.
