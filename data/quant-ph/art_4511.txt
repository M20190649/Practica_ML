Conditional quantum dynamics with several observers
We consider several observers who monitor different parts of the environment
of a single quantum system and use their data to deduce its state. We derive a
set of conditional stochastic master equations that describe the evolution of
the density matrices each observer ascribes to the system under the Markov
approximation, and show that this problem can be reduced to the case of a
single "super-observer", who has access to all the acquired data. The key
problem - consistency of the sets of data acquired by different observers - is
then reduced to the probability that a given combination of data sets will be
ever detected by the "super-observer". The resulting conditional master
equations are applied to several physical examples: homodyne detection of
phonons in quantum Brownian motion, photo-detection and homodyne detection of
resonance fluorescence from a two-level atom. We introduce {\it relative
purity} to quantify the correlations between the information about the system
gathered by different observers from their measurements of the environment. We
find that observers gain the most information about the state of the system and
they agree the most about it when they measure the environment observables with
eigenstates most closely correlated with the optimally predictable {\it pointer
basis} of the system.
