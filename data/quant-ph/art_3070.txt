Algebra, Logic and Qubits: Quantum Abacus
The canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) for fermion systems can be
represented by finite-dimensional matrix algebra, but it is impossible for
canonical commutation relations (CCR) for bosons. After description of more
simple case with representation of CAR and (bounded) quantum computational
networks via Clifford algebras in the paper are discussed CCR. For
representation of the algebra it is not enough to use quantum networks with
fixed number of qubits and it is more convenient to consider Turing machine
with essential operation of appending new cells for description of infinite
tape in finite terms --- it has straightforward generalization for quantum
case, but for CCR it is necessary to work with symmetrized version of the
quantum Turing machine. The system is called here quantum abacus due to
understanding analogy with the ancient counting devices (abacus).
