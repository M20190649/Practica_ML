Semiclassical Approximations in Phase Space with Coherent States
We present a complete derivation of the semiclassical limit of the coherent
state propagator in one dimension, starting from path integrals in phase space.
We show that the arbitrariness in the path integral representation, which
follows from the overcompleteness of the coherent states, results in many
different semiclassical limits. We explicitly derive two possible semiclassical
formulae for the propagator, we suggest a third one, and we discuss their
relationships. We also derive an initial value representation for the
semiclassical propagator, based on an initial gaussian wavepacket. It turns out
to be related to, but different from, Heller's thawed gaussian approximation.
It is very different from the Herman--Kluk formula, which is not a correct
semiclassical limit. We point out errors in two derivations of the latter.
Finally we show how the semiclassical coherent state propagators lead to
WKB-type quantization rules and to approximations for the Husimi distributions
of stationary states.
