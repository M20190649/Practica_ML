On Some Peculiarities of Solving Nonstationary Problems of Quantum
  Mechanics
Exact solutions of several nonstationary problems of quantum mechanics are
obtained. It is shown that if the initial conditions of the problem correspond
to the localized-in-space particle, then it moves exactly along the classical
trajectory, and the wave packet is not spread in time.
