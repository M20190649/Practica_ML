Quantum Computing and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Quantum information processing is the use of inherently quantum mechanical
phenomena to perform information processing tasks that cannot be achieved using
conventional classical information technologies. One famous example is quantum
computing, which would permit calculations to be performed that are beyond the
reach of any conceivable conventional computer. Initially it appeared that
actually building a quantum computer would be extremely difficult, but in the
last few years there has been an explosion of interest in the use of techniques
adapted from conventional liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
experiments to build small quantum computers. After a brief introduction to
quantum computing I will review the current state of the art, describe some of
the topics of current interest, and assess the long term contribution of NMR
studies to the eventual implementation of practical quantum computers capable
of solving real computational problems.
