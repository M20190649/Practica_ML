Solution of the Deutsch-Josza Problem by NMR Ensemble Computing without
  Sensitivity Scaling
Experimental NMR implementations of the Deutsch-Josza quantum algorithm based
on pesudo-pure spin states exhibit an exponential sensitivity scaling with the
number of qubits. By employing truly mixed spin states in spin Liouville space,
where molecules with different nuclear spin configurations represent different
input states, the Deutsch-Josza problem can be solved by single function
evaluation without sensitivity loss concomitant with increase of the number of
bits.
