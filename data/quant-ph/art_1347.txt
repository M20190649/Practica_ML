Maximal Accuracy and Minimal Disturbance in the Arthurs-Kelly
  Simultaneous Measurement Process
The accuracy of the Arthurs-Kelly model of a simultaneous measurement of
position and momentum is analysed using concepts developed by Braginsky and
Khalili in the context of measurements of a single quantum observable. A
distinction is made between the errors of retrodiction and prediction. It is
shown that the distribution of measured values coincides with the initial state
Husimi function when the retrodictive accuracy is maximised, and that it is
related to the final state anti-Husimi function (the P representation of
quantum optics) when the predictive accuracy is maximised. The disturbance of
the system by the measurement is also discussed. A class of minimally
disturbing measurements is characterised. It is shown that the distribution of
measured values then coincides with one of the smoothed Wigner functions
described by Cartwright.
