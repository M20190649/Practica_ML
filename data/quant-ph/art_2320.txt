Entanglement-assisted local manipulation of pure quantum states
We demonstrate that local transformations on a composite quantum system can
be enhanced in the presence of certain entangled states. These extra states act
much like catalysts in a chemical reaction: they allow otherwise impossible
local transformations to be realised, without being consumed in any way. In
particular, we show that this effect can considerably improve the efficiency of
entanglement concentration procedures for finite states.
