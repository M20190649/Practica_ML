Structure behind Mechanics I: Foundation
This paper proposes a basic theory on physical reality and a new foundation
for quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. It presents a scenario not only
to solve the problem of the arbitrariness on the operator ordering for the
quantization procedure, but also to clarify how the classical-limit occurs.
This paper is the first of the three papers into which the previous paper
quant-ph/9906130 has been separated for readability.
