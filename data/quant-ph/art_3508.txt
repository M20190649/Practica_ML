Optimal universal two-particle entanglement processes in arbitrary
  dimensional Hilbert spaces
Universal two-particle entanglement processes are analyzed in arbitrary
dimensional Hilbert spaces. On the basis of this analysis the class of possible
optimal universal entanglement processes is determined whose resulting output
states do not contain any separable states. It is shown that these processes
form a one-parameter family. For all Hilbert space dimensions larger than two
the resulting optimally entangled output states are mixtures of anti-symmetric
states which are freely entangled and which also preserve information about
input states. Within this one-parameter family there is only one process by
which all information about any input state is destroyed completely.
