Polynomial procedure of avoiding multiqubit errors arising due to
  qubit-qubit interaction
Recently proposed implementations of quantum computer suffer from unavoidable
interaction between quantum bits depending upon data being written in them.
Novel procedure of avoiding multiqubit errors arising due to uncontrollable
qubit-qubit interaction by using addititonal intermediate qubits is proposed.
It is shown that the scheme requires only polynomial increase in number of
qubits and algorithmic steps.
