Bell's inequalities, multiphoton states and phase space distributions
The connection between quantum optical nonclassicality and the violation of
Bell's inequalities is explored. Bell type inequalities for the electromagnetic
field are formulated for general states of quantised radiation and their
violation is connected to other nonclassical properties of the field. This is
achieved by considering states with an arbitrary number of photons and
carefully identifying the hermitian operators whose expectation values do not
admit any local hidden variable description. We relate the violation of these
multi-photon inequalities to properties of phase space distribution functions
such as the diagonal coherent state distribution function and the Wigner
function. Finally, the family of 4-mode states with Gaussian Wigner
distributions is analysed, bringing out in this case the connection of
violation of Bell type inequalities with the nonclassical property of
squeezing.
