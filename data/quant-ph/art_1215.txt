Quantum radiation in external background fields
A canonical formalism is presented which allows for investigations of quantum
radiation induced by localized, smooth disturbances of classical background
fields by means of a perturbation theory approach. For massless,
non-selfinteracting quantum fields at zero temperature we demonstrate that the
low-energy part of the spectrum of created particles exhibits a non-thermal
character. Applied to QED in varying dielectrics the response theory approach
facilitates to study two distinct processes contributing to the production of
photons: the squeezing effect due to space-time varying properties of the
medium and of the velocity effect due to its motion. The generalization of this
approach to finite temperatures as well as the relation to sonoluminescence is
indicated.
