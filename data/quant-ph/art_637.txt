Quantum Theory of Computation and Relativistic Physics
In the e-print is discussed a few steps to introducing of "vocabulary" of
relativistic physics in quantum theory of information and computation (QTI&C).
The behavior of a few simple quantum systems those are used as models in QTI&C
is tested by usual relativistic tools (transformation properties of wave
vectors, etc.). Massless and charged massive particles with spin 1/2 are
considered. Field theory is also discussed briefly.
