Experimental study of a photon as a subsystem of an entangled two-photon
  state
The state of the signal-idler photon pair of spontaneous parametric down
conversion(SPDC) is a typical nonlocal entangled pure state with zero entropy.
The precise correlation of the subsystems is completely described by the state.
However, it is an experimental choice to study only one subsystem and to ignore
the other. What can we learn about the measured subsystem and the remaining
parts? Results of this kind of measurements look peculiar. The experiment
confirms that the two subsystems are both in mixed states with entropy greater
than zero. One can only obtain statistical knowledge of the subsystems in this
kind of measurement.
