Uncertainty is complementary to Complementarity
For any ideal two-path interferometer it is shown that the wave-particle
duality of quantum mechanics implies Heisenberg's uncertainty relation and vice
versa. It is conjectured that complementarity and uncertainty are two aspects
of the same general principle.
