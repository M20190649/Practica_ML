The lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate quantum computers
We show that the lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate quantum Turing
machines by showing how the lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate a class
of quantum cellular automaton that are equivalent to quantum Turing machines.
We conclude by noting that the lambda-q calculus may be strictly stronger than
quantum computers because NP-complete problems such as satisfiability are
efficiently solvable in the lambda-q calculus but there is a widespread doubt
that they are efficiently solvable by quantum computers.
