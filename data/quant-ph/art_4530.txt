Entanglement teleportation via Bell Mixture
We investigate the teleportation of the bipartite entangled states through
two equally noisy quantum channels, namely mixture of Bell states. There is a
particular mixed state channel for which all pure entanglement in a known
Schmidt basis remain entangled after teleportation and it happens till the
channel state remains entangled. Werner state channel lacks both these
features. The relation of these noisy channels with violation of Bell's
inequality and 2-E inequality is studied.
