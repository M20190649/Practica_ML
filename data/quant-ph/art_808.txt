Origin of quantum randomness in the pilot wave quantum mechanics
We account for the origin of the laws of quantum probabilities in the de
Broglie-Bohm (pilot wave) formulation of quantum theory by considering the
property of ergodicity likely to characterise the dynamics of microscopic
quantum systems.
