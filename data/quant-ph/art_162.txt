Global existence and uniqueness of Bohmian trajectories
It is shown that Bohmian mechanics is internally consistent in the sense that
the equations of motion typically have global solutions despite the fact that
the velocity field is singular at the nodes of the wave function and at other
points. This result is fundamental for the derivation of the quantum formalism.
The role of the quantum flux is emphasized.
