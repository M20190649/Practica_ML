Dense Antihydrogen: Its Production and Storage to Envision Antimatter
  Propulsion
We discuss the possibility that dense antihydrogen could provide a path
towards a mechanism for a deep space propulsion system. We concentrate at
first, as an example, on Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) antihydrogen. In a
Bose-Einstein Condensate, matter (or antimatter) is in a coherent state
analogous to photons in a laser beam, and individual atoms lose their
independent identity. This allows many atoms to be stored in a small volume. In
the context of recent advances in producing and controlling BECs, as well as in
making antihydrogen, this could potentially provide a revolutionary path
towards the efficient storage of large quantities of antimatter, perhaps
eventually as a cluster or solid.
