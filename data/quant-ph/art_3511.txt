Hidden-variable theorems for real experiments
It has recently been questioned whether the Kochen-Specker theorem is
relevant to real experiments, which by necessity only have finite precision. We
give an affirmative answer to this question by showing how to derive
hidden-variable theorems that apply to real experiments, so that non-contextual
hidden variables can indeed be experimentally disproved. The essential point is
that for the derivation of hidden-variable theorems one does not have to know
which observables are really measured by the apparatus. Predictions can be
derived for observables that are defined in an entirely operational way.
