Microscopic Foundation of Nonextensive Statistics
Combination of the Liouville equation with the q-averaged energy $U_q =
<H>_q$ leads to a microscopic framework for nonextensive q-thermodynamics. The
resulting von Neumann equation is nonlinear: $i\dot\rho=[H,\rho^q]$. In spite
of its nonlinearity the dynamics is consistent with linear quantum mechanics of
pure states. The free energy $F_q=U_q-TS_q$ is a stability function for the
dynamics. This implies that q-equilibrium states are dynamically stable. The
(microscopic) evolution of $\rho$ is reversible for any q, but for $q\neq 1$
the corresponding macroscopic dynamics is irreversible.
