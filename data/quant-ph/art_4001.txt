Spin squeezing in nonlinear spin coherent states
We introduce the nonlinear spin coherent state via its ladder operator
formalism and propose a type of nonlinear spin coherent state by the nonlinear
time evolution of spin coherent states. By a new version of spectroscopic
squeezing criteria we study the spin squeezing in both the spin coherent state
and nonlinear spin coherent state. The results show that the spin coherent
state is not squeezed in the x, y, and z directions, and the nonlinear spin
coherent state may be squeezed in the x and y directions.
