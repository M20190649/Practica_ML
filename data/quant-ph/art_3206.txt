Derivation of Standard Treatment of Spin Addition From Probability
  Amplitudes
In a recent paper, we introduced a new way of treating systems of compounded
angular momentum. We obtained the probability amplitudes for measurements on
the systems and used these to derive the matrix treatment of compounded spin.
However, the matrix forms are in 3- and 4- dimensional space and are therefore
entirely different from the standard forms. This raises the question of the
connection between these forms and the standard forms. In this paper, we answer
this question. We not only derive the standard matrix treatment of spin
addition - we discover a more generalized form of the theory. We apply the new
generalized theory to the singlet and triplet states arising from the addition
of the spins of two systems of spin 1/2 each. We obtain new generalized forms
of the vectors and operators for these cases, and show that they reduce to the
standard forms in the appropriate limit.
