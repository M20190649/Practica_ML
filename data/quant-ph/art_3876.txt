Implementation of a quantum phase gate by the optical Kerr effect
We show that the optical Kerr effect can be used to construct a quantum phase
gate. It is well known from quantum nondemolition techniques that, as two
photon field modes pass through a Kerr medium, the phase of each mode will be
shifted, and the size of the phase shift will depend on the number of photons
in both modes. We discuss the Hamiltonian responsible for this effect and show
how this can produce an effective photon-photon interaction which corresponds
to the quantum phase gate operating on two qubits each of which is represented
by the elliptical polarization of one photon field. We discuss decoherence and
losses and suggest some methods for dealing with them.
