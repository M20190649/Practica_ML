Consistent use of paradoxes in deriving constraints on the dynamics of
  physical systems and of no-go-theorems
The classical methods used by recursion theory and formal logic to block
paradoxes do not work in quantum information theory. Since quantum information
can exist as a coherent superposition of the classical ``yes'' and ``no''
states, certain tasks which are not conceivable in the classical setting can be
performed in the quantum setting. Classical logical inconsistencies do not
arise, since there exist fixed point states of the diagonalization operator. In
particular, closed timelike curves need not be eliminated in the quantum
setting, since they would not lead to any paradoxical outcome controllability.
Quantum information theory can also be subjected to the treatment of
inconsistent information in databases and expert systems. It is suggested that
any two pieces of contradicting information are stored and processed as
coherent superposition. In order to be tractable, this strategy requires
quantum computation.
