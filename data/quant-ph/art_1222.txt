The time of arrival concept in quantum mechanics
The concept and the formalization of the arrival time in quantum mechanics
are discussed. Different approaches based on trajectories, quantization rules,
time operators, phase space techniques, renewal equations or operational
procedures are reviewed or proposed. Open questions and loose ends are pointed
out.
