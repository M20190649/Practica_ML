Optimal compression for mixed signal states
We consider the problem of the optimal compression rate in the case of the
source producing mixed signal states within the {\it visible} scheme (where
Alice, who is to compress the signal, can know the identities of the produced
states). We show that a simple strategy based on replacing the signal states
with their {\it extensions} gives {\it optimal} compression. As a result we
obtain a considerable simplification of the formula for optimal compression
rate within visible scheme.
