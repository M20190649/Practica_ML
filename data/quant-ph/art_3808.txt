A puzzle in quantum dynamics
The textbook treatment in that the wave function of a dynamical system is
expanded in an eigenfunction series is investigated. With help of an elementary
example and some mathematical theorems, it is revealed that in terms of solving
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation the treatment involves in divergence
trouble . The root reason behind the trouble is finally analyzed.
