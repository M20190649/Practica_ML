Approximate quantum cloning and the impossibility of superluminal
  information transfer
We show that nonlocality of quantum mechanics cannot lead to superluminal
transmission of information, even if most general local operations are allowed,
as long as they are linear and trace preserving. In particular, any quantum
mechanical approximate cloning transformation does not allow signalling. On the
other hand, the no-signalling constraint on its own is not sufficient to
prevent a transformation from surpassing the known cloning bounds. We
illustrate these concepts on the basis of some examples.
