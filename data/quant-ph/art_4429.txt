Signal-Locality in Hidden-Variables Theories
We prove that all deterministic hidden-variables theories, that reproduce
quantum theory for a 'quantum equilibrium' distribution of hidden variables,
predict the existence of instantaneous signals at the statistical level for
hypothetical 'nonequilibrium ensembles'. This signal-locality theorem
generalises yet another property of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm. The theorem supports the hypothesis that in the remote past the universe
relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium (at the hidden-variable level) in
which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.
