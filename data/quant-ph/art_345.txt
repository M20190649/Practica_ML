Perfect quantum error correction coding in 24 laser pulses
An efficient coding circuit is given for the perfect quantum error correction
of a single qubit against arbitrary 1-qubit errors within a 5 qubit code. The
circuit presented employs a double `classical' code, i.e., one for bit flips
and one for phase shifts. An implementation of this coding circuit on an
ion-trap quantum computer is described that requires 26 laser pulses. A further
circuit is presented requiring only 24 laser pulses, making it an efficient
protection scheme against arbitrary 1-qubit errors. In addition, the
performance of two error correction schemes, one based on the quantum Zeno
effect and the other using standard methods, is compared. The quantum Zeno
error correction scheme is found to fail completely for a model of noise based
on phase-diffusion.
