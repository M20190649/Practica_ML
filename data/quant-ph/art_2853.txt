Nonlocal kinetic theory
The short time behavior of a disturbed system is influenced by off-shell
motion and best characterized by the reduced density matrix possessing high
energetic tails. We present analytically the formation of correlations due to
collisions in an interacting Fermionic system with and without initial
correlation. After this short time regime the time evolution is controlled by
small gradients. This leads to a nonlocal Boltzmann equation for the
quasiparticle distribution and a functional relating the latter one to the
reduced density matrix. The nonlocalities are presented as time and space
shifts arising from gradient expansion and are leading to virial corrections in
the thermodynamical limit.
