Quantum interference by two temporally distinguishable pulses
We report a two-photon interference effect, in which the entangled photon
pairs are generated from two laser pulses well-separated in time. In a single
pump pulse case, interference effects did not occur in our experimental scheme.
However, by introducing a second pump pulse delayed in time, quantum
interference was then observed. The visibility of the interference fringes
shows dependence on the delay time between two laser pulses. The results are
explained in terms of indistinguishability of biphoton amplitudes which
originated from two temporally separated laser pulses.
