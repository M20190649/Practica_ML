Prospects for photon blockade in four level systems in the N
  configuration with more than one atom
We show that for appropriate choices of parameters it is possible to achieve
photon blockade in idealised one, two and three atom systems. We also include
realistic parameter ranges for rubidium as the atomic species. Our results
circumvent the doubts cast by recent discussion in the literature (Grangier et
al Phys. Rev Lett. 81, 2833 (1998), Imamoglu et al Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2836
(1998)) on the possibility of photon blockade in multi-atom systems.
