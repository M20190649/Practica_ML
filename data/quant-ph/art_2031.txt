The linewidth of a non-Markovian atom laser
We present a fully quantum mechanical treatment of a single mode atom laser
including pumping and output coupling. By ignoring atom-atom interactions, we
have solved this model without making the Born-Markov approximation. We find
substantially less gain narrowing than is predicted under that approximation.
