A note on the supplementary variables in spin-measuring equipments in
  the EPR-Bell experiment
We discuss supplementary (or hidden) variables in spin-measuring equipments
in EPR-Bell experiment. This theme was considered in a Bell's later work. We
generalize it. First, we show why the original supplementary variable $\lambda$
is not to be regarded to include supplementary variables in spin-measuring
equipments (why supplementary variables should be introduced additionally in
spin-measuring equipments) Next, we show the followings. When the supplementary
variables introduced in spin-measuring equipments have local correlations, the
Bell inequality is recovered. On the other hand, when they have nonlocal
correlations, the Bell inequality is not recovered. This fact is in accord with
the fact that the Bell inequality is derived for local realistic models.
