Quantum Computation, Spectroscopy of Trapped Ions, and Schrodinger's Cat
We summarize efforts at NIST to implement quantum computation using trapped
ions, based on a scheme proposed by J.I. Cirac and P. Zoller (Innsbruck
University). The use of quantum logic to create entangled states, which can
maximize the quantum-limited signal-to-noise ratio in spectroscopy, is
discussed.
