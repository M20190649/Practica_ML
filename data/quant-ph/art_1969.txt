Quantum trajectories of interacting pseudo-spin-networks
We consider quantum trajectories of composite systems as generated by the
stochastic unraveling of the respective Lindblad-master-equation. Their
classical limit is taken to correspond to local jumps between orthogonal
states. Based on statistical distributions of jump- and inter-jump-distances we
are able to quantify the non-classicality of quantum trajectories. To account
for the operational effect of entanglement we introduce the novel concept of
"co-jumps".
