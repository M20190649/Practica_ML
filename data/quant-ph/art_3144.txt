Quantum Tomography Via Group Theory
Amongst the multitude of state reconstruction techniques, the so-called
"quantum tomography" seems to be the most fruitful. In this letter, I will
start by developing the mathematical apparatus of quantum tomography and,
later, I will explain how it can be applied to various quantum systems.
