Nelsonian Mechanics Revisited
In de Broglie and Bohm's pilot-wave theory, as is well known, it is possible
to consider alternative particle dynamics while still preserving the quantum
distribution. I present the analogous result for Nelson's stochastic theory,
thus characterising the most general diffusion processes that preserve the
quantum equilibrium distribution, and discuss the analogy with the construction
of the dynamics for Bell's beable theories. I briefly comment on the problem of
convergence to the quantum distribution and on possible experimental
constraints on the alternative dynamics.
