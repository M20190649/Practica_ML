Chaos in a double driven dissipative nonlinear oscillator
We propose an anharmonic oscillator driven by two periodic forces of
different frequencies as a new time-dependent model for investigating quantum
dissipative chaos. Our analysis is done in the frame of statistical ensemble of
quantum trajectories in quantum state diffusion approach. Quantum dynamical
manifestation of chaotic behavior, including the emergence of chaos, properties
of strange attractors, and quantum entanglement are studied by numerical
simulation of ensemble averaged Wigner function and von Neumann entropy.
