Quantum Games
In these lecture notes we investigate the implications of the identification
of strategies with quantum operations in game theory beyond the results
presented in [J. Eisert, M. Wilkens, and M. Lewenstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83,
3077 (1999)]. After introducing a general framework, we study quantum games
with a classical analogue in order to flesh out the peculiarities of game
theoretical settings in the quantum domain. Special emphasis is given to a
detailed investigation of different sets of quantum strategies.
