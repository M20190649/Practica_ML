Quantum cryptographic three party protocols
Due to the impossibility results of Mayers and Lo/Chau it is generally
thought that a quantum channel is cryptographically strictly weaker than
oblivious transfer. In this paper we prove that in a three party scenario a
quantum channel can be strictly stronger than oblivious transfer. With the
protocol introduced in this paper we can completely classify the cryptographic
strength of quantum multi party protocols.
