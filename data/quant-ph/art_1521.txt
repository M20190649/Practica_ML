New approach to Epsilon-entropy and Its comparison with Kolmogorov's
  Epsilon-entropy
Kolmogorov introduced a concept of Epsilon-entropy to analyze information in
classical continuous system. The fractal dimension of geometrical sets was
introduced by Mandelbrot as a new criterion to analyze the complexity of these
sets. The Epsilon-entropy and the fractal dimension of a state in general
quantum system were introduced by one of the present authors in order to
characterize chaotic properties of general states.
  In this paper, we show that Epsilon-entropy of a state includes Kolmogorov
Epsilon-entropy, and the fractal dimension of a state describe fractal
structure of Gaussian measures.
