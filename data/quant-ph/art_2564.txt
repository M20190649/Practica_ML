Quantum gates by coupled quantum dots and measurement procedure in Si
  MOSFET
We investigated the quantum gates of coupled quantum dots, theoretically,
when charging effects can be observed. We have shown that the charged states in
the qubits can be observed by the channel current of the MOSFET structure.
