Macroscopic Local Realism Incompatible with Quantum Mechanics: Failure
  of Local Realism where Measurements give Macroscopic Uncertainties
We show that quantum mechanics predicts a contradiction with local hidden
variable theories for photon number measurements which have limited resolving
power, to the point of imposing an uncertainty in the photon number result
which is macroscopic in absolute terms. We show how this can be interpreted as
a failure of a new premise, macroscopic local realism.
