Interacting Dark Resonances: Interference Effects Induced by Coherently
  Altered Quantum Superpositions
We predict the possibility of sharp, high-contrast resonances in the optical
response of a broad class of systems, wherein interference effects are
generated by coherent perturbation or interaction of dark states. The
properties of these resonances can be manipulated to design a desired atomic
response.
