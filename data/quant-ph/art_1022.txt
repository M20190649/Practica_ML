Quantum mechanics and elements of reality inferred from joint
  measurements
The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument on quantum mechanics incompleteness is
formulated in terms of elements of reality inferred from joint (as opposed to
alternative) measurements, in two examples involving entangled states of three
spin-1/2 particles. The same states allow us to obtain proofs of the
incompatibility between quantum mechanics and elements of reality.
