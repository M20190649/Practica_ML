Quantum Langevin theory of excess noise
In an earlier work [P. J. Bardroff and S. Stenholm], we have derived a fully
quantum mechanical description of excess noise in strongly damped lasers. This
theory is used here to derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equations.
Taking the semi-classical limit of these we are able to regain the starting
point of Siegman's treatment of excess noise [Phys. Rev. A 39, 1253 (1989)].
Our results essentially constitute a quantum derivation of his theory and allow
some generalizations.
