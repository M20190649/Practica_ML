Teleportation, Bell's Inequalities and Inseparability
Relations between teleportation, Bell's inequalities and inseparability are
investigated. It is shown that any mixed two spin-$1\over2$ state which
violates the Bell-CHSH inequality is useful for teleportation. The result is
extended to any Bell's inequalities constructed of the expectation values of
products of spin operators. It is also shown that there exist inseparable
states which are not useful for teleportation within the standard scheme.
