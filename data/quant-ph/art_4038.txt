Conditions for Nondistortion Interrogation of Quantum System
Under some physical considerations, we present a universal formulation to
study the possibility of localizing a quantum object in a given region without
disturbing its unknown internal state. When the interaction between the object
and probe wave function takes place only once, we prove the necessary and
sufficient condition that the object's presence can be detected in an initial
state preserving way. Meanwhile, a conditioned optimal interrogation
probability is obtained.
