Are quantum teleportation and cryptography predicted by quantum
  mechanics?
It has been shown that the predictions of some new phenomena (e.g.,
teleportation and cryptography) are based on some assumptions added to the
quantum-mechanical model or modifying some of its basic axioms. The hitherto
experiments presented as a support of the mentioned phenomena may be hardly
regarded as sufficient, as they may be interpreted alternatively on the basis
of simple interference processes.
