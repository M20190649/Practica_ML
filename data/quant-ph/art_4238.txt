Lossless quantum data compression and variable-length coding
In order to compress quantum messages without loss of information it is
necessary to allow the length of the encoded messages to vary. We develop a
general framework for variable-length quantum messages in close analogy to the
classical case and show that lossless compression is only possible if the
message to be compressed is known to the sender. The lossless compression of an
ensemble of messages is bounded from below by its von-Neumann entropy. We show
that it is possible to reduce the number of qbits passing through a quantum
channel even below the von-Neumann entropy by adding a classical side-channel.
We give an explicit communication protocol that realizes lossless and
instantaneous quantum data compression and apply it to a simple example. This
protocol can be used for both online quantum communication and storage of
quantum data.
