A Limit on the Speed of Quantum Computation in Determining Parity
Consider a function f which is defined on the integers from 1 to N and takes
the values -1 and +1. The parity of f is the product over all x from 1 to N of
f(x). With no further information about f, to classically determine the parity
of f requires N calls of the function f. We show that any quantum algorithm
capable of determining the parity of f contains at least N/2 applications of
the unitary operator which evaluates f. Thus for this problem, quantum
computers cannot outperform classical computers.
