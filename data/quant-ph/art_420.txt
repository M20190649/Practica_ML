Quantum measurement in a family of hidden-variable theories
The measurement process for hidden-configuration formulations of quantum
mechanics is analysed. It is shown how a satisfactory description of quantum
measurement can be given in this framework. The unified treatment of
hidden-configuration theories, including Bohmian mechanics and Nelson's
stochastic mechanics, helps in understanding the true reasons why the problem
of quantum measurement can succesfully be solved within such theories.
