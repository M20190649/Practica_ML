Error correction for continuous quantum variables
We propose an error correction coding algorithm for continuous quantum
variables. We use this algorithm to construct a highly efficient 5-wavepacket
code which can correct arbitrary single wavepacket errors. We show that this
class of continuous variable codes is robust against imprecision in the error
syndromes. A potential implemetation of the scheme is presented.
