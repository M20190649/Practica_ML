Wave Packet Echoes in the Motion of Trapped Atoms
We experimentally demonstrate and systematically study the stimulated revival
(echo) of motional wave packet oscillations. For this purpose, we prepare wave
packets in an optical lattice by non-adiabatically shifting the potential and
stimulate their reoccurence by a second shift after a variable time delay. This
technique, analogous to spin echoes, enables one even in the presence of strong
dephasing to determine the coherence time of the wave packets. We find that for
strongly bound atoms it is comparable to the cooling time and much longer than
the inverse of the photon scattering rate.
