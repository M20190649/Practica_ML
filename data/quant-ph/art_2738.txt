Optimal Quantum Cloning via Stimulated Emission
We show that optimal universal quantum cloning can be realized via stimulated
emission. Universality of the cloning procedure is achieved by choosing systems
that have appropriate symmetries. We first discuss a scheme based on stimulated
emission in certain three-level-systems, e.g. atoms in a cavity. Then we
present a way of realizing optimal universal cloning based on stimulated
parametric down-conversion. This scheme also implements the optimal universal
NOT operation.
