Quantum Teleportation and Beam Splitting
Following the previous paper in which quantum teleportation is rig orously
discussed with coherent entangled states given by beam splittings, we further
discuss two types of models, perfect teleportation model and non-perfect
teleportation model, in general scheme. Then the difference among several
models, i.e., the perfect models and the non-perfect models, is studied. Our
teleportation models are constructed by means of coherent states in some Fock
space with counting measures, so that our model can be treated in the frame of
usual optical communication.
