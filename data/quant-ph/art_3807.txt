Decomposition of Hilbert space in sets of coherent states
Within the generalized definition of coherent states as group orbits we study
the orbit spaces and the orbit manifolds in the projective spaces constructed
from linear representations. Invariant functions are suggested for arbitrary
groups. The group SU(2) is studied in particular and the orbit spaces of its
j=1/2 and j=1 representations completely determined. The orbits of SU(2) in
CP^N can be either 2 or 3 dimensional, the first of them being either
isomorphic to S^2 or to RP^2 and the latter being isomorphic to quotient spaces
of RP^3. We end with a look from the same perspective to the quantum mechanical
space of states in particle mechanics.
