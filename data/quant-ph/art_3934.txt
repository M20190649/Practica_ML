Nash Equilibrium in the Quantum Battle of Sexes Game
We investigate Nash Equilibrium in the quantum Battle of Sexes Game. We find
the game has infinite Nash Equilibria and all of them leads to the asymmetry
result. We also show that there is no unique but infinite Nash Equilibrium in
it if we use the quantizing scheme proposed by Eisert et al and the two players
are allowed to adopt any unitary operator as his/her strategies.
