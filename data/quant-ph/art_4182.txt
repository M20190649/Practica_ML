Separable approximation for mixed states of composite quantum systems
We describe a purely algebraic method for finding the best separable
approximation to a mixed state of a composite 2x2 quantum system, consisting of
a decomposition of the state into a linear combination of a mixed separable
part and a pure entangled one. We prove that, in a generic case, the weight of
the pure part in the decomposition equals the concurrence of the state.
