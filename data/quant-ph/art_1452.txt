Retrodictively Optimal Localisations in Phase Space
In a previous paper it was shown that the distribution of measured values for
a retrodictively optimal simultaneous measurement of position and momentum is
always given by the initial state Husimi function. This result is now
generalised to retrodictively optimal simultaneous measurements of an arbitrary
pair of rotated quadratures x_theta1 and x_theta2. It is shown, that given any
such measurement, it is possible to find another such measurement,
informationally equivalent to the first, for which the axes defined by the two
quadratures are perpendicular. It is further shown that the distribution of
measured values for such a meaurement belongs to the class of generalised
Husimi functions most recently discussed by Wuensche and Buzek. The class
consists of the subset of Wodkiewicz's operational probability distributions
for which the filter reference state is a squeezed vaccuum state.
