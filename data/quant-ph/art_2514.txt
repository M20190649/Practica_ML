Spin correlated interferometry for polarized and unpolarized photons on
  a beam splitter
Spin interferometry of the 4th order for independent polarized as well as
unpolarized photons arriving simultaneously at a beam splitter and exhibiting
spin correlation while leaving it, is formulated and discussed in the quantum
approach. Beam splitter is recognized as a source of genuine singlet photon
states. Also, typical nonclassical beating between photons taking part in the
interference of the 4th order is given a polarization dependent explanation.
