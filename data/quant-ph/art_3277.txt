Error Avoiding Quantum Codes and Dynamical Stabilization of Grover's
  Algorithm
An error avoiding quantum code is presented which is capable of stabilizing
Grover's quantum search algorithm against a particular class of coherent
errors. This error avoiding code consists of states only which are factorizable
in the computational basis. Furthermore, its redundancy is smaller than the one
which is achievable with a general error correcting quantum code saturating the
quantum Hamming bound. The fact that this code consists of factorizable states
only may offer advantages for the implementation of quantum gates in the error
free subspace.
