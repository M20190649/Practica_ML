Incompatibility of the de Broglie-Bohm Theory with Quantum Mechanics
t is shown that although the de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory of motion is
equivalent to standard quantum mechanics when averages of dynamical variables
are taken over a Gibbs ensemble of Bohmian trajectories, the equivalence breaks
down for ensembles built over clearly separated short intervals of time in
special multi-particle systems. This feature is exploited to propose a
realistic experiment to distinguish between the two theories.
