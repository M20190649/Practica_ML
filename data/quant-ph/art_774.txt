Equivalence between Bell's inequality and a constraint on stochastic
  field theories for EPR states
A generalized form of EPR state is defined, embracing both classical and
nonclassical states. It is shown that for such states, Bell's inequality is
equivalent to a constraint on stochastic field theories. Thus, violation of
Bell's inequality can be observed also for weak violation of stochastic field
theories. The Schrodinger cat state is shown to be an example of this.
