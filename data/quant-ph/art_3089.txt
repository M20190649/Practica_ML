Discrete Phase Measurements and the Bell inequality
We present a formulation of the Bell inequalities using simple correlated
photon number states and phase measurements. Such tests generally require
binning of the information, and this effect is closely examined. Our proposal
opens up the opportunity for a new novel test of quantum mechanics versus local
realism. Some insight in entanglement in such systems may be achieved.
