Generally relativistical Daffin-Kemmer formalis and behaviour of
  quantm-mechanical particle of spin 1 in the Abelian monopole field
It is shown that the manner of introducing theinteraction between a spin 1
particle and external classical gravitational field can be successfully uni-
fied with the approach that occurred with regard to a spin 1/2 particle and was
first developed by Tetrode, Weyl, Fock, Ivanenko. On that way a general- ly
relativistical Duffin-Kemmer equation is costructed. So, the manner of
extending the flat space Dirac equation to general relativity case indicates
clearly that the Lorentz group underlies equally both these theories. In other
words, the Lorentz group retains its importance and significance at changing
the Minkowski space model to an arbitrary curved space-time. In contrast to
this, at generalizing the Proca formulation, we automatically destroy any
relations to the Lorentz group, although the definition itself for a spin 1
particle as an elementary object was based on just this group. Such a gravity's
sensitiveness to the fermion-boson division might appear rather strange and
unattractive asymmetry, being subjected to the criticism. Moreover, just this
feature has brought about a plenty of speculation on this matter. In any case,
this peculiarity of particle-gravity field inter- action is recorded almost in
every handbook. In the paper, on the base of the Duffin-Kemmer formalism
developed, the problem of a vector particle in the Abelian monopole potential
is considered.
