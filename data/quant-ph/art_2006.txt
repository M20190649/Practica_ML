Inference of Planck action constant by a classical fluctuative postulate
  holding for stable microscopic and macroscopic dynamical systems
The possibility is discussed of inferring or simulating some aspects of
quantum dynamics by adding classical statistical fluctuations to classical
mechanics. We introduce a general principle of mechanical stability and derive
a necessary condition for classical chaotic fluctuations to affect confined
dynamical systems, on any scale, ranging from microscopic to macroscopic
domains. As a consequence we obtain, both for microscopic and macroscopic
aggregates, dimensional relations defining the minimum unit of action of
individual constituents, yielding in all cases Planck action constant.
