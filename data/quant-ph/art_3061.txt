Four Atomic Optical Energy Levels as a Two Qubit Quantum Computer
  Register
It is proposed to use four atomic optical energy levels as a two qubit
quantum register. A single Pr3+ atom in a monocrystal LaF3 subjected to
resonant laser irradiation is used as an example to illustrate the
implementation of the universal set of quantum gates. The equilibrium state of
this physical system is a desirable input state for quantum computation and
therefore there is no need for its special preparation procedure.
