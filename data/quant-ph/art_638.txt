Broadcasting of entanglement via local copying
We show that inseparability of quantum states can be partially broadcasted
(copied, cloned) with the help of local operations, i.e. distant parties
sharing an entangled pair of spin 1/2 states can generate two pairs of
partially nonlocally entangled states using only local operations. This
procedure can be viewed as an inversion of quantum purification procedures.
