Creating macroscopic atomic EPR states from Bose condensates
We present a scheme for creating quantum entangled atomic states through the
coherent spin-exchange collision of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The
state generated possesses macroscopic Einstein-Podolsky-Roson correlation and
the fluctuation in one of its quasi-spin components vanishes. We show that an
elongated condensate with large aspect ratio is most suitable for creating such
a state.
