Quantum Computing Using an Open System and Projected Subspace
Using the subdynamical kinetic equation for an open quantum system, a
formulation is presented for performing decoherence-free (DF) quantum computing
in Rigged Liouville Space (RLS). Three types of interactions were considered,
and in each case, stationary and evolutionary states were evaluated for DF
behavior in both the total space and the projected subspace. Projected
subspaces were found using the subdynamics kinetic equation. It was shown that
although the total space may be decoherent, the subspace can be DF. In the
projected subspace, the evolution of the density operator may be time
asymmetric. Hence, a formulation for performing quantum computing in RLS or
rigged Hilbert space (RHS) was proposed, and a quantum Controlled-Not Logical
gate with corresponding operations in RLS (RHS) was constructed. A generalized
quantum Turing machine in RHS was also discussed. Key Words: Quantum Computing,
