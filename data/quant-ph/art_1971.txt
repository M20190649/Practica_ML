Statistics of light in Raman and Brillouin nonlinear couplers
Statistical properties of optical fields in nonlinear couplers composed of
two waveguides in which Raman or Brillouin processes (with classical pumping)
are in operation and which are mutually connected through the Stokes and/or
anti-Stokes linear interactions are investigated within the framework of
generalized superposition of coherent fields and quantum noise. Heisenberg
equations describing the couplers are solved both analytically under special
conditions and numerically in general cases. Regimes for nonclassical
properties of optical fields, such as sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics,
negative reduced moments of integrated intensity and squeezing of quadrature
fluctuations are discussed for the cases of single and compound fields. General
results are compared with those from short-length approximation.
