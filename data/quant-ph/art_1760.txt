Guiding Neutral Atoms with a Wire
We demonstrate guiding of cold neutral atoms along a current carrying wire.
Atoms either move in Kepler-like orbits around the wire or are guided in a
potential tube on the side of the wire which is created by applying an
additional homogeneous bias field. These atom guides are very versatile and
promising for applications in atom optics.
