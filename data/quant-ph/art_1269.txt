Homodyne measurement of exponential phase moments for quantum-phase
  reconstruction
We directly sample the exponential moments of the canonical phase for various
quantum states from the homodyne output. The method enables us to study the
phase properties experimentally, without making the detour via reconstructing
the density matrix or the Wigner function and calculating the phase statistics
from them. In particular, combing the measurement with a measurement of the
photon-number variance, we verify fundamental number-phase uncertainty.
