Double jumps and transition rates for two dipole-interacting atoms
Cooperative effects in the fluorescence of two dipole-interacting atoms, with
macroscopic quantum jumps (light and dark periods), are investigated. The
transition rates between different intensity periods are calculated in closed
form and are used to determine the rates of double jumps between periods of
double intensity and dark periods, the mean duration of the three intensity
periods and the mean rate of their occurrence. We predict, to our knowledge for
the first time, cooperative effects for double jumps, for atomic distances from
one and to ten wave lengths of the strong transition. The double jump rate, as
a function of the atomic distance, can show oscillations of up to 30% at
distances of about a wave length, and oscillations are still noticeable at a
distance of ten wave lengths. The cooperative effects of the quantities and
their characteristic behavior turn out to be strongly dependent on the laser
detuning.
