Decoherence, Chaos, and the Correspondence Principle
We present evidence that decoherence can produce a smooth
quantum-to-classical transition in nonlinear dynamical systems. High-resolution
tracking of quantum and classical evolutions reveals differences in expectation
values of corresponding observables. Solutions of master equations demonstrate
that decoherence destroys quantum interference in Wigner distributions and
washes out fine structure in classical distributions bringing the two closer
together. Correspondence between quantum and classical expectation values is
also re-established.
