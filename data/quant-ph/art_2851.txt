Time-dependent Perturbation Theory in Quantum Mechanics
After revealing difficulties of the standard time-dependent perturbation
theory in quantum mechanics mainly from the viewpoint of practical calculation,
we propose a new quasi-canonical perturbation theory. In the new theory, the
dynamics of physical observables, instead of that of coefficients of
wave-function expansion, is formulated so that the gauge-invariance and
correspondence principles are observed naturally.
