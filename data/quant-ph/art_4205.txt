How a Quantum Theory Based on Generalized Coherent States Resolves the
  EPR and Measurement Problems
It is shown that the quantum theory can be formulated on homogeneous spaces
of generalized coherent states in a manner that accounts for interference,
entanglement, and the linearity of dynamics without using the superposition
principle. The coherent state labels, which are essentially instructions for
preparing states, make it unnecessary to identify properties with projectors in
Hilbert space. This eliminates the so called "eigenvalue-eigenstate" link, and
the theory thereby escapes the measurement problem. What the theory allows us
to predict is the distribution in the outcomes of tests of relations between
coherent states. It is shown that quantum non-determinism can be attributed to
a hidden variable (noise) in the space of relations without violating the no-go
theorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker). It is shown that the coherent state vacuum is
distorted when entangled states are generated. The non-locality of the vacuum
permits this distortion to be felt everywhere without the transmission of a
signal and thereby accounts for EPR correlations in a manifestly covariant way.
