Programming Pulse Driven Quantum Computers
Arrays of weakly-coupled quantum systems can be made to compute by subjecting
them to a sequence of electromagnetic pulses of well-defined frequency and
length. Such pulsed arrays are true quantum computers: bits can be placed in
superpositions of 0 and 1, logical operations take place coherently, and
dissipation is required only for error correction. Programming such computers
is accomplished by selecting the proper sequence of pulses.
