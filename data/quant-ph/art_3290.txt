Renormalization Group in Quantum Mechanics
We establish the renormalization group equation for the running action in the
context of a one quantum particle system. This equation is deduced by
integrating each fourier mode after the other in the path integral formalism.
It is free of the well known pathologies which appear in quantum field theory
due to the sharp cutoff. We show that for an arbitrary background path the
usual local form of the action is not preserved by the flow. To cure this
problem we consider a more general action than usual which is stable by the
renormalization group flow. It allows us to obtain a new consistent
renormalization group equation for the action.
