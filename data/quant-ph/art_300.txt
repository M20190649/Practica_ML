On The relation between Superconductivity and Quantum Hall Effect
We introduce a model of superconductivity and discuss its relation to the
quantum Hall-effect. This kind of relation is supported by the well known SQUID
results. The concept of pure gauge potential as it is involved in various
theoretical models concerning solid state effects in magnetic fields is also
discussed.
