Ladder operator formalisms and generally deformed oscillator algebraic
  structures of quantum states in Fock space
We show that various kinds of one-photon quantum states studied in the field
of quantum optics admit ladder operator formalisms and have the generally
deformed oscillator algebraic structure. The two-photon case is also
considered. We obtain the ladder operator formalisms of two general states
defined in the even/odd Fock space. The two-photon states may also have a
generally deformed oscillator algebraic structure. Some interesting examples of
one-photon and two-photon quantum states are given.
