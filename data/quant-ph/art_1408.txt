Reply to the Comment on "Resonant Spectra and the Time Evolution of the
  Survival and Nonescape Probabilities"
In our paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 337 (1995)], we derived an exact
expression for the survival and nonescape probabilities as an expansion in
terms of resonant states. It was shown that these quantities exhibit at long
times a different behavior. Although both decay as a power law, they have
different exponents. In this paper we show that, contrary to the claim in the
Comment of R. M. Cavalcanti (quant-ph/9704023), the nonescape probability decay
for long times as an inverse power law.
