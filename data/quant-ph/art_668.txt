Non--locality of particle spin: a consequence of interaction energy?
Neutron interference measurements with macroscopic beam separation allow to
study the influence of magnetic fields on spin properties. By calculating the
interaction energy with a dynamic and deterministic model, we are able to
establish that the phase shift on one component of the neutron beam is linear
with magnetic intensity, and equally, that interaction energy as well as phase
shifts do not depend on the orientation of the magnetic field. The theoretical
treatment allows the conclusion that the non-local properties of particle spin
derive from the classical equation for interaction energy and the fact, that
interaction energy does not depend on magnetic field orientation. Additionally,
it can be established that the 4 pi symmetry of spinors in this case depends on
the scaling of magnetic fields.
