Time and Events
Time plays a special role in Standard Quantum Theory. The concept of time
observable causes many controversies there. In Event Enhanced Quantum Theory
(in short: EEQT) Schroedinger's differential equation is replaced by a em
piecewise deterministic algorithm} that describes also the timing of events.
This allows us to revisit the problem of time of arrival in quantum theory.
