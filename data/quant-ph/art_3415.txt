The Pauli Equation for Probability Distributions
The "marginal" distributions for measurable coordinate and spin projection is
introduced. Then, the analog of the Pauli equation for spin-1/2 particle is
obtained for such probability distributions instead of the usual wave
functions. That allows a classical-like approach to quantum mechanics. Some
illuminating examples are presented.
