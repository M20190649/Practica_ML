The class of languages recognizable by 1-way quantum finite automata is
  not closed under union
In this paper we develop little further the theory of quantum finite automata
(QFA). There are already few properties of QFA known, that deterministic and
probabilistic finite automata do not have e.g. they cannot recognize all
regular languages. In this paper we show, that class of languages recognizable
by QFA is not closed under union, even not under any Boolean operation, where
both arguments are significant.
