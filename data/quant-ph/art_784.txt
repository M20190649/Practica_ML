Quantum codes of minimum distance two
It is reasonable to expect the theory of quantum codes to be simplified in
the case of codes of minimum distance 2; thus, it makes sense to examine such
codes in the hopes that techniques that prove effective there will generalize.
With this in mind, we present a number of results on codes of minimum distance
2. We first compute the linear programming bound on the dimension of such a
code, then show that this bound can only be attained when the code either is of
even length, or is of length 3 or 5. We next consider questions of uniqueness,
showing that the optimal code of length 2 or 4 is unique (implying that the
well-known one-qubit-in-five single-error correcting code is unique), and
presenting nonadditive optimal codes of all greater even lengths. Finally, we
compute the full automorphism group of the more important distance 2 codes,
allowing us to determine the full automorphism group of any GF(4)-linear code.
