Universal Quantum Computation with the Exchange Interaction
Experimental implementations of quantum computer architectures are now being
investigated in many different physical settings. The full set of requirements
that must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is
daunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In
this report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that
can be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2],
and using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these
approaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable
Heisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\vec S}_i\cdot{\vec
S}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control
of a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit
operations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials
and device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence
rate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction
alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of
a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional
two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the
complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these
solid-state implementations of quantum computation.
