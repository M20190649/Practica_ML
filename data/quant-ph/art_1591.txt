Retroactive quantum jumps in a strongly-coupled atom-field system
We investigate a novel type of conditional dynamic that occurs in the
strongly-driven Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation. Extending the work of
Alsing and Carmichael [Quantum Opt. {\bf 3}, 13 (1991)], we present a combined
numerical and analytic study of the Stochastic Master Equation that describes
the system's conditional evolution when the cavity output is continuously
observed via homodyne detection, but atomic spontaneous emission is not
monitored at all. We find that quantum jumps of the atomic state are induced by
its dynamical coupling to the optical field, in order retroactively to justify
atypical fluctuations in ocurring in the homodyne photocurrent.
