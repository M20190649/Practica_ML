The Geometric Phase and Ray Space Isometries
We study the behaviour of the geometric phase under isometries of the ray
space. This leads to a better understanding of a theorem first proved by
Wigner: isometries of the ray space can always be realised as projections of
unitary or anti-unitary transformations on the Hilbert space. We suggest that
the construction involved in Wigner's proof is best viewed as an use of the
Pancharatnam connection to ``lift'' a ray space isometry to the Hilbert space.
