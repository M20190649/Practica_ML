CNOT operator and its similar matrices in quantum computation
We present a theoretical result, which is based on the linear algebra theory
(similar operators). The obtained theoretical results optimize the experimental
technique to construct quantum computer e.g., reduces the number of steps to
perform the logical CNOT (XOR) operation. The present theoretical technique can
also be generalized to the other operators in in quantum computation and
information theory.
