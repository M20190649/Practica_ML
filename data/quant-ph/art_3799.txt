Particle on a polygon: Quantum Mechanics
We study the quantization of a model proposed by Newton to explain
centripetal force namely, that of a particle moving on a regular polygon. The
exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained. The quantum mechanics of a
particle moving on a circle and in an infinite potential well are derived as
limiting cases.
