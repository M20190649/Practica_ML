Reconstructing the density operator via simple projectors
We describe the representation of arbitrary density operators in terms of
expectation values of simple projection operators. Two representations are
presented which yield non--recursive schemes for experimentally determining the
density operator of any quantum system. We suggest a possible experimental
implementation in quantum optics.
