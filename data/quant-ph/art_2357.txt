Science and Paranormal Phenomena
In order to ground my approach to the study of paranormal phenomena, I first
explain my operational approach to physics, and to the ``historical'' sciences
of cosmic, biological, human, social and political evolution. I then indicate
why I believe that ``paranormal phenomena'' might --- but need not --- fit into
this framework. I endorse the need for a new theoretical framework for the
investigation of this field presented by Etter and Shoup at this meeting. I
close with a short discussion of Ted Bastin's contention that paranormal
phenomena should be {\it defined} as contradicting physics.
