Quantum non ideal measurements
We analyse non ideal quantum measurements described as scattering processes
providing an estimator of the measured quantity. The sensitivity is expressed
as an equivalent input noise. We address the Von Neumann problem of chained
measurements and show the crucial role of preamplification.
