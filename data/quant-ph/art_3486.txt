A Refutation of Bell's Theorem
Bell's Theorem was developed on the basis of considerations involving a
linear combination of spin correlation functions, each of which has a distinct
pair of arguments. The simultaneous presence of these different pairs of
arguments in the same equation can be understood in two radically different
ways: either as `strongly objective,' that is, all correlation functions
pertain to the same set of particle pairs, or as `weakly objective,' that is,
each correlation function pertains to a different set of particle pairs.
  It is demonstrated that once this meaning is determined, no discrepancy
appears between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics: the discrepancy
in Bell's Theorem is due only to a meaningless comparison between a local
realistic inequality written within the strongly objective interpretation (thus
relevant to a single set of particle pairs) and a quantum mechanical prediction
derived from a weakly objective interpretation (thus relevant to several
different sets of particle pairs).
