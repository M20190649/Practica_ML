Reversible quantum teleportation in an optical lattice
We propose a protocol, based on entanglement procedures recently suggested by
[D. Jaksch et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1975 (1999)], which allows the
teleportation of an unknown state of a neutral atom in an optical lattice to
another atom in another site of the lattice, without any irreversible
detection.
