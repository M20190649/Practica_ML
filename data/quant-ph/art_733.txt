Measurement in Quantum Physics
The conceptual problems in quantum mechanics -- related to the collapse of
the wave function, the particle-wave duality, the meaning of measurement --
arise from the need to ascribe particle character to the wave function. As will
be shown, all these problems dissolve when working instead with quantum fields,
which have both wave and particle character. Otherwise the predictions of
quantum physics, including Bell's inequalities, coincide with those of the
standard treatments. The transfer of the results of the quantum measurement to
the classical realm is also discussed.
