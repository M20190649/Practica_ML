Measurement-induced quantum diffusion
The dynamics of a kicked quantum system undergoing repeated measurements of
momentum is investigated. A diffusive behavior is obtained even when the
dynamics of the classical counterpart is not chaotic. The diffusion coefficient
is explicitly computed for a large class of Hamiltonians and compared to the
classical case.
