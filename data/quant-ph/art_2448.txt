Loss and heating of particles in small and noisy traps
We derive the life time and loss rate for a trapped particle that is coupled
to fluctuating fields in the vicinity of a room-temperature metallic and/or
dielectric surface. Our results indicate a clear predominance of near field
effects over ordinary blackbody radiation. We develop a theoretical framework
for both charged and neutral particles with and without spin. Loss processes
that are due to a transition to an untrapped internal state are included.
