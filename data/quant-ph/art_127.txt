Logic programming as quantum measurement
The emphasis is made on the juxtaposition of (quantum~theorem) proving versus
quantum (theorem~proving). The logical contents of verification of the
statements concerning quantum systems is outlined. The Zittereingang (trembling
input) principle is introduced to enhance the resolution of predicate
satisfiability problem provided the processor is in a position to perform
operations with continuous input. A realization of Zittereingang machine by a
quantum system is suggested.
