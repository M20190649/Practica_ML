Generalization of Grover's Algorithm to Multiobject Search in Quantum
  Computing, Part I: Continuous Time and Discrete Time
L. K. Grover's search algorithm in quantum computing gives an optimal,
quadratic speedup in the search for a single object in a large unsorted
database. In this paper, we generalize Grover's algorithm in a Hilbert-space
framework for both continuous and discrete time cases that isolates its
geometrical essence to the case where more than one object satisfies the search
criterion.
