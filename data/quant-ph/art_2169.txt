The ultimate quantum limit to the linewidth of lasers
The standard quantum limit to the linewidth of a laser for which the gain
medium can be adiabatically eliminated is $\ell_{0}=\kappa/2\bar{n}$. Here
$\kappa$ is the intensity damping rate and $\bar{n}$ the mean photon number.
This contains equal contributions from the loss and gain processes, so that
simple arguments which attribute the linewidth wholly to phase noise from
spontaneous gain are wrong. I show that an {\em unstimulated} gain process
actually introduces no phase noise, so that the ultimate quantum limit to the
laser linewidth comes from the loss alone and is equal to $\ell_{ult}=
\kappa/4\bar{n}$. I investigate a number of physical gain mechanisms which
attempt to achieve gain without phase noise: a linear atom-field coupling with
finite interaction time; a nonlinear atom-field coupling; and adiabatic photon
transfer using a counterintuitive pulse sequence. The first at best reaches the
standard limit $\ell_{0}$, the second reaches $3/4 \ell_{0}$, while the third
reaches the ultimate limit of $\ell_{ult} = 1/2 \ell_{0}$.
