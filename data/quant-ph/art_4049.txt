Solvable analogue of the imaginary cubic oscillator
We prove that the purely imaginary square well generates an infinite number
of bound states with real energies. In the strong-coupling limit, our exact PT
symmetric solutions coincide, utterly unexpectedly, with their textbook, well
known Hermitian predecessors.
