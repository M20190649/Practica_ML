Off-shell indefinite-metric triple-bracket generalization of the Dirac
  equation
We present an off-shell indefinite-metric reformulation of the earlier
on-shell positive-metric triple bracket generalization of the Dirac equation.
The new version of the formalism solves the question of its manifest
covariance.
