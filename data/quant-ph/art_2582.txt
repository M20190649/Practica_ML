On the Way to Submicroscopic Description of Nature
The outline analyzes the principal difficulties, which emerge at the applying
of modern quantum theory based on the Copenhagen School concept to phenomena
developed in the range close to 10^{-28} cm (the point of intersection of the
three fundamental interactions). It is shown that at this scale, the
interaction of a moving particle with space plays an essential role and just
space assigns wave and quantum properties to the particle. The main physical
aspects of space structure are discussed herein.
