Comment on "Giant absorption cross section of ultracold neutrons in
  Gadolinium"
Rauch et al (PRL 83, 4955, 1999) have compared their measurements of the Gd
cross section for Ultra-cold neutrons with an exptrapolation of the cross
section for thermal neutrons and interpreted the discrepancy in terms of
coherence properties of the neutron. We show the extrapolation used is based on
a misunderstanding and that coherence properties play no role in absorption.
