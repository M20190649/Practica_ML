The N-box paradox in orthodox quantum mechanics
The prediction of the N-box paradox, that whichever box is opened will
contain the record of the particle having passed through it, is traced to a
failure to specify whether the other boxes are distinguishable or
indistinguishable. These correspond to different ways of lifting the degeneracy
of a certain measurement, and have incompatible consequences.
