Heisenberg picture operators in the quantum state diffusion model
A stochastic simulation algorithm for the computation of multitime
correlation functions which is based on the quantum state diffusion model of
open systems is developed. The crucial point of the proposed scheme is a
suitable extension of the quantum master equation to a doubled Hilbert space
which is then unraveled by a stochastic differential equation.
