Finding a state in a haystack
We consider the problem to single out a particular state among $2^n$
orthogonal pure states. As it turns out, in general the optimal strategy is not
to measure the particles separately, but to consider joint properties of the
$n$-particle system. The required number of propositions is $n$. There exist
$2^n!$ equivalent operational procedures to do so. We enumerate some
configurations for three particles, in particular the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)- and W-states, which are specific cases of a
unitary transformation For the GHZ-case, an explicit physical meaning of the
projection operators is discussed.
