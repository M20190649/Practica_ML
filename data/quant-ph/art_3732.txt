Product Bases in Quantum Information Theory
We review the role of product bases in quantum information theory. We prove
two conjectures which were made in DiVincenzo et al., quant-ph/9908070, namely
the existence of two sets of bipartite unextendible product bases, in arbitrary
dimensions, which are based on a tile construction. We pose some questions
related to complete product bases.
