On the factorization method in quantum mechanics
New exactly solvable problems have already been studied by using a
modification of the factorization method introduced by Mielnik. We review this
method and its connection with the traditional factorization method. The survey
includes the discussion on a generalization of the factorization energies used
in the traditional Infeld and Hull method.
