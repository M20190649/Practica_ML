Which causality? Differences between the trajectory and Copenhagen
  analyses of an impulsive perturbation
The trajectory and Copenhagen representations render different predictions
for impulse perturbations. The different predictions are due to the different
roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations. We
investigate a small perturbing impulse acting on the ground state of an
infinitely deep square well. For the two representations, the first-order
perturbation calculations for the temporal change in energy differ. This
temporal change in energy for the trajectory representation is dependent upon
the microstate of the wave function. We show that even under Copenhagen
epistemology, the two representations predict different theoretical results.
