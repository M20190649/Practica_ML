IS THERE A CLASSICAL ANALOG OF A QUANTUM TIME-TRANSLATION MACHINE?
In a recent article [D. Suter, Phys. Rev. {\bf A 51}, 45 (1995)] Suter has
claimed to present an optical implementation of the quantum time-translation
machine which ``shows all the features that the general concept predicts and
also allows, besides the quantum mechanical, a classical description.'' It is
argued that the experiment proposed and performed by Suter does not have the
features of the quantum time-translation machine and that the latter has no
classical analog.
