Tales and Tails and Stuff and Nonsense
In an informal way I review collapse models and my part in constructing them,
and I recall some encounters with Abner Shimony. In particular, I address the
question of the nature of spacetime reality in collapse models, stimulated by
Abner's criticism of the "tail" possessed by statevectors in such models.
