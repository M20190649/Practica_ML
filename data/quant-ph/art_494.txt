Operator Transformations Between Exactly Solvable Potentials and Their
  Lie Group Generators
One may obtain, using operator transformations, algebraic relations between
the Fourier transforms of the causal propagators of different exactly solvable
potentials. These relations are derived for the shape invariant potentials.
Also, potentials related by real transformation functions are shown to have the
same spectrum generating algebra with Hermitian generators related by this
operator transformation.
