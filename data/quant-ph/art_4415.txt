The Pegg-Barnett Formalism and Covariant Phase Observables
We compare the Pegg-Barnett (PB) formalism with the covariant phase
observable approach to the problem of quantum phase and show that PB-formalism
gives essentially the same results as the canonical (covariant) phase
observable. We also show that PB-formalism can be extended to cover all
covariant phase observables including the covariant phase observable arising
from the angle margin of the Husimi Q-function.
