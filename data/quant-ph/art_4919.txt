Aspects of a Two-Level Atom in Squeezed Displaced Fock States
This paper presents some results on some aspects of the two-level atom
interacting with a single-mode with the privileged field mode being in the
squeezed displaced Fock state (SDFS). The exact results are employed to perform
a careful investigation of the temporal evolution of the atomic inversion,
entropy and phase distribution. It is shown that the interference between
component states leads to non-classical oscillations in the photon number
distribution. At mid revival time the field is almost in the pure state.
  We have briefly discussed the evolution of the Q function of the cavity
field. The connection between the field entropy and the collapses and revivals
of the atomic inversion has been established. We find that the phase
probability distribution of the field reflect the collapses and revivals of the
level occupation probabilities in most situations. The interaction brings about
the symmetrical splitting of the phase probability distribution. The general
conclusions reached are illustrated by numerical results.
