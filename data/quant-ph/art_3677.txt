Exactly solvable models of quantum mechanics including fluctuations in
  the framework of representation of the wave function by random process
The problem of quantum harmonic oscillator with "regular+random" square
frequency, subjected to "regular+random external force, is considered in
framework of representation of the wave function by complex-valued random
process. Average transition probabilities are calculated. Stochastic density
matrix method is developed, which is used for investigation of thermodinamical
characteristics of the system, such as entropy and average energy.
