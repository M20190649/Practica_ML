Different realizations of tomographic principle in quantum state
  measurement
We establish a general principle for the tomographic approach to quantum
state reconstruction, till now based on a simple rotation transformation in the
phase space, which allows us to consider other types of transformations. Then,
we will present different realizations of the principle in specific examples.
