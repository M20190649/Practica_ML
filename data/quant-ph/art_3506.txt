Quantum key distribution using different-frequency photons
In this paper, we present a scheme for quantum key distribution, in which
different-frequency photons are used to encode the key. Thses
different-frequency photons are produced by an acoustic-optical modulator and
two kinds of narrow filters . This scheme may be implementable in practice.
