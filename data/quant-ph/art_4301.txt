The Description of Joint Quantum Entities and the Formulation of a
  Paradox
We formulate a paradox in relation to the description of a joint entity
consisting of two subentities by standard quantum mechanics. We put forward a
proposal for a possible solution, entailing the interpretation of density
states as pure states. We explain where the inspiration for this proposal comes
from and how its validity can be tested experimentally. We discuss the
consequences on quantum axiomatics of the proposal.
