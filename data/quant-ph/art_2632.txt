Non-local Correlations are Generic in Infinite-Dimensional Bipartite
  Systems
It was recently shown that the nonseparable density operators for a bipartite
system are trace norm dense if either factor space has infinite dimension. We
show here that non-local states -- i.e., states whose correlations cannot be
reproduced by any local hidden variable model -- are also dense. Our
constructions distinguish between the cases where both factor spaces are
infinite-dimensional, where we show that states violating the CHSH inequality
are dense, and the case where only one factor space is infinite-dimensional,
where we identify open neighborhoods of nonseparable states that do not violate
the CHSH inequality but show that states with a subtler form of non-locality
(often called "hidden" non-locality) remain dense.
