On the Dynamical Invariants and the Geometric Phases for a General Spin
  System in a Changing Magnetic Field
We consider a class of general spin Hamiltonians of the form
$H_s(t)=H_0(t)+H'(t)$ where $H_0(t)$ and $H'(t)$ describe the dipole
interaction of the spins with an arbitrary time-dependent magnetic field and
the internal interaction of the spins, respectively. We show that if $H'(t)$ is
rotationally invariant, then $H_s(t)$ admits the same dynamical invariant as
$H_0(t)$. A direct application of this observation is a straightforward
rederivation of the results of Yan et al [Phys. Lett. A, Vol: 251 (1999) 289
and Vol: 259 (1999) 207] on the Heisenberg spin system in a changing magnetic
field.
