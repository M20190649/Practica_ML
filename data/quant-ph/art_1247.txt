Mixed-state entanglement and distillation: is there a ``bound''
  entanglement in nature?
It is shown that if a mixed state can be distilled to the singlet form, it
must violate partial transposition criterion [A. Peres, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76,
1413 (1996)]. It implies that there are two qualitatively different types of
entanglement: ``free'' entanglement which is distillable, and ``bound''
entanglement which cannot be brought to the singlet form useful for quantum
communication purposes. Possible physical meaning of the result is discussed.
