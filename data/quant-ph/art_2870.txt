Radiation of a quantum localized source
New effective operators, describing the photons with given polarization at
given position with respect to a source are proposed. These operators can be
used to construct the near and intermediate zones quantum optics. It is shown
that the use of the conventional plane photons can lead to a wrong results for
quantum fluctuations of polarization even in the far zone.
