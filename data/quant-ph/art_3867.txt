Charge based quantum computer without charge transfer
A novel implementation of a charge based quantum computer is proposed. There
is no charge transfer during calculation, therefore, uncontrollable
entanglement between qubits due to long-range Coulomb forces is suppressed.
High-speed computation with 1ps per an operation looks as feasible.
