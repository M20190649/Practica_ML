Experimental Tests for Stochastic Reduction Models
Stochastic models for quantum state reduction give rise to statistical laws
that are in many respects in agreement with those of standard quantum
measurement theory. Here we construct a counterexample involving a Hamiltonian
with degenerate eigenvalues such that the statistical predictions of stochastic
reduction models differ from the predictions of quantum measurement theory. An
idealised experiment is proposed whereby the validity of these predictions can
be put to the test.
