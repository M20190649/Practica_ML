Exact semiclassical wave equation for stochastic quantum optics
Semiclassical (stochastic) wave equations are proposed for the coupled
dynamics of atomic quantum states and semiclassical radiation field. All
relevant predictions of standard unitary quantum dynamics are exactly
reproducible in the framework of stochastic wave equation model. We stress in
such a way that the concept of stochastic wave equations is not to be
restricted to the widely used Markovian approximation.
