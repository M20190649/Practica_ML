Multi-directional higher-order amplitude squeezing
Fan-even K-quantum nonlinear coherent states are introduced and higher-order
amplitude squeezing is investigated in such states. It is shown that for a
given K the lowest order in which an amplitude component can be squeezed is 2K
and the squeezing appears simultaneously in K directions separated successively
in phase by \pi/K.
