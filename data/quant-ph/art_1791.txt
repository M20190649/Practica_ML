Superluminal Signals: Causal Loop Paradoxes Revisited
Recent results demonstrating superluminal group velocities and tachyonic
dispersion relations reopen the question of superluminal signals and causal
loop paradoxes. The sense in which superluminal signals are permitted is
explained in terms of pulse reshaping, and the self-consistent behavior which
prevents causal loop paradoxes is illustrated by an explicit example.
