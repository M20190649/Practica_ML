Connections Between Special Relativity, Charge Conservation, and Quantum
  Mechanics
Examination of the Einstein energy-momentum relationship suggests that simple
unbound forms of matter exist in a four-dimensional Euclidean space. Position,
momentum, velocity, and other vector quantities can be expressed as Euclidean
four-vectors, with the magnitude of the velocity vector having a constant
value, the speed of light. We see that charge may be simply a manifestation of
momentum in the new fourth direction, which implies that charge conservation is
a form of momentum conservation. The constancy of speed implies that all
elementary free particles can be described in the same manner as photons, by
means of a wave equation. The resulting wave mechanics (with a few small
assumptions) is simply the traditional form of quantum mechanics. If one begins
by assuming the wave nature of matter, it is shown that special relativistic
results follow simply. Thus we see evidence of a strong connection between
relativity and quantum mechanics. Comparisons between the theory presented here
and Kaluza-Klein theories reveal some similarities, but also many significant
differences between them.
