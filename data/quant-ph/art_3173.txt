Finite temperature excitations of an inhomogneous trapped Bose gas with
  Feshbach resonances
We derive and discuss the temperature dependance of the condensate and
noncondensate density profile of a Bose-Einstein condensate gas with Feshbach
resonance in a parabolic trap. These quantities are calculated
self-consistently using the generalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations
within the Bogoliubov approximation. At zero temperature, the HFB equation can
be solved by means of a variation method that give the low excitation spectrum.
Moreover, within the two-body collision theory, we estimate the relationship
between the atom number and the external magnetic field $B$, it is in good
agreement with the data in recent experiments.
