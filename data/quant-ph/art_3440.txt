Estimating mixed quantum states
We discuss single adaptive measurements for the estimation of mixed quantum
states of qubits. The results are compared to the optimal estimation schemes
using collective measurements. We also demonstrate that the advantage of
collective measurements increases when the degree of mixing of the quantum
states increases.
