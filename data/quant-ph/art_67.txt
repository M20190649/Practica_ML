Quantum Mechanics as a Classical Theory II: Relativistic Theory
In this article, the axioms presented in the first one are reformulated
according to the special theory of relativity. Using these axioms, quantum
mechanic's relativistic equations are obtained in the presence of
electromagnetic fields for both the density function and the probability
amplitude. It is shown that, within the present theory's scope, Dirac's second
order equation should be considered the fundamental one in spite of the first
order equation. A relativistic expression is obtained for the statistical
potential. Axioms are again altered and made compatible with the general theory
of relativity. These postulates, together with the idea of the statistical
potential, allow us to obtain a general relativistic quantum theory for {\it
ensembles} composed of single particle systems.
