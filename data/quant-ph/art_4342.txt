Quantum control using sequences of simple control pulses
Structured decompositions of a desired unitary operator are employed to
derive control schemes that achieve certain control objectives for finite-level
quantum systems using only sequences of simple control pulses such as square
waves with finite rise and decay times or Gaussian wavepackets. The technique
is applied to find control schemes that achieve population transfers for
pure-state systems, complete inversions of the ensemble populations for
mixed-state systems, create arbitrary superposition states and optimize the
ensemble average of observables.
