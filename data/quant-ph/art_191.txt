EPR-Bell Nonlocality, Lorentz Invariance, and Bohmian Quantum Theory
We discuss the problem of finding a Lorentz invariant extension of Bohmian
mechanics. Due to the nonlocality of the theory there is (for systems of more
than one particle) no obvious way to achieve such an extension. We present a
model invariant under a certain limit of Lorentz transformations, a limit
retaining the characteristic feature of relativity, the non-existence of
absolute time resp. simultaneity. The analysis of this model exemplifies an
important property of any Bohmian quantum theory: the quantum equilibrium
distribution $\rho = |\psi |^2$ cannot simultaneously be realized in all
Lorentz frames of reference.
