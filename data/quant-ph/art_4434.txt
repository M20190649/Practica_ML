Consciousness and Endogenous State Reduction: Two Experiments
It is normally claimed that physical systems create and influence
consciousness, but that consciousness cannot influence physical systems.
However, I believe that this idea is flawed, and I suggest the following
experiments as a way of demonstrating the influence of consciousness on
physical systems. The first uses Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with
humans, and the second uses autoradiography with rats. Background arguments are
given, where it is claimed that 'pain' consciousness is correlated in a certain
way with the binding of opiates to receptors in the brain. Key Words: state
reduction, state collapse, macroscopic superpositions, PET scan,
autoradiography.
