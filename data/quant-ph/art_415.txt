Motion Induced Radiation from a Vibrating Cavity
We study the radiation emitted by a cavity moving in vacuum. We give a
quantitative estimate of the photon production inside the cavity as well as of
the photon flux radiated from the cavity. A resonance enhancement occurs not
only when the cavity length is modulated but also for a global oscillation of
the cavity. For a high finesse cavity the emitted radiation surpasses radiation
from a single mirror by orders of magnitude.
