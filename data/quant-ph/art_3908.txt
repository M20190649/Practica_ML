Finding Solutions to NP Problems: Philosophical Difference Between
  Quantum and Evolutionary Search Algorithms
There is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can solve an NP problem.
Evolutionary search has been shown to be a viable method of finding acceptable
solutions within a reasonable time period. Recently quantum computers have
surfaced as another alternative method. But these two methods use radically
different philosophies for solving NP problems even though both search methods
are non-deterministic. This paper uses instances of {\bf SAT}, {\bf 3SAT} and
{\bf TSP} to describe how these two methods differ in their approach to solving
NP problems.
