The Global Nature of the Arrow of Time and the Bohm-Reichenbach diagram
The importance of the global nature of the arrow of time is shown. Classical
Reichenbach diagram and quantum Bohm-Reichenbach diagram, for the universe are
introduced. They are used to show the increase of entropy in closed systems,
the global nature of the quantum measurement, and the relation among the
different arrows of time.
