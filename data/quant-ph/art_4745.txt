Quantum techniques using continuous variables of light
We present schemes for the generation and evaluation of continuous variable
entanglement of bright optical beams and give a brief overview of the variety
of optical techniques and quantum communication applications on this basis. A
new entanglement-based quantum interferometry scheme with bright beams is
suggested. The performance of the presented schemes is independent of the
relative interference phase which is advantageous for quantum communication
applications.
