Nonadditivity of Bipartite Distillable Entanglement follows from
  Conjecture on Bound Entangled Werner States
Assuming the validity of a conjecture in quant-ph/9910026 and
quant-ph/9910022 we show that the distillable entanglement for two bipartite
states, each of which individually has zero distillable entanglement, can be
nonzero. We show that this also implies that the distillable entanglement is
not a convex function. Our example consists of the tensor product of a bound
entangled state based on an unextendible product basis with a Werner state
which lies in the class of conjectured undistillable states.
