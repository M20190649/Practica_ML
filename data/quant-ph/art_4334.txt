Spin squeezing of atoms by Rydberg blockade
We show that the interaction between Rydberg atomic states can provide
continuous spin squeezing of atoms with two ground states. The interaction
prevents the simultaneous excitation of more than a single atom in the sample
to the Rydberg state, and we propose to utilize this blockade effect to realize
an effective collective spin hamiltonian J_x^2-J_y^2. With this hamiltonian the
quantum mechanical uncertainty of the spin variable J_x+J_y can be reduced
significantly.
