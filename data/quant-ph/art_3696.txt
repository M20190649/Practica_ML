The Classical Limit of Quantum Mechanics and the Fejer Sum of the
  Fourier Series Expansion of a Classical Quantity
In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of a quantity on a quantum state,
provided that the state itself gives in the classical limit a motion of a
particle in a definite path, in classical limit goes over to Fourier series
form of the classical quantity. In contrast to this widely accepted point of
view, a rigorous calculation shows that the expectation value on such a state
in classical limit exactly gives the Fej\'{e}r's arithmetic mean of the partial
sums of the Fourier series.
