QED derived from the two-body interaction (1) Mapping to M-space
We have shown in a previous paper that the Dirac bispinor can vary like a
four-vector and that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) can be reproduced with this
form of behaviour.(1) Here, in part I of this paper, we show that QED with the
same transformational behaviour also holds in an alternative space we call
M-space. We use the four-vector behaviour to model the two-body interaction in
M and show that this has similar physical properties to the usual model which
it predicts. In part (2) of this paper(4) we use M-space to show that QED can
be reduced to two simple rules for a two-body interaction.
