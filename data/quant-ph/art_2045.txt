A role of antiquantum bits for superdense coding and quantum computing
We define an anti-quantum bit state via analogous way as the anti-state in
Particle Physics.We show the quantum information Feymann diagrams for the
teleportations and superdense coding, which preserve the information flow. The
role of information vacuum and anihilation between error information and
anti-information is mentioned for the stability of quantum computing.
