Bounds on relative entropy of entanglement for multi-party systems
We present upper and lower bounds to the relative entropy of entanglement of
multi-party systems in terms of the bi-partite entanglements of formation and
distillation and entropies of various subsystems. We point out implications of
our results to the local reversible convertibility of multi-party pure states
and discuss their physical basis in terms of deleting of information.
