Information-theoretic aspects of quantum inseparability of mixed states
Information-theoretic aspects of quantum inseparability of mixed states are
investigated in terms of the $\alpha$-entropy inequalities and teleportation
fidelity. Inseparability of mixed states is defined and a complete
characterization of the inseparable $2\times2$ systems with maximally
disordered subsystems is presented within the Hilbert-Schmidt space formalism.
A connection between teleportation and negative conditional $\alpha$-entropy is
also emphasized.
