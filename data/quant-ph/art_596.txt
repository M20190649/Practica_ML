Relativistic Operator Description of Photon Polarization
We present an operator approach to the description of photon polarization,
based on Wigner's concept of elementary relativistic systems. The theory of
unitary representations of the Poincare group, and of parity, are exploited to
construct spinlike operators acting on the polarization states of a photon at
each fixed energy momentum. The nontrivial topological features of these
representations relevant for massless particles, and the departures from the
treatment of massive finite spin representations, are highlighted and
addressed.
