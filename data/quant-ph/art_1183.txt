Cryptography, Quantum Computation and Trapped Ions
The significance of quantum computation for cryptography is discussed.
Following a brief survey of the requirements for quantum computational
hardware, an overview of the ion trap quantum computation project at Los Alamos
is presented. The physical limitations to quantum computation with trapped ions
are analyzed and an assessment of the computational potential of the technology
is made.
