Real-time tunneling
Starting with the equivalence of the rest energy of a particle to an amount
of the radiant energy characterized by a frequency, in addition to the usual
relativistic transformation rules leading to the wave-particle duality, we
investigate the case in which this frequency is an internal propery of the
particle. This kind of interpretation of the frequency is shown to be relevant
to the tunneling effect. The investigations in this direction yield (1) a
purely real time everywhere, (2) an anti-hermitian momentum operator, (3) a
corpuscular structure for the particle, and (4) all of the known theoretical
predictions about the tunneling effect.
