Local modification of the Abrams-Lloyd nonlinear algorithm
The nonlinear algorithms proposed recently by Abrams and Lloyd [Report No.
quant-ph/9801041] are fast but make an explicit use of an arbitrarily fast
unphysical transfer of information within a quantum computer. It is shown that
there exists a simplification of the second Abrams-Lloyd algorithm which
eliminates the unphysical effect but keeps the algorithm fast.
