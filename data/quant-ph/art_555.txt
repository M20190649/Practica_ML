Active stabilisation, quantum computation and quantum state synthesis
Active stabilisation of a quantum system is the active suppression of noise
(such as decoherence) in the system, without disrupting its unitary evolution.
Quantum error correction suggests the possibility of achieving this, but only
if the recovery network can suppress more noise than it introduces. A general
method of constructing such networks is proposed, which gives a substantial
improvement over previous fault tolerant designs. The construction permits
quantum error correction to be understood as essentially quantum state
synthesis. An approximate analysis implies that algorithms involving very many
computational steps on a quantum computer can thus be made possible.
