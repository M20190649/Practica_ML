Efficient Refocussing of One Spin and Two Spin Interactions for NMR
  Quantum Computation
The use of spin echoes to refocus one spin interactions (chemical shifts) and
two spin interactions (spin-spin couplings) plays a central role in both
conventional NMR experiments and NMR quantum computation. Here we describe
schemes for efficient refocussing of such interactions in both fully and
partially coupled spin systems.
