Van Hove's "Î»^2 t" limit in nonrelativistic and relativistic
  field-theoretical models
Van Hove's "\lambda^2 t" limiting procedure is analyzed in some interesting
quantum field theoretical cases, both in nonrelativistic and relativistic
models. We look at the deviations from a purely exponential behavior in a decay
process and discuss the subtle issues of state preparation and initial time.
