Teleportation cost and hybrid compression of quantum signals
The amount of entanglement necessary to teleport quantum states drawn from
general ensemble $\{p_i,\rho_i\}$ is derived. The case of perfect transmission
of individual states and that of asymptotically faithful transmission are
discussed. Using the latter result, we also derive the optimum compression rate
when the ensemble is compressed into qubits and bits.
