Searching an Ordered List on a Quantum Computer
Withdrawn by the author due to irreparable errors.
  We present a quantum algorithm that in the black-box model performs a search
in an ordered list of N elements. Using 3/4 log N + O(1) queries, it achieves a
success probability of at least 1/2, whereas classically, log N - O(1) queries
are needed to obtain constant success probability. Moreover, our algorithm
employs the Haar transform and thus differs substantially from Grover's search
algorithm and from algorithms relying on the quantum Fourier transform.
