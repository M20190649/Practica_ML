Reconsidering Bohr's reply to EPR
Although Bohr's reply to the EPR argument is supposed to be a watershed
moment in the development of his philosophy of quantum theory, it is difficult
to find a clear statement of the reply's philosophical point. Moreover, some
have claimed that the point is simply that Bohr is a radical positivist. In
this paper, we show that such claims are unfounded. In particular, we give a
mathematically rigorous reconstruction of Bohr's reply to the \emph{original}
EPR argument that clarifies its logical structure, and which shows that it does
not rest on questionable philosophical assumptions. Rather, Bohr's reply is
dictated by his commitment to provide "classical" and "objective" descriptions
of experimental phenomena.
