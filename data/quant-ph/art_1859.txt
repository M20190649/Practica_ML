Maximally Causal Quantum Mechanics
We present a new causal quantum mechanics in one and two dimensions developed
recently at TIFR by this author and V. Singh. In this theory both position and
momentum for a system point have Hamiltonian evolution in such a way that the
ensemble of system points leads to position and momentum probability densities
agreeing exactly with ordinary quantum mechanics.
