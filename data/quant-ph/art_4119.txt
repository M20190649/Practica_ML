Universal Elementary Constituents of Potential Transformations Shifting
  Waves (Qualitative Theory)
It is shown that the potential perturbation that shifts a chosen standing
wave in space is a block of potential barrier and well for every wave bump
between neighbouring knots. The algorithms shifting the range of the primary
localization of a chosen bound state in a potential well of finite width are as
well applicable to the scattering functions if states of the continuous
spectrum are considered as bound states normalized to unity but distributed on
an infinite interval with vanishing density. The potential perturbations of the
same type on the half-axis concentrate the scattering wave at the origin, thus
creating a bound state embedded into the continuous spectrum (zero width
resonance). It is an improved version of paper: Annalen der Physik, 6 (1997)
