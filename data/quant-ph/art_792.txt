Interaction-Free Measurements, Atom Localisation and Complementarity
We analyse interaction-free measurements on classical and quantum objects. We
show the transition from a classical interaction free measurement to a quantum
non-demolition measurement of atom number, and discuss the mechanism of the
enforcement of complementarity in atom interferometric interaction-free
measurements.
