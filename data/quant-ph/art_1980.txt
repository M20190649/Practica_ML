Lamb shift calculated by simple noncovariant method
The Lamb Shift (LS) of Hydrogenlike atom is evaluated by a simple method of
quantum electrodynamics in noncovariant form, based on the relativistic
stationary Schr\"odinger equation. An induced term proportional to
$\overrightarrow{p}^4$ in the effective Hamiltonian is emphasized. Perturbative
calculation of second order leads to the LS of $ 1S_{1/2}$ state and that of
$2S_{1/2}-2P_{1/2}$ states in H atom with the high accuracy within 0.1%
