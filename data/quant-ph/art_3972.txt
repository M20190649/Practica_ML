The Quantum-Classical Transition in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Viewed as approximations to quantum mechanics, classical evolutions can
violate the positive-semidefiniteness of the density matrix. The nature of this
violation suggests a classification of dynamical systems based on
classical-quantum correspondence; we show that this can be used to identify
when environmental interaction (decoherence) will be unsuccessful in inducing
the quantum-classical transition. In particular, the late-time Wigner function
can become positive without any corresponding approach to classical dynamics.
In the light of these results, we emphasize key issues relevant for experiments
studying the quantum-classical transition.
