WKB and MAF Quantization Rules for Spatially Confined Quantum Mechanical
  Systems
A formalism is developed to obtain the energy eigenvalues of spatially
confined quantum mechanical systems in the framework of The usual WKB and MAF
methods. The technique is applied to three different cases,viz one dimensional
Harmonic Oscillators,Quartic Oscillators and a boxed-in charged particle in
electric field.
