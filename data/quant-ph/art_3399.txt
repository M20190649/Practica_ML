Berry phase for a potential well transported in a homogeneous magnetic
  field
We consider a two-dimensional particle of charge $e$ interacting with a
homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and a potential well
which is transported along a closed loop in the plane. We show that a bound
state corresponding to a simple isolated eigenvalue acquires at that Berry's
phase equal to $2\pi {\rm sgn} e$ times the number of flux quanta through the
oriented area encircled by the loop. We also argue that this is a purely
quantum effect since the corresponding Hannay angle is zero.
