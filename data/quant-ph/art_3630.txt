The Liar-paradox in a Quantum Mechanical Perspective
In this paper we concentrate on the nature of the liar paradox as a cognitive
entity; a consistently testable configuration of properties. We elaborate
further on a quantum mechanical model [Aerts, Broekaert, Smets 1999] that has
been proposed to analyze the dynamics involved, and we focus on the
interpretation and concomitant philosophical picture. Some conclusions we draw
from our model favor an effective realistic interpretation of cognitive
reality.
