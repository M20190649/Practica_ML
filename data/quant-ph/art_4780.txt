Entanglement induced by a single-mode heat environment
A thermal field, which frequently appears in problems of decoherence,
provides us with minimal information about the field. We study the interaction
of the thermal field and a quantum system composed of two qubits and find that
such a chaotic field with minimal information can nevertheless entangle the
qubits which are prepared initially in a separable state. This simple model of
a quantum register interacting with a noisy environment allows us to understand
how memory of the environment affects the state of a quantum register.
