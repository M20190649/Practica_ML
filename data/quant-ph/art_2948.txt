Supersymmetric derivation of the hard core deuteron's bound state
A supersymmetric construction of potentials describing the hard core
interaction of the neutron-proton system for low energies is proposed. It
considers only the binding energy case and uses the approximation of the Yukawa
potential given by Hulthen. Recent experimental data for the binding energy of
the deuteron are used to give the involved orders of magnitude.
