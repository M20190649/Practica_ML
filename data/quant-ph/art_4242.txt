Characteristic decay of the autocorrelation functions prescribed by the
  Aharonov-Bohm time operator
The wave functions, the autocorrelation functions of which decay faster than
$t^{-2}$, for both the one-dimensional free particle system and the
repulsive-potential system are examined. It is then shown that such wave
functions constitute a dense subset of $L^2 ({\bf R}^1)$, under several
conditions that are particularly satisfied by the square barrier potential
system. It implies that the faster than $t^{-2}$-decay character of the
autocorrelation function persists against the perturbation of potential. It is
also seen that the denseness of the above subset is guaranteed by that of the
domain of the Aharonov-Bohm time operator.
