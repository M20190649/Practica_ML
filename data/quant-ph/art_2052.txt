Entanglement splitting of pure bipartite quantum states
The concept of entanglement splitting is introduced by asking whether it is
possible for a party possessing half of a pure bipartite quantum state to
transfer some of his entanglement with the other party to a third party. We
describe the unitary local transformation for symmetric and isotropic splitting
of a singlet into two branches that leads to the highest entanglement of the
output. The capacity of the resulting quantum channels is discussed. Using the
same transformation for less than maximally entangled pure states, the
entanglement of the resulting states is found. We discuss whether they can be
used to do teleportation and to test the Bell inequality. Finally we generalize
to entanglement splitting into more than two branches.
