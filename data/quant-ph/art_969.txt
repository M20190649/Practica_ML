Homodyne measurement of exponential phase moments
It is shown that the exponential moments of the canonical phase can be
directly sampled from the data recorded in balanced homodyne detection.
Analytical expressions for the sampling functions are derived, which are valid
for arbitrary states and bridge the gap between quantum and classical phase.
The reconstruction of the canonical phase distribution from the experimentally
determined exponential moments is discussed.
