Quantum Channels and Simultaneous ID Coding
This paper is on identification of classical information by the use of
quantum channels. We focus on simultaneous ID codes which use measurements
being useful to identify an arbitrary message. We give a direct and a converse
part of the appropriate coding theorem.
