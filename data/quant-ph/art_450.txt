The Ion Trap Quantum Information Processor
An introductory review of the linear ion trap is given, with particular
regard to its use for quantum information processing. The discussion aims to
bring together ideas from information theory and experimental ion trapping, to
provide a resource to workers unfamiliar with one or the other of these
subjects. It is shown that information theory provides valuable concepts for
the experimental use of ion traps, especially error correction, and conversely
the ion trap provides a valuable link between information theory and physics,
with attendant physical insights. Example parameters are given for the case of
calcium ions. Passive stabilisation will allow about 200 computing operations
on 10 ions; with error correction this can be greatly extended.
