Reply to the comment of Y. Aharonov and L. Vaidman on ``Time asymmetry
  in quantum mechanics: a retrodiction paradox''
In the standard physical interpretation of quantum theory, prediction and
retrodiction are not symmetric. The opposite assertion by some authors results
from their use of non-standard interpretations of the theory.
