Quantum tomography as normalization of incompatible observations
Quantum states are successfully reconstructed using the maximum likelihood
estimation on the subspace where the measured projectors reproduce the identity
operator. Reconstruction corresponds to normalization of incompatible
observations. The proposed approach handles the noisy data corresponding to
realistic incomplete observation with finite resolution.
