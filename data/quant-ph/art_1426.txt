Calculation of Planetary Precession from Quantum-corrected Newton's
  Gravitation Law
With consideration of quantization of space, we relate Newton's gravitation
with the Second Law of thermodynamics. This leads to a correction to its
original form, which takes into consideration the role of classical
measurement. Our calculation shows this corrected form of gravitation can give
explanation for planetary precession.
