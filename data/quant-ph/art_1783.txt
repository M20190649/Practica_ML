A Beable Interpretation of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization Model
We extend the beable interpretation, due to Bell, to the continuous
spontaneous localization model (CSL). Results obtained by Vink are generalized
to the modified Schrodinger equation of Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini (GPR),
which allows a beable interpretation for position and momentum.
