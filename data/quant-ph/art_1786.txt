Stochastic Phase Space Localization for a Single Particle
We propose a feedback scheme to control the vibrational motion of a single
trapped particle based on indirect measurements of its position. It results the
possibility of a motional phase space uncertainty contraction, correponding to
cool the particle close to the motional ground state.
