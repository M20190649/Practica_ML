Coherent States for Transparent Potentials
Darboux transformation operators that produce multisoliton potentials are
analyzed as operators acting in a Hilbert space. Isometric correspondence
between Hilbert spaces of states of a free particle and a particle moving in a
soliton potential is established. It is shown that the Darboux transformation
operator is unbounded but closed and can not realize an isometric mapping
between Hilbert spaces. A quasispectral representation of such an operator in
terms of continuum bases is obtained. Different types of coherent states of a
multisoliton potential are introduced. Measures that realize the resolution of
the identity operator in terms of the projectors on the coherent states vectors
are calculated. It is shown that when these states are related with free
particle coherent states by a bounded symmetry operator the measure is defined
by ordinary functions and in the case of a semibounded symmetry operator the
measure is defined by a generalized function.
