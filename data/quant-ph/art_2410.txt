Building multiparticle states with teleportation
We describe a protocol which can be used to generate any N-partite pure
quantum state using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. This protocol employs
only local operations and classical communication between the N parties
(N-LOCC). In particular, we rely on quantum data compression and teleportation
to create the desired state. This protocol can be used to obtain upper bounds
for the bipartite entanglement of formation of an arbitrary N-partite pure
state, in the asymptotic limit of many copies. We apply it to a few
multipartite states of interest, showing that in some cases it is not optimal.
Generalizations of the protocol are developed which are optimal for some of the
examples we consider, but which may still be inefficient for arbitrary states.
