The Dirac algebra and grand unification
A representation of the Dirac algebra, derived from first principles, can be
related to the combinations of unit charges which determine particle
structures. The algebraic structure derives from a broken symmetry between
4-vectors and quaternions which can be applied to the broken symmetry between
the three nongravitational interactions. The significance of this relation for
Grand Unification is derived by explicit calculation of the running values of
the fine structure constants, with suggestions for the calculation of particle
masses.
