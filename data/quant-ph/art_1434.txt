Wigner transform and quantum-like corrections for charged-particle beam
  transport
It is shown that charged-particle beam transport in the paraxial
approximation can be effectively described with a quantum-like picture in
semiclassical approximation. In particular, the classical Liouville equation
can be suitably replaced by a von Neuman-like equation. Relevant remarks
concerning the standard classical description of the beam transport are given.
