Quantum Algebraic Symmetries in Nuclei, Molecules and Atomic Clusters
Various applications of quantum algebraic techniques in nuclear structure
physics and in molecular physics are briefly reviewed and a recent application
of these techniques to the structure of atomic clusters is discussed in more
detail.
