Information and noise in photon entanglement
By using finite resolution measurements it is possible to simultaneously
obtain noisy information on two non-commuting polarization components of a
single photon. This method can be applied to a pair of entangled photons with
polarization statistics that violate Bell's inequalities. The theoretically
predicted results show that the non-classical nature of entanglement arises
from negative joint probabilities for the non-commuting polarization
components. These negative probabilities allow a "disentanglement" of the
statistics, providing new insights into the non-classical properties of quantum
information.
