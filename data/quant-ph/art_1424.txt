Supercoherent States of Calogero-Sutherland Oscillator
Supersymmetric quantum mechanical model of Calogero-Sutherlend singular
oscillator is constructed. Supercoherent states are defined with the help of
supergroup displacement operator. They are proper states of a fermionic
annihilation operator. Their coordinate and superholomorphic representations
are considered. The supermeasure on superunit disc which realizes the
resolution of the unity is calculated. The cases of exact and spontaneously
broken supersymmetry are treated separately. As an example the supersymmetric
partners of the input Hamiltonian expressed in terms of elementary functions
are given.
