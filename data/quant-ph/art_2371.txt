Stochastic control of quantum dynamics for a single trapped system
A stochastic control of the vibrational motion for a single trapped ion/atom
is proposed. It is based on the possibility to continously monitor the motion
through a light field meter. The output from the measurement process should be
then used to modify the system's dynamics.
