Decoherence effects of motion-induced radiation
The radiation pressure coupling with vacuum fluctuations gives rise to energy
damping and decoherence of an oscillating particle. Both effects result from
the emission of pairs of photons, a quantum effect related to the fluctuations
of the Casimir force. We discuss different alternative methods for the
computation of the decoherence time scale. We take the example of a spherical
perfectly-reflecting particle, and consider the zero and high temperature
limits. We also present short general reviews on decoherence and dynamical
Casimir effect.
