Imbedding nonlocality in a relativistic chronology
An alternative description imbedding nonlocality in a relativistic chronology
is proposed. It is argued that vindication of Quantum Mechanics in forthcoming
experiments with moving beam-splitters would mean that there is no real time
ordering behind the nonlocal correlations.
