Quantum Computation Based on Magic-Angle-Spinning Solid State Nuclear
  Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is shown to be a promising technique for implementing quantum
computing. The theory underlying the principles of quantum computing with
nuclear spin systems undergoing MAS is formulated in the framework of
formalized quantum Floquet theory. The procedures for realizing state labeling,
state transformation and coherence selection in Floquet space are given. It
suggests that by this method, the largest number of qubits can easily surpass
that achievable with other techniques. Unlike other modalities proposed for
quantum computing, this method enables one to adjust the dimension of the
working state space, meaning the number of qubits can be readily varied. The
universality of quantum computing in Floquet space with solid state NMR is
discussed and a demonstrative experimental implementation of Grover's search is
given.
