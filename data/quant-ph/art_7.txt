A general formulation of discrete-time quantum mechanics, restrictions
  on the action and the relation of unitarity to the existence theorem for
  initial-value problems
A general formlulation for discrete-time quantum mechanics, based on
Feynman's method in ordinary quantum mechanics, is presented. It is shown that
the ambiguities present in ordinary quantum mechanics (due to noncommutativity
of the operators), are no longer present here. Then the criteria for the
unitarity of the evolution operator is examined. It is shown that the unitarity
of the evolution operator puts restrictions on the form of the action, and also
implies the existence of a solution for the classical initial-value problem.
