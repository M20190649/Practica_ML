Quantization of electromagnetic field in inhomogeneous dispersive
  dielectrics
Canonical quantization of electromagnetic field inside the time--spatially
dispersive inhomogeneous dielectrics is presented. Interacting electromagnetic
and matter excitation fields create the closed system, Hamiltonian of which may
be diagonalized by generalized polariton transformation. Resulting dispersion
relations coincide with the classical ones obtained by the solution of wave
equation, the corresponding mode decomposition is, however, orthogonal and
complete in the enlarged Hilbert space.
