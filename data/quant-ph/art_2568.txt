Physical Interpretation of Laser-Induced Suppression of Quantum
  Tunneling
We revisit the problem of laser-induced suppression of quantum dynamical
tunneling in a model system studied by Kilin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76 (1996)
3297]. This quantum system consists of a ground state symmetric double-well
potential which is coupled by a strong laser field to an excited state
asymmetric double-well potential. By analyzing the assumptions used in their
analysis we show that the suppression of quantum dynamical tunneling can be
explained with the use of dark and bright states of the system. We also
generalize the system and the conditions for suppression of quantum tunneling
and show that, in certain cases, suppression can occur regardless the
characteristics of the excited potential surface.
