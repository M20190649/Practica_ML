A Beam Splitter for Guided Atoms on an Atom Chip
We have designed and experimentally studied a simple beam splitter for atoms
guided on an Atom Chip, using a current carrying Y-shaped wire and a bias
magnetic field. This beam splitter and other similar designs can be used to
build atom optical elements on the mesoscopic scale, and integrate them in
matterwave quantum circuits.
