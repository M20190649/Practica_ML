On the Relativistic Quantum Force
In the extension of the de-Broglie-Bohm causal quantum theory of motion to
the relativistic particles, one faces with serious problems, like the problem
of superluminal motion. This forces many authors to believe that there is not
any satisfactory causal theory for particles of integer spin. In this paper, it
is shown that the quantal behaviour is the result of
direct-particle-interaction of the particle with all of its possibilities. The
formulation is, then, extended to the relativistic particles of arbitrary spin.
The presented theory has the following advantages. (1) It leads to a deeper
understanding of the quantal behaviour. (2) It has no superluminal motion. (3)
It is applicable to any spin. (4) It provides a framework for understanding the
problem of creation and annihilation of particles. (5) It provides a framework
for understanding the spin-statistics relationship. (6) It does not need the
two fundamental assumptions of the de-Broglie-Bohm quantum theory of motion,
i.e., the guiding-formula postulate and the statistical postulate.
