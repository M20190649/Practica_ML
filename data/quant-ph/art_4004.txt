What Schr√∂dinger's Cat is Telling
The recent experiment on superconducting quantum interference device provides
new opportunity to clarify the fundamental interpretation of quantum mechanics.
After analyzing this and relevant experiments, we claim the point of view that
the quantum state in abstract sense contains no information and the wave
function is the probability amplitude of fictitious measurement corresponding
to the real one which is prepared to be done by the observer. Talking about the
quantum state or wave function too materialized in ordinary language would
often cause misunderstanding. So basically, the Schr\"odinger's cat paradox is
over.
