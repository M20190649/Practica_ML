Optimal Universal Disentangling Machine for Two Qubit Quantum States
We derive the optimal curve satisfied by the reduction factors, in the case
of universal disentangling machine which uses only local operations.
Impossibility of constructing a better disentangling machine, by using
non-local operations, is discussed.
