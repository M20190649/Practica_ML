On some algebraic problems arising in quantum mechanical description of
  biological systems
The biological hierarchy and the differences between living and non-living
systems are considered from the standpoint of quantum mechanics. The
hierarchical organization of biological systems requires hierarchical
organization of quantum states. The construction of the hierarchical space of
state vectors is presented. The application of similar structures to quantum
information processing is considered.
