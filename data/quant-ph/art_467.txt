Scattering in one dimension: The coupled Schroedinger equation,
  threshold behaviour and Levinson's theorem
We formulate scattering in one dimension due to the coupled Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in terms of the $S$ matrix, the unitarity of which leads to
constraints on the scattering amplitudes. Levinson's theorem is seen to have
the form $\eta(0) = \pi (n_b + 1/2 n - 1/2 N)$, where $\eta(0)$ is the phase of
the $S$ matrix at zero energy, $n_b$ the number of bound states with nonzero
binding energy, $n$ the number of half-bound states, and $N$ the number of
coupled equations. In view of the effects due to the half-bound states, the
threshold behaviour of the scattering amplitudes is investigated in general,
and is also illustrated by means of particular potential models.
