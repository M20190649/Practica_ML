Exactly Solvable Model of Quantum Spin Interacting with Spin Environment
An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin interacting with a spin
environment is considered. The interaction is chosen to be such that the state
of the environment is conserved. The reduced density matrix of the spin is
calculated for arbitrary coupling strength and arbitrary time. The stationary
state of the spin is obtained explicitely in the $t \to \infty$ limit.
