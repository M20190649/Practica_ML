Quantum Computing with Neutral Atoms in an Optical Lattice
We present a proposal for quantum information processing with neutral atoms
trapped in optical lattices as qubits. Initialization and coherent control of
single qubits can be achieved with standard laser cooling and spectroscopic
techniques. We consider entangling two-qubit logic gates based on optically
induced dipole-dipole interactions, calculating a figure-of-merit for various
protocols. Massive parallelism intrinsic to the lattice geometry makes this an
intriguing system for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation.
