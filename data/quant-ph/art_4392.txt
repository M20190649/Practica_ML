Experimental long-lived entanglement of two macroscopic objects
Entanglement is considered to be one of the most profound features of quantum
mechanics. An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot
be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this
sense the entangled system is considered inseparable and nonlocal. It is
generally believed that entanglement manifests itself mostly in systems
consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the entanglement of two objects, each consisting of about 10^12
atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the two objects - more
precisely, two gas samples of cesium atoms - with a pulse of light, which
performs a non-local Bell measurement on collective spins of the samples. The
entangled spin state can be maintained for 0.5 millisecond. Besides being of
fundamental interest, the robust, long-lived entanglement of material objects
demonstrated here is expected to be useful in quantum information processing,
including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.
