Bohmian prediction about a two double-slit experiment and its
  disagreement with standard quantum mechanics
The significance of proposals that can predict different results for standard
and Bohmian quantum mechanics have been the subject of many discussions over
the years. Here, we suggest a particular experiment (a two double-slit
experiment) and a special detection process, that we call selective detection,
to distinguish between the two theories. Using our suggested experiment, it is
shown that the two theories predict different observable results at the
individual level for a geometrically symmetric arrangement. However, their
predictions are the same at the ensemble level. On the other hand, we have
shown that at the statistical level, if we use our selective detection, then
either the predictions of the two theories differ or where standard quantum
mechanics is silent or vague, Bohmian quantum mechanics makes explicit
predictions.
