Derivation of the Lindblad Generator Structure by use of the It√¥
  Stochastic Calculus
We use the It\^o stochastic calculus to give a simple derivation of the
Lindblad form for the generator of a completely positive density matrix
evolution, by specialization from the corresponding global form for a
completely positive map. As a by-product, we obtain a generalized generator for
a completely positive stochastic density matrix evolution.
