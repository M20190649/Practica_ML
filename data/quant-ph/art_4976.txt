Information extraction and quantum state distortions in continuous
  variable quantum teleportation
We analyze the loss of fidelity in continuous variable teleportation due to
non-maximal entanglement. It is shown that the quantum state distortions
correspond to the measurement back-action of a field amplitude measurement.
Results for coherent states and for photon number states are presented.
