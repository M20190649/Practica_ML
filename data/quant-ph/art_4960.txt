Exact, convergent periodic-orbit expansions of individual energy
  eigenvalues of regular quantum graphs
We present exact, explicit, convergent periodic-orbit expansions for
individual energy levels of regular quantum graphs. One simple application is
the energy levels of a particle in a piecewise constant potential. Since the
classical ray trajectories (including ray splitting) in such systems are
strongly chaotic, this result provides the first explicit quantization of a
classically chaotic system.
