Caldirola-Kanai Oscillator in Classical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
The quadrature distribution for the quantum damped oscillator is introduced
in the framework of the formulation of quantum mechanics based on the
tomography scheme. The probability distribution for the coherent and Fock
states of the damped oscillator is expressed explicitly in terms of Gaussian
and Hermite polynomials, correspondingly.
