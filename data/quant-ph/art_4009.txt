Simultaneous intraportation of many quantum states within the quantum
  computing network
A scheme is proposed for simultaneous intraportation of many unknown quantum
states within a quantum computing network. It is shown that our scheme, much
different from the teleportation in the strict sense, can be very similar to
the original teleportation proposal[Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 70} (1993)1895)] and the
efficiency of the scheme for quantum state transmission is very high. The
possible applications of our scheme are also discussed.
