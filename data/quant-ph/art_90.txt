A Simple Quantum Computer
We propose an implementation of a quantum computer to solve Deutsch's
problem, which requires exponential time on a classical computer but only
linear time with quantum parallelism. By using a dual-rail qubit representation
as a simple form of error correction, our machine can tolerate some amount of
decoherence and still give the correct result with high probability. The design
which we employ also demonstrates a signature for quantum parallelism which
unambiguously delineates the desired quantum behavior from the merely
classical. The experimental demonstration of our proposal using quantum optical
components calls for the development of several key technologies common to
single photonics.
