On the theory of the relativistic cross sections for stimulated
  bremsstrahlung on an arbitrary electrostatic potential in the strong
  electromagnetic field
On the base of relativistic generalized eikonal approximation wave function
the multiphoton cross sections of a Dirac particle bremsstrahlung on an
arbitrary electrostatic potential and strong laser radiation field are
presented. In the limit of the Born approximation the ultimate analytical
formulas for arbitrary polarization of electromagnetic wave have been obtained.
