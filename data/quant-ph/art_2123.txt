Exact Diagonalization of Two Quantum Models for the Damped Harmonic
  Oscillator
The damped harmonic oscillator is a workhorse for the study of dissipation in
quantum mechanics. However, despite its simplicity, this system has given rise
to some approximations whose validity and relation to more refined descriptions
deserve a thorough investigation. In this work, we apply a method that allows
us to diagonalize exactly the dissipative Hamiltonians that are frequently
adopted in the literature. Using this method we derive the conditions of
validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and show how this approximate
description relates to more general ones. We also show that the existence of
dissipative coherent states is intimately related to the RWA. Finally, through
the evaluation of the dynamics of the damped oscillator, we notice an important
property of the dissipative model that has not been properly accounted for in
previous works; namely, the necessity of new constraints to the application of
the factorizable initial conditions.
