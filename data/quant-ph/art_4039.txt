Michelson interferometer operating at effects of first order with
  respect to v/c
In the first version of this paper (arXiv: 1003.2899v1, 15.03.2010) there is
described first, traditional method of measuring the non-zero shift of
interference fringe in the Michelson interferometer, operating on the effects
of second order with respect to v/c, and are revealed hidden causes of the
failure to measure the shift of interference fringe in the period from 1881
till 1960. It is shown that at the latitude of Obninsk within a 24-hour
observation period the horizontal projection of aether wind velocity varies
from 140 km/s to 480 km/s. The second version of this paper (arXiv:
1003.2899v2, 15.04.2010) is supplemented with a second method of finding the
velocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease
in the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one
(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the
aether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there
persists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such
as to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that
it is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second
order. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the
first order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in
both arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after
reflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the
interference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of
dielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the
Earth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order
interferometer agrees with that found by the first two methods.
