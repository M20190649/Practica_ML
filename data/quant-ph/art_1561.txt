Quantum state transformation by dispersive and absorbing four-port
  devices
The recently derived input-output relations for the radiation field at a
dispersive and absorbing four-port device [T. Gruner and D.-G. Welsch, Phys.
Rev. A 54, 1661 (1996)] are used to derive the unitary transformation that
relates the output quantum state to the input quantum state, including
radiation and matter and without placing frequency restrictions. It is shown
that for each frequency the transformation can be regarded as a well-behaved
SU(4) group transformation that can be decomposed into a product of U(2) and
SU(2) group transformations. Each of them may be thought of as being realized
by a particular lossless four-port device. If for narrow-bandwidth radiation
far from the medium resonances the absorption matrix of the four-port device
can be disregarded, the well-known SU(2) group transformation for a lossless
device is recognized. Explicit formulas for the transformation of Fock-states
and coherent states are given.
