Polya States of Quantized Radiation Fields, their Algebraic
  Characterization and Nonclassical Properties
Polya states of single mode radiation field are proposed and their algebraic
characterization and nonclassical properties are investigated. They degenerate
to the binomial (atomic coherent) and negative binomial (Perelomov's su(1,1)
coherent) states in two different limits and further to the number, the
ordinary coherent and Susskind-Glogower phase states. The algebra involved turn
out to be a two-parameter deformation of both su(2) and su(1,1). Nonclassical
properties are investigated in detail.
