The Schrodinger Equation From a Quadratic Hamiltonian System
We regard the real and imaginary parts of the Schrodinger wave function as
canonical conjugate variables.With this pair of conjugate variables and some
other 2n pairs, we construct a quadratic Hamiltonian density. We then show that
the Schrodinger Equation follows from the Hamilton's Equation of motion when
the Planck frequency is much larger than the characteristic frequencies of the
Hamiltonian system. The Hamiltonian and the normal mode solutions coincide,
respectively, with the energy expectation value and the energy eigenstates of
the corresponding quantum mechanical system.
