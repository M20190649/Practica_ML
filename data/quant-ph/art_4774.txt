Nonlinear Micromechanical Casimir Oscillator
The Casimir force between uncharged metallic surfaces originates from quantum
mechanical zero point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate
that this quantum electrodynamical effect has a profound influence on the
oscillatory behavior of microstructures when surfaces are in close proximity
(<= 100 nm). Frequency shifts, hysteretic behavior and bistability caused by
the Casimir force are observed in the frequency response of a periodically
driven micromachined torsional oscillator.
