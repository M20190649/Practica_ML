Quantum BCH Codes
After a brief introduction to both quantum computation and quantum error
correction, we show how to construct quantum error-correcting codes based on
classical BCH codes. With these codes, decoding can exploit additional
information about the position of errors. This error model - the quantum
erasure channel - is discussed. Finally, parameters of quantum BCH codes are
provided.
