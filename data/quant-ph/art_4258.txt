Some Worlds of Quantum Theory
This paper assesses the Everettian approach to the measurement problem,
especially the version of that approach advocated by Simon Saunders and David
Wallace. I emphasise conceptual, indeed metaphysical, aspects rather than
technical ones; but I include an introductory exposition of decoherence. In
particular, I discuss whether -- as these authors maintain -- it is acceptable
to have no precise definition of 'branch' (in the Everettian kind of sense).
