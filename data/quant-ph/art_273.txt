Hypercomplex quantum mechanics
The fundamental axioms of the quantum theory do not explicitly identify the
algebraic structure of the linear space for which orthogonal subspaces
correspond to the propositions (equivalence classes of physical questions). The
projective geometry of the weakly modular orthocomplemented lattice of
propositions may be imbedded in a complex Hilbert space; this is the structure
which has traditionally been used. This paper reviews some work which has been
devoted to generalizing the target space of this imbedding to Hilbert modules
of a more general type. In particular, detailed discussion is given of the
simplest generalization of the complex Hilbert space, that of the quaternion
Hilbert module.
