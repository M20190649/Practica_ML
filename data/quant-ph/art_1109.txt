A reductionistic approach to quantum computation
In the reductionistic approach, mechanisms are divided into simpler parts
interconnected in some standard way (e.g. by a mechanical transmission). We
explore the possibility of porting reductionism in quantum operations.
Conceptually, first parts are made independent of each other by assuming that
all ``transmissions'' are removed. The overall state would thus become a
superposition of tensor products of the eigenstates of the independent parts.
Transmissions are restored by projecting off all the tensor products which
violate them. This would be performed by particle statistics; the plausibility
of this scheme is based on the interpretation of particle statistics as
projection. The problem of the satisfiability of a Boolean network is
approached in this way. This form of quantum reductionism appears to be able of
taming the quantum whole without clipping its richness.
