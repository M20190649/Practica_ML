Error Avoiding Quantum Codes
The existence is proved of a class of open quantum systems that admits a
linear subspace ${\cal C}$ of the space of states such that the restriction of
the dynamical semigroup to the states built over $\cal C$ is unitary. Such
subspace allows for error-avoiding (noiseless) enconding of quantum
information.
