An Analog Analogue of a Digital Quantum Computation
We solve a problem, which while not fitting into the usual paradigm, can be
viewed as a quantum computation. Suppose we are given a quantum system
described by an N dimensional Hilbert space with a Hamiltonian of the form $E
|w >< w|$ where $| w>$ is an unknown (normalized) state. We show how to
discover $| w >$ by adding a Hamiltonian (independent of $| w >$) and evolving
for a time proportional to $N^{1/2}/E$. We show that this time is optimally
short. This process is an analog analogue to Grover's algorithm, a computation
on a conventional (!) quantum computer which locates a marked item from an
unsorted list of N items in a number of steps proportional to $N^{1/2}$.
