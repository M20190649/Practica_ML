Error sensitivity of a Quantum Simulator I: a first example
As the first useful Quantum Computers will be quantum simulators, here the
minimum number of qubits necessary for the solution of the Schroedinger
equation in simple test problems is evaluated. From the present preliminary
results it appears that it is possible to realize a useful quantum simulator
with a register of only 10-15 qbits. The intrinsic sensitivity to some errors
appears to be moderate without the need of error correcting methods. At present
there is at least some indication that the amplitude errors are more dangerous
than phase and decoherence errors. So corrections limited to amplitude errors
may be very useful.
