Quantum mechanical probabilities and general probabilistic constraints
  for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments
Relativistic causality, namely, the impossibility of signaling at
superluminal speeds, restricts the kinds of correlations which can occur
between different parts of a composite physical system. Here we establish the
basic restrictions which relativistic causality imposes on the joint
probabilities involved in an experiment of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm
type. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, places further restrictions beyond
those required by general considerations like causality and consistency. We
illustrate this fact by considering the sum of correlations involved in the
CHSH inequality. Within the general framework of the CHSH inequality, we also
consider the nonlocality theorem derived by Hardy, and discuss the constraints
that relativistic causality, on the one hand, and quantum mechanics, on the
other hand, impose on it. Finally, we derive a simple inequality which can be
used to test quantum mechanics against general probabilistic theories.
