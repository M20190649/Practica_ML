Positioning and clock synchronization through entanglement
A method is proposed to employ entangled and squeezed light for determining
the position of a party and for synchronizing distant clocks. An accuracy gain
over analogous protocols that employ classical resources is demonstrated and a
quantum-cryptographic positioning application is given, which allows only
trusted parties to learn the position of whatever must be localized. The
presence of a lossy channel and imperfect photodetection is considered. The
advantages in using partially entangled states is discussed.
