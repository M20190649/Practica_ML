Quantum error avoiding codes versus quantum error correcting codes
A general theory of quantum error avoiding codes is established, and new
light is shed on the relation between quantum error avoiding and correcting
codes. Quantum error avoiding codes are found to be a special type of highly
degenerate quantum error correcting codes. A combination of the ideas of
correcting and avoiding quantum errors may yield better codes. We give a
practical example.
