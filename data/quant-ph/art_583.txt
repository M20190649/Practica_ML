Alternative approach to electromagnetic field quantization in nonlinear
  and inhomogeneous media
A simple approach is proposed for the quantization of the electromagnetic
field in nonlinear and inhomogeneous media. Given the dielectric function and
nonlinear susceptibilities, the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field is
determined completely by this quantization method. From Heisenberg's equations
we derive Maxwell's equations for the field operators. When the nonlinearity
goes to zero, this quantization method returns to the generalized canonical
quantization procedure for linear inhomogeneous media [Phys. Rev. A, 43, 467,
1991]. The explicit Hamiltonians for the second-order and third-order nonlinear
quasi-steady-state processes are obtained based on this quantization procedure.
