A General Fidelity Limit for Quantum Channels
We derive a general limit on the fidelity of a quantum channel conveying an
ensemble of pure states. Unlike previous results, this limit applies to
arbitrary coding and decoding schemes, including nonunitary decoding. This
establishes the converse of the quantum noiseless coding theorem for all such
schemes.
