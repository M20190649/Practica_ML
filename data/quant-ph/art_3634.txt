Decoherence and the rate of entropy production in chaotic quantum
  systems
We show that for an open quantum system which is classically chaotic (a
quartic double well with harmonic driving coupled to a sea of harmonic
oscillators) the rate of entropy production has, as a function of time, two
relevant regimes: For short times it is proportional to the diffusion
coefficient (fixed by the system--environment coupling strength). For longer
times (but before equilibration) there is a regime where the entropy production
rate is fixed by the Lyapunov exponent. The nature of the transition time
between both regimes is investigated.
