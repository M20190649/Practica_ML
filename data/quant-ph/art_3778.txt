Quantum Bayes rule
We state a quantum version of Bayes's rule for statistical inference and give
a simple general derivation within the framework of generalized measurements.
The rule can be applied to measurements on N copies of a system if the initial
state of the N copies is exchangeable. As an illustration, we apply the rule to
N qubits. Finally, we show that quantum state estimates derived via the
principle of maximum entropy are fundamentally different from those obtained
via the quantum Bayes rule.
