Space-time counterfactuals
A definition is proposed to give precise meaning to the counterfactual
statements that often appear in discussions of the implications of quantum
mechanics. Of particular interest are counterfactual statements which involve
events occurring at space-like separated points, which do not have an absolute
time ordering. Some consequences of this definition are discussed.
