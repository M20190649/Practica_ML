On the Stronger Statement of Levinson's Theorem for the Dirac Equation
Recently a stronger statement of Levinson's theorem for the Dirac equation
was presented, where the limits of the phase shifts at $E=\pm M$ are related to
the numbers of nodes of radial functions at the same energies, respectively.
However, in this letter we show that this statement has to be modified because
the limits of the phase shifts may be negative for the Dirac equation.
