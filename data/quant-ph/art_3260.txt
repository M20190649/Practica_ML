Quantum Computation with hot and cold ions:An assessment of proposed
  schemes
We present a brief critical review of the proposals for quantum computation
with trapped ions, with particular emphasis on the possibilities for quantum
computation without the need for cooling to the quantum ground state of the
ions' collective oscillatory modes.
