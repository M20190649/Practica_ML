Semiclassical Green Function in Mixed Spaces
A explicit formula on semiclassical Green functions in mixed position and
momentum spaces is given, which is based on Maslov's multi-dimensional
semiclassical theory. The general formula includes both coordinate and momentum
representations of Green functions as two special cases of the form.
