Catalysis in non--local quantum operations
We show how entanglement can be used, without being consumed, to accomplish
unitary operations that could not be performed with out it. When applied to
infinitesimal transformations our method makes equivalent, in the sense of
Hamiltonian simulation, a whole class of otherwise inequivalent two-qubit
interactions. The new catalysis effect also implies the asymptotic equivalence
of all such interactions.
