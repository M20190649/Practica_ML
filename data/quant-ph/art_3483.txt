Rigged Hilbert spaces and time-asymmetry: the case of the upside-down
  simple harmonic oscillator
The upside-down simple harmonic oscillator system is studied in the contexts
of quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics. It is shown that in
order to study in a simple manner the creation and decay of a physical system
by ways of Gamow vectors we must formulate the theory in a time-asymmetric
fashion, namely using two different rigged Hilbert spaces to describe states
evolving towards the past and the future. The spaces defined in the contexts of
quantum and classical statistical mechanics are shown to be directly related by
the Wigner function.
