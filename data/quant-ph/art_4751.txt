Nonstationary Casimir effect in cavities with two resonantly coupled
  modes
We study the peculiarities of the nonstationary Casimir effect (creation of
photons in cavities with moving boundaries) in the special case of two
resonantly coupled modes with frequencies $\omega_0$ and $(3\Delta)\omega_0$,
parametrically excited due to small amplitude oscillations of the ideal cavity
wall at the frequency $2\omega_0(1\delta)$ (with $|\delta|,|\Delta|\ll 1$). The
effects of thermally induced oscillations in time dependences of the mean
numbers of created photons and the exchange of quantum purities between the
modes are discovered. Squeezing and photon distributions in each modes are
calculated for initial vacuum and thermal states. A possibility of compensation
of detunings is shown.
