The 3-Dimensional q-Deformed Harmonic Oscillator and Magic Numbers of
  Alkali Metal Clusters
Magic numbers predicted by a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator
with Uq(3) > SOq(3) symmetry are compared to experimental data for alkali metal
clusters, as well as to theoretical predictions of jellium models, Woods--Saxon
and wine bottle potentials, and to the classification scheme using the 3n+l
pseudo quantum number. The 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator
correctly predicts all experimentally observed magic numbers up to 1500 (which
is the expected limit of validity for theories based on the filling of
electronic shells), thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension
of the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic
oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of alkali
metal clusters.
