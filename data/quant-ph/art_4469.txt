Pairwise entanglement in symmetric multi-qubit systems
The concurrence, a quantitative measure of the entanglement between a pair of
particles, is determined for the case where the pair is extracted from a
symmetric state of N two-level systems. Examples are given for both pure and
mixed states of the N-particle system, and for a pair extracted from two
ensembles with correlated collective spins.
