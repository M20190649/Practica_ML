Experimental test of non-local quantum correlation in relativistic
  configurations
We report on a new kind of experimental investigations of the tension between
quantum nonlocally and relativity. Entangled photons are sent via an optical
fiber network to two villages near Geneva, separated by more than 10 km where
they are analyzed by interferometers. The photon pair source is set as
precisely as possible in the center so that the two photons arrive at the
detectors within a time interval of less than 5 ps (corresponding to a path
length difference of less than 1 mm). One detector is set in motion so that
both detectors, each in its own inertial reference frame, are first to do the
measurement! The data always reproduces the quantum correlations, making it
thus more difficult to consider the projection postulate as a compact
description of real collapses of the wave-function.
