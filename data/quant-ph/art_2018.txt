On the Path Integral of the Relativistic Electron
We revisit the path integral description of the motion of a relativistic
electron. Applying a minor but well motivated conceptional change to Feynman's
chessboard model, we obtain exact solutions of the Dirac equation. The
calculation is performed by means of a particular simple method different from
both the combinatorial approach envisaged by Feynman and its Ising model
correspondence.
