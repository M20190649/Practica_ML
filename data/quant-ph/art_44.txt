Quantum Cryptography with Coherent States
The safety of a quantum key distribution system relies on the fact that any
eavesdropping attempt on the quantum channel creates errors in the
transmission. For a given error rate, the amount of information that may have
leaked to the eavesdropper depends on both the particular system and the
eavesdropping strategy. In this work, we discuss quantum cryptographic
protocols based on the transmission of weak coherent states and present a new
system, based on a symbiosis of two existing ones, and for which the
information available to the eavesdropper is significantly reduced. This system
is therefore safer than the two previous ones. We also suggest a possible
experimental implementation.
