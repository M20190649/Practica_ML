Quantum fluctuations for drag free geodesic motion
The drag free technique is used to force a proof mass to follow a geodesic
motion. The mass is protected from perturbations by a cage, and the motion of
the latter is actively controlled to follow the motion of the proof mass. We
present a theoretical analysis of the effects of quantum fluctuations for this
technique. We show that a perfect drag free operation is in principle possible
at the quantum level, in spite of the back action exerted on the mass by the
position sensor.
