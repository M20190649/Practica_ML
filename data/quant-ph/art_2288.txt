A Realizable, Non-Null Schroedinger's Cat Experiment
Working from the Schroedinger's Cat paradigm, a series of experiments are
constructed. The Bedford-Wang experiment is examined, and the ambiguity in its
meaning is addressed. We eliminate this ambiguity by abandoning the idea of the
triggering event, replacing the two-state system with a mirror that undergoes
wave packet spreading. This creates an experimentally testable version of a
modified Schroedinger's Cat experiment for which a null result is not the
obvious outcome.
