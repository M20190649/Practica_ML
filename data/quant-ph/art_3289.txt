Renormalization Group at finite temperature in Quantum Mechanics
We establish the exact renormalization group equation for the potential of a
one quantum particle system at finite and zero temperature. As an example we
use it to compute the ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator. We
comment on an improvement of the Feynman Kleinert's variational method by the
renormalization group.
