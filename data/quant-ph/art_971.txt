Extension of the Barut-Girardello Coherent State and Path Integral II
We have constructed the coherent state of $U(N,1)$, which is an extension of
the Barut-Girardello (BG) coherent state of $SU(1,1)$, in our previous paper.
However there is a restriction that the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator is
natural number. In this paper we construct the coherent state in the analytic
representation to overcome this restriction. Next we show that the measure of
the BG coherent state is not the symplectic induced measure.
