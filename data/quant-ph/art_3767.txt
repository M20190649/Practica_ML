Uncertainty Relations for Entangled States
A generalized uncertainty relation for an entangled pair of particles is
obtained if we impose a symmetrization rule for all operators that we should
use when doing any calculation using the entangled wave function of the pair.
This new relation reduces to Heisenberg's uncertainty relation when the
particles have no correlation and suggests that we can have new lower bounds
for the product of position and momentum dispersions.
