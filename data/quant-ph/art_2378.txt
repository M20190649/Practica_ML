Degenerate space-time paths and the non-locality of quantum mechanics in
  a Clifford substructure of space-time
The quantized canonical space-time coordinates of a relativistic point
particle are expressed in terms of the elements of a complex Clifford algebra
which combines the complex properties of SL(2.C) and quantum mechanics. When
the quantum measurement principle is adapted to the generating space of the
Clifford algebra we find that the transition probabilities for twofold
degenerate paths in space-time equals the transition amplitudes for the
underlying paths in Clifford space. This property is used to show that the
apparent non-locality of quantum mechanics in a double slit experiment and in
an EPR type of measurement is resolved when analyzed in terms of the full paths
in the underlying Clifford space. We comment on the relationship of this model
to the time symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics and to the
Wheeler-Feynman model.
