PT-symetrically regularized Eckart,Poeschl-Teller and Hulthen potentials
Version 1: The well known Eckart's singular s-wave potential is
PT-symmetrically regularized and continued to the whole real line. The new
model remains exactly solvable and its bound states remain proportional to
Jacobi polynomials. Its real and discrete spectrum exhibits several unusual
features.
  Version 2: Parity times time-reversal symmetry of complex Hamiltonians with
real spectra is usually interpreted as a weaker mathematical substitute for
Hermiticity. Perhaps an equally important role is played by the related
strengthened analyticity assumptions. In a constructive illustration we
complexify a few potentials solvable only in s-wave. Then we continue their
domain from semi-axis to the whole axis and get the new exactly solvable
models. Their energies come out real as expected. The new one-dimensional
spectra themselves differ quite significantly from their s-wave predecessors.
