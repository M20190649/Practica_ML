Bose-Einstein Correlations and Sonoluminescence
Sonoluminescence may be studied in detail by intensity correlations among the
emitted photons. As an example, we discuss an experiment to measure the size of
the light-emitting region by the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect. We show that
single bubble sonoluminescence is almost ideally suited for study by this
method and that plausible values for the physical parameters are within easy
experimental reach. A sequence of two and higher order photon correlation
experiments is outlined.
