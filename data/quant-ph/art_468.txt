A non group theoretic proof of completeness of arbitrary coherent states
  $D(Î±)\mid f>$
A new proof for the completeness of the coherent states $D(\alpha )\mid f>$
for the Heisenberg Weyl group and the groups $SU(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$ is
presented. Generalizations of these results and their consequences are
disussed.
