Quantum stochastic resonance in driven spin-boson system with stochastic
  limit approximation
After a brief review of stochastic limit approximation with spin-boson system
from physical points of view, amplification phenomenon-stochastic resonance
phenomenon-in driven spin-boson system is observed which is helped by the
quantum white noise introduced through the stochastic limit approximation. The
shift in frequency of the system due to the interaction with the
environment-Lamb shift-has an important role in these phenomena.
