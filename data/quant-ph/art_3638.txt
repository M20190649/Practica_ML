Entangling operations and their implementation using a small amount of
  entanglement
We study when a physical operation can produce entanglement between two
systems initially disentangled. The formalism we develop allows to show that
one can perform certain non-local operations with unit probability by
performing local measurement on states that are weakly entangled.
