Mixed-state twin observables
Twin observables, i.e. opposite subsystem observables A+ and A- that are
indistinguishable in measurement in a given mixed or pure state W, are
investigated in detail algebraicly and geometrically. It is shown that there is
a far-reaching correspondence between the detectable (in W) spectral entities
of the two operators. Twin observables are state-dependently quantum-logically
equivalent, and direct subsystem measurement of one of them ipso facto gives
rise to the indirect (i.e. distant) measurement of the other. Existence of
nontrivial twins requires singularity of W. Systems in thermodynamic
equilibrium do not admit subsystem twins. These observables may enable one to
simplify the matrix representing W.
