Degrees of controllability for quantum systems and applications to
  atomic systems
Precise definitions for different degrees of controllability for quantum
systems are given, and necessary and sufficient conditions are discussed. The
results are applied to determine the degree of controllability for various
atomic systems with degenerate energy levels and transition frequencies.
