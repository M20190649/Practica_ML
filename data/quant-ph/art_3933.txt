Unitary transformations for testing Bell inequalities
It is shown that optical experimental tests of Bell inequality violations can
be described by SU(1,1) transformations of the vacuum state, followed by photon
coincidence detections. The set of all possible tests are described by various
SU(1,1) subgroups of Sp(8,$\Bbb R$). In addition to establishing a common
formalism for physically distinct Bell inequality tests, the similarities and
differences of post--selected tests of Bell inequality violations are also made
clear. A consequence of this analysis is that Bell inequality tests are
performed on a very general version of SU(1,1) coherent states, and the
theoretical violation of the Bell inequality by coincidence detection is
calculated and discussed. This group theoretical approach to Bell states is
relevant to Bell state measurements, which are performed, for example, in
quantum teleportation.
