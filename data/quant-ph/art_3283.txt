Long Distance, Unconditional Teleportation of Atomic States Via Complete
  Bell State Measurements
This paper proposes a scheme for creating and storing quantum entanglement
over long distances. Optical cavities that store this long-distance
entanglement in atoms could then function as nodes of a quantum network, in
which quantum information is teleported from cavity to cavity. The
teleportation can be carried out unconditionally via measurements of all four
Bell states, using a method of sequential elimination.
