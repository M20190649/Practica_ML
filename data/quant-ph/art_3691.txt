Generalization of Grover's Algorithm to Multiobject Search in Quantum
  Computing, Part II: General Unitary Transformations
There are major advantages in a newer version of Grover's quantum algorithm
utilizing a general unitary transformation in the search of a single object in
a large unsorted database. In this paper, we generalize this algorithm to
multiobject search. We show the techniques to achieve the reduction of the
problem to one on an invariant subspace of dimension just equal to two.
