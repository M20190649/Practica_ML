Comment on ``Resonant Spectra and the Time Evolution of the Survival and
  Nonescape Probabilities''
In [G. Garcia-Calderon, J. L. Mateos, and M. Moshinsky, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74,
337 (1995)], the time evolution of the quantum decay of a state initially
located within an interaction region of finite range was investigated. In
particular, it was shown that the survival and nonescape probabilities behave
differently at very large times. The purpose of this Comment is to show that
they have the same asymptotic behavior.
