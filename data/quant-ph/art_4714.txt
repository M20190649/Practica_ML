A polynomial-time solution to the parity problem on an NMR quantum
  computer
An efficient quantum algorithm is proposed to solve in polynomial time the
parity problem, one of the hardest problems both in conventional quantum
computation and in classical computation, on NMR quantum computers. It is based
on the quantum parallelism principle in a quantum ensemble, the selective
decoherence manipulation, and the NMR phase-sensitive measurement. The quantum
circuit for the quantum algorithm is designed explicitly.
