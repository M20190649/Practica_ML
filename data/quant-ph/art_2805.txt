Distinguishability of States and von Neumann Entropy
Consider an ensemble of pure quantum states |\psi_j>, j=1,...,n taken with
prior probabilities p_j respectively. We show that it is possible to increase
all of the pairwise overlaps |<\psi_i|\psi_j>| i.e. make each constituent pair
of the states more parallel (while keeping the prior probabilities the same),
in such a way that the von Neumann entropy S is increased, and dually, make all
pairs more orthogonal while decreasing S. We show that this phenomenon cannot
occur for ensembles in two dimensions but that it is a feature of almost all
ensembles of three states in three dimensions. It is known that the von Neumann
entropy characterises the classical and quantum information capacities of the
ensemble and we argue that information capacity in turn, is a manifestation of
the distinguishability of the signal states. Hence our result shows that the
notion of distinguishability within an ensemble is a global property that
cannot be reduced to considering distinguishability of each constituent pair of
states.
