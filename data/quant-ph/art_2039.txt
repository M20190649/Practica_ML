Deterministic Bell states and measurement of the motional state of two
  trapped ions
We present a method for the deterministic generation of all the electronic
Bell states of two trapped ions. It involves the combination of a purely
dispersive with a resonant laser excitation of vibronic transitions of the
ions. In contrast to other methods presented up to now, our proposal does not
require differential laser addressing of the individual ions and may be easily
implemented with present available techniques. It is further shown that this
excitation scheme is highly adequate for the complete determination of the
motional state of the ions.
