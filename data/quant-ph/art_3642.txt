Joint measurements via quantum cloning
We explore the possibility of achieving optimal joint measurements of
noncommuting observables on a single quantum system by performing conventional
measurements of commuting self adjoint operators on optimal clones of the
original quantum system. We consider the case of both finite dimensional and
infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In the former we study the joint
measurement of three orthogonal components of a spin 1/2, in the latter we
consider the case of the joint measurements of any pair of noncommuting
quadratures of one mode of the electromagnetic field. We show that universally
covariant cloning is not ideal for joint measurements, and a suitable non
universally covariant cloning is needed.
