Quantum Statistics of Hydrogen in Strong Magnetic Fields
By an extension of the Feynman-Kleinert variational approach, we calculate
the temperature-dependent effective classical potential governing the quantum
statistical properties of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field. In the
zero-temperature limit, we obtain ground state energies which are accurate for
all magnetic field strengths from weak to strong fields.
