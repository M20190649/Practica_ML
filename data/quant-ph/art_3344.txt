Probability in Orthodox Quantum Mechanics: Probability as a Postulate
  Versus Probability as an Emergent Phenomenon
The role of probability in quantum mechanics is reviewed, with a discussion
of the ``orthodox'' versus the statistical interpretive frameworks, and of a
number of related issues. After a brief summary of sources of unease with
quantum mechanics, a survey is given of attempts either to give a new
interpretive framework assuming quantum mechanics is exact, or to modify
quantum mechanics assuming it is a very accurate approximation to a more
fundamental theory. This survey focuses particularly on the issues of whether
probabilities in quantum mechanics are postulated or emergent.
