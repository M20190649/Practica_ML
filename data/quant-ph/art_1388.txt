The Particle in the box: Intermode traces in the propagator
Characteristic structures such as canals and ridges --intermode traces--
emerge in the spacetime representation of the probability distribution of a
particle in a one-dimensional box. We show that the corresponding propagator
already contains these structures. We relate their visibility to the
factorization property of the initial wave packet.
