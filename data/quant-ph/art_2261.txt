Phase transitions and the internal noise structure of nonlinear
  Schr√∂di nger equation solitons
We predict phase-transitions in the quantum noise characteristics of systems
described by the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, showing them to be
related to the solitonic field transition at half the fundamental soliton
amplitude. These phase-transitions are robust with respect to Raman noise and
scattering losses. We also describe the rich internal quantum noise structure
of the solitonic fields in the vicinity of the phase-transition. For optical
coherent quantum solitons, this leads to the prediction that eliminating the
peak side-band noise due to the electronic nonlinearity of silica fiber by
spectral filtering leads to the optimal photon-number noise reduction of a
fundamental soliton.
