Hypercrystalline vacua
Let a quantum network be a Fermi-Dirac assembly of Fermi-Dirac assemblies of
...of quantum points, interpreted topologically. The simplest quantum-network
vacuum modes with exact conservation of relativistic energy-momentum and
angular momentum also support the local non-Abelian groups of the standard
model, torsion and gravity. The spacetime points of these models naturally obey
parastatistics. We construct a left-handed vacuum network among others.
