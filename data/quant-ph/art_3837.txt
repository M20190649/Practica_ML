Experiments towards Falsification of Noncontextual Hidden Variable
  Theories
We present two experiments testing the hypothesis of noncontextual hidden
variables (NCHV's). The first one is based on observation of two-photon
pseudo-Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger correlations, with two of the originally
three particles mimicked by the polarization degree of freedom and the spatial
degree of freedom of a single photon. The second one, a single-photon
experiment, utilizes the same trick to emulate two particle correlations, and
is an "event ready" test of a Bell-like inequality, derived from the
noncontextuality assumption. Modulo fair sampling, the data falsify NCHV's.
