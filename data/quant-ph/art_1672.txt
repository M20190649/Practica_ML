Variations on the Theme of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Proof
Three arguments based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) proof of the
nonexistence of local hidden variables are presented. The first is a
description of a simple game which a team that uses the GHZ method will always
win. The second uses counterfactuals in an attempt to show that quantum theory
is nonlocal in a stronger sense than is implied by the nonexistence of local
hidden variables and the third describes peculiar features of time-symmetrized
counterfactuals in quantum theory.
