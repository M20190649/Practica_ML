An arbitrated quantum signature scheme
The general principle for a quantum signature scheme is proposed and
investigated based on ideas from classical signature schemes and quantum
cryptography. The suggested algorithm is implemented by a symmetrical quantum
key cryptosystem and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) triplet states and
relies on the availability of an arbitrator. We can guarantee the unconditional
security of the algorithm, mostly due to the correlation of the GHZ triplet
states and the use of quantum one-time pads.
