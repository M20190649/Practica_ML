Darboux-Witten techniques for the Demkov-Ostrovsky problem
The bosonic strictly isospectral problem for Demkov-Ostrovsky (DO) effective
potentials in the radially nodeless sector is first solved in the
supersymmetric Darboux-Witten (DW) half line (or l-changing) procedure. As an
application, for the \kappa =1 class, if one goes back to optics examples, it
might be possible to think of a one-parameter family of Maxwell lenses having
the same optical scattering properties in the nodeless radial sector. Although
the relative changes in the index of refraction that one may introduce in this
way are at the level of several percents, at most, for all DO orbital quantum
numbers l\geq 0, the index profiles are different from the original Maxwell
one, possessing an inflection point within the lens. I pass then to the DW full
line (or N-changing) procedure, obtaining the corresponding Morse-type problem
for which the supersymmetric results are well established, and finally come
back to the half line with well-defined results
