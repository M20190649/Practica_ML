The deformed uncertainty relation and the corresponding beam quality
  factor
By using the theory of deformed quantum mechanics, we study the deformed
light beam theoretically. The deformed beam quality factor $M_q^2$ is given
explicitly under the case of deformed light in coherent state. When the
deformation parameter $q$ being a root of unity, the beam quality factor $M_q^2
\leq 1$.
