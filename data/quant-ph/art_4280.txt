Boole-Bell-type inequalities in Mathematica
Classical Pitowsky correlation polytopes are reviewed with particular
emphasis on the Minkowski-Weyl representation theorem. The inequalities
representing the faces of polytopes are Boole's ``conditions of possible
experience.'' Many of these inequalities have been discussed in the context of
Bell's inequalities. We introduce CddIF, a Mathematica package created as an
interface between Mathematica and the cdd program by Komei Fukuda, which
represents a highly efficient method to solve the hull problem for general
classical correlation polytopes.
