Path Integration on a Quantum Computer
We study path integration on a quantum computer that performs quantum
summation. We assume that the measure of path integration is Gaussian, with the
eigenvalues of its covariance operator of order j^{-k} with k>1. For the Wiener
measure occurring in many applications we have k=2. We want to compute an
$\e$-approximation to path integrals whose integrands are at least Lipschitz.
We prove:
  1. Path integration on a quantum computer is tractable.
  2. Path integration on a quantum computer can be solved roughly $\e^{-1}$
times faster than on a classical computer using randomization, and
exponentially faster than on a classical computer with a worst case assurance.
  3.The number of quantum queries is the square root of the number of function
values needed on a classical computer using randomization. More precisely, the
number of quantum queries is at most $4.22 \e^{-1}$. Furthermore, a lower bound
is obtained for the minimal number of quantum queries which shows that this
bound cannot be significantly improved.
  4.The number of qubits is polynomial in $\e^{-1}$. Furthermore, for the
Wiener measure the degree is 2 for Lipschitz functions, and the degree is 1 for
smoother integrands.
