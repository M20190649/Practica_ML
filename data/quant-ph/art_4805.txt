Continuous variable quantum cryptography using coherent states
We propose several methods for quantum key distribution (QKD) based upon the
generation and transmission of random distributions of coherent or squeezed
states, and we show that they are are secure against individual eavesdropping
attacks. These protocols require that the transmission of the optical line
between Alice and Bob is larger than 50 %, but they do not rely on
"non-classical" features such as squeezing. Their security is a direct
consequence of the no-cloning theorem, that limits the signal to noise ratio of
possible quantum measurements on the transmission line. Our approach can also
be used for evaluating various QKD protocols using light with gaussian
statistics.
