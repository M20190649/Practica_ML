Semiclassical Statistical Mechanics
We use a semiclassical approximation to derive the partition function for an
arbitrary potential in one-dimensional Quantum Statistical Mechanics, which we
view as an example of finite temperature scalar Field Theory at a point. We
rely on Catastrophe Theory to analyze the pattern of extrema of the
corresponding path-integral. We exhibit the propagator in the background of the
different extrema and use it to compute the fluctuation determinant and to
develop a (nonperturbative) semiclassical expansion which allows for the
calculation of correlation functions. We discuss the examples of the single and
double-well quartic anharmonic oscillators, and the implications of our results
for higher dimensions.
