ROM-based computation: quantum versus classical
We introduce a model of computation based on read only memory (ROM), which
allows us to compare the space-efficiency of reversible, error-free classical
computation with reversible, error-free quantum computation. We show that a
ROM-based quantum computer with one writable qubit is universal, whilst two
writable bits are required for a universal classical ROM-based computer. We
also comment on the time-efficiency advantages of quantum computation within
this model.
