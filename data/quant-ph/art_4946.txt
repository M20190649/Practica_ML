Cloning a Qutrit
We investigate several classes of state-dependent quantum cloners for
three-level systems. These cloners optimally duplicate some of the four
maximally-conjugate bases with an equal fidelity, thereby extending the
phase-covariant qubit cloner to qutrits. Three distinct classes of qutrit
cloners can be distinguished, depending on two, three, or four
maximally-conjugate bases are cloned as well (the latter case simply
corresponds to the universal qutrit cloner). These results apply to symmetric
as well as asymmetric cloners, so that the balance between the fidelity of the
two clones can also be analyzed.
