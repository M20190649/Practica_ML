Comment on "Demonstration of the Casimir Force in the 0.6 to 6
  micrometer Range"
We comment on a recently published measurement of the Casimir force for
distances in the 0.6 to 6 micrometer range between two Au surfaces (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 78, 5(1997)) and the net discrepancy reported for the comparison with
theoretical predictions (Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5475 (1998)).
