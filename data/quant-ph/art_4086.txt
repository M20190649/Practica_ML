Quantum measurements, Information, and Dual States Representations
The quantum measurement problem considered for the model of measuring system
(MS) consist of measured state S (particle), detector D and information
processing device (observer) $O$ interacting with S,D.
  For 'external' observer $O'$ MS evolution obeys to Schrodinger equation (SE)
and $O$ (self)description of MS reconstructed from it in Breuer ansatz. MS
irreversible evolution (state collapse) for $O$ can be obtained if the true
quantum states manifold has the dual structure $L_T=\cal {H} \bigotimes L_V$
where $\cal H$ is Hilbert space and $\cal L_V$ is the set with elements
$V^O=|O_j> < O_j|$ describing random 'pointer' outcomes $O_j$ observed by $O$
in the individual events. Possible experimental tests of this dual states
structure described. The results interpretation in Quantum Information
framework and Relational Quantum Mechanics discussed.
