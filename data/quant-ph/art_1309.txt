On Quantum Nonlocality: Using Prediction of a Distant Measurement
  Outcome
We assume that an event caused by a correlation between outcomes of two
causally separated measurements is, by definition, a manifestation of quantum
nonlocality, or superluminal influence. An example of the Alice-Bob type is
given, with the characters replaced. The relationship between quantum
nonlocality and relativity theory is touched upon.
