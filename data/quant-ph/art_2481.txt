Sufficient conditions for a disentanglement
We consider a disentanglement process in which local properties of an
entangled state are preserved, while the entanglement between the subsystems is
erased. Sufficient conditions for a perfect disentanglement (into product
states and into separable states) are derived, and connections to the
conditions for perfect cloning and for perfect broadcasting are observed.
