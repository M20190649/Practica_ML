Non-maximally entangled states: production, characterization and
  utilization
Using a spontaneous-downconversion photon source, we produce true
non-maximally entangled states, i.e., without the need for post-selection. The
degree and phase of entanglement are readily tunable, and are characterized
both by a standard analysis using coincidence minima, and by quantum state
tomography of the two-photon state. Using the latter, we experimentally
reconstruct the reduced density matrix for the polarization. Finally, we use
these states to measure the Hardy fraction, obtaining a result that is $122
\sigma$ from any local-realistic result.
