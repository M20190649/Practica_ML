Solvable potentials, non-linear algebras, and associated coherent states
Using the Darboux method and its relation with supersymmetric quantum
mechanics we construct all SUSY partners of the harmonic oscillator. With the
help of the SUSY transformation we introduce ladder operators for these partner
Hamiltonians and shown that they close a quadratic algebra. The associated
coherent states are constructed and discussed in some detail.
