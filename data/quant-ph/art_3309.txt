Quantum Computer as a Probabilistic Inference Engine
We propose a new class of quantum computing algorithms which generalize many
standard ones. The goal of our algorithms is to estimate probability
distributions. Such estimates are useful in, for example, applications of
Decision Theory and Artificial Intelligence, where inferences are made based on
uncertain knowledge. The class of algorithms that we propose is based on a
construction method that generalizes a Fredkin-Toffoli (F-T) construction
method used in the field of classical reversible computing. F-T showed how,
given any binary deterministic circuit, one can construct another binary
deterministic circuit which does the same calculations in a reversible manner.
We show how, given any classical stochastic network (classical Bayesian net),
one can construct a quantum network (quantum Bayesian net). By running this
quantum Bayesian net on a quantum computer, one can calculate any conditional
probability that one would be interested in calculating for the original
classical Bayesian net. Thus, we generalize the F-T construction method so that
it can be applied to any classical stochastic circuit, not just binary
deterministic ones. We also show that, in certain situations, our class of
algorithms can be combined with Grover's algorithm to great advantage.
