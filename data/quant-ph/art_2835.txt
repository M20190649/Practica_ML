Spin-Boson Hamiltonian and Optical Absorption of Molecular Dimers
An analysis of the eigenstates of a symmetry-broken spin-boson Hamiltonian is
performed by computing Bloch and Husimi projections. The eigenstate analysis is
combined with the calculation of absorption bands of asymmetric dimer
configurations constituted by monomers with nonidentical excitation energies
and optical transition matrix elements. Absorption bands with regular and
irregular fine structures are obtained and related to the transition from the
coexistence to a mixing of adiabatic branches in the spectrum. It is shown that
correlations between spin states allow for an interpolation between absorption
bands for different optical asymmetries.
