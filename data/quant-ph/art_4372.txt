Constraints on Eavesdropping on the BB84 Protocol
An undetected eavesdropping attack must produce count rate statistics that
are indistinguishable from those that would arise in the absence of such an
attack. In principle this constraint should force a reduction in the amount of
information available to the eavesdropper. In this paper we illustrate, by
considering a particular class of eavesdropping attacks, how the general
analysis of this problem may proceed.
