Trapping Quantum Coherence in Local Energy Minima
Clusters of solid-state quantum devices have long-living metastable states of
local energy minima which may be used to store quantum information. The low to
vanishing rate of dissipation fulfils the prerequisite to maintain quantum
coherence. Then physical symmetrization of the devices could minimize the
couplings of the clusters to environmental degrees of freedom so to reduce the
rate of decoherence. Combined with various other error correction mechanisms
and methods, such designs and optimizations could render solid-state devices
useful for quantum information processing, which have the advantages of
flexibility in state manipulation and system scaling.
