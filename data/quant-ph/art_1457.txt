Maximal violation of Bell's inequality and atomic cascade photons
A correlation inequality is derived from local realism and a supplementary
assumption. This inequality is violated by a factor of 1.5 in the case of real
experiments, whereas previous inequalities such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality of 1969 and Clauser-Horne inequality of 1974 are violated by a
factor of $\sqrt 2$. Thus the magnitude of violation of this inequality is
approximately 20.7% larger than the magnitude of violation of previous
inequalities. Moreover, the present inequality can be used to test locality
very simply because it requires the measurements of only two detection
probabilities. In contrast, Clauser-Horne inequality requires the measurements
of five detection probabilities.
