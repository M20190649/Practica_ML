Bipartite Mixed States of Infinite-Dimensional Systems are Generically
  Nonseparable
Given a bipartite quantum system represented by a tensor product of two
Hilbert spaces, we give an elementary argument showing that if either component
space is infinite-dimensional, then the set of nonseparable density operators
is trace-norm dense in the set of all density operators (and the separable
density operators nowhere dense). This result complements recent detailed
investigations of separability, which show that when both component Hilbert
spaces are finite-dimensional, there is a separable neighborhood (perhaps very
small for large dimensions) of the maximally mixed state.
