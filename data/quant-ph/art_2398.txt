Entanglement swapping using continuous variables
We investigate the efficacy with which entanglement can be teleported using a
continuous measurement scheme. We show that by using the correct gain for the
classical channel the degree of violation of locality that can be demonstrated
(using a CH type inequality) is {\it not} a function of the level of
entanglement squeezing used in the teleportation. This is possible because a
gain condition can always be choosen such that passage through the teleporter
is equivalent to pure attenuation of the input field.
