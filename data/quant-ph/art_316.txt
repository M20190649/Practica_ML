Homodyne detection for measuring internal quantum correlations of
  optical pulses
A new method is described for determining the quantum correlations at
different times in optical pulses by using balanced homodyne detection. The
signal pulse and sequences of ultrashort test pulses are superimposed, where
for chosen distances between the test pulses their relative phases and
intensities are varied from measurement to measurement. The correlation
statistics of the signal pulse is obtained from the time-integrated difference
photocurrents measured.
