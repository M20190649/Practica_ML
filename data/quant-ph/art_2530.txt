Nonclassical correlations in damped N-solitons
The quantum statistics of damped higher-order optical solitons are analyzed
numerically, using cumulant-expansion techniques in Gaussian approximation. A
detailed analysis of nonclassical properties in both the time and the frequency
domain is given, with special emphasis on the role of absorption. Highly
nonclassical broadband spectral correlation is predicted.
