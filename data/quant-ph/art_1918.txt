Locality Is An Unnecessary Assumption of Bell's Theorem
Without imposing the locality condition,it is shown that quantum mechanics
cannot reproduce all the predictions of a special stochastic realistic model
used in certain spin-correlation experiments.This shows that the so-called
locality condition is an unnecessary assumption of Bell's theorem.
