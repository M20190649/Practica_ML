Stochastic Resonance and Nonlinear Response by NMR Spectroscopy
We revisit the phenomenon of quantum stochastic resonance in the regime of
validity of the Bloch equations. We find that a stochastic resonance behavior
in the steady-state response of the system is present whenever the
noise-induced relaxation dynamics can be characterized via a single relaxation
time scale. The picture is validated by a simple nuclear magnetic resonance
experiment in water.
