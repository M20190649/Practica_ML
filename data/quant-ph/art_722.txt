Interferometry with Faraday mirrors for quantum cryptography
Quantum Cryptography over 23km of installed Telecom fiber using a novel
interferometer with Faraday mirrors is presented. The interferometer needs no
alignment nor polarization control and features 99.8% fringe visibility. A
secret key of 20kbit length with a error rate of 1.35% for 0.1 photon per pulse
was produced.
