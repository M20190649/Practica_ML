Added noise in homodyne measurement of field-observables
Homodyne tomography provides a way for measuring generic field-operators.
Here we analyze the determination of the most relevant quantities: intensity,
field, amplitude and phase. We show that tomographic measurements are affected
by additional noise in comparison with the direct detection of each observable
by itself. The case of of coherent states has been analyzed in details and
earlier estimations of tomographic precision are critically discussed.
