Coherent States of Non-Linear Lie algebras: Application in Quantum
  Optics
We present a general unified approach for finding the coherent states of
polynomially deformed algebras such as the quadratic and Higgs algebras, which
are relevant for various multiphoton processes in quantum optics. We give a
general procedure to map these deformed algebras to appropriate Lie algebras.
This is used, for the non compact cases, to obtain the annihilation operator
coherent states, by finding the canonical conjugates of these operators.
  Generalized coherent states, in the Perelomov sense also follow from this
construction. This allows us to explicitly construct coherent states associated
with various quantum optical systems.
