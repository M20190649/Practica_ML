Higher Order Gamow States with Exponential Decay
We derive Gamow vectors from S-matrix poles of higher multiplicity in analogy
to the Gamow vectors describing resonances from first-order poles. With these
vectors we construct a density operator that describes resonances associated
with higher order poles that obey an exponential decay law. It turns out that
this operator formed by these higher order Gamow vectors has a unique
structure.
