Coherent states for quantum systems with a trilinear boson Hamiltonian
We introduce a set of coherent states which are associated with quantum
systems governed by a trilinear boson Hamiltonian. These states are produced by
the action of a nonunitary displacement operator on a reference state and can
be equivalently defined by some eigenvalue equations. The system prepared
initially in the reference state will evolve into the coherent state during the
first instants of the interaction process. Some properties of the coherent
states are discussed. In particular, the resolution of the identity is derived
and the related analytic representation in the complex plane is developed. It
is shown that this analytic representation coincides with a double
representation based on the Glauber coherent states of the pump mode and on the
SU(1,1) Perelomov coherent states of the signal-idler system. Entanglement
between the field modes and photon statistics of the coherent states are
studied. Connections between the coherent states and the long-time evolution
induced by the trilinear Hamiltonian are considered.
