Relativistic Quantum Theory of Cyclotron Resonance in a Medium
In this paper the relativistic quantum theory of cyclotron resonance in an
arbitrary medium is presented. The quantum equation of motion for charged
particle in the field of plane electromagnetic wave and uniform magnetic field
in a medium is solved in the eikonal approximation. The probabilities of
induced multiphoton transitions between Landau levels in strong laser field is
calculated.
