Non-locality and quantum theory: new experimental evidence
Starting from the late 60's many experiments have been performed to verify
the violation Bell's inequality by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type
correlations. The idea of these experiments being that: (i) Bell's inequality
is a consequence of locality, hence its experimental violation is an indication
of non locality; (ii) this violation is a typical quantum phenomenon because
any classical system making local choices (either deterministic or random) will
produce correlations satisfying this inequality. Both statements (i) and (ii)
have been criticized by quantum probability on theoretical grounds (not
discussed in the present paper) and the experiment discussed below has been
devised to support these theoretical arguments. We emphasize that the goal of
our experiment is not to reproduce classically the EPR correlations but to
prove that there exist perfectly local classical dynamical systems violating
Bell's inequality.
