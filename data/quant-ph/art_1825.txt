Teleportation: Dream or Reality?
Since its discovery in 1993, we witness an intensive theoretical and
experimental effort centered on teleportation. Very recently it was claimed in
the press that ``quantum teleportation has been achieved in the laboratory''
(T. Sudbery, Nature, 390, p. 551). Here, I briefly review this research
focusing on the connection to nonlocal measurements, and question Sudbery's
statement. A philosophical inquiry about the paradoxical meaning of
teleportation in the framework of the many-worlds interpretation is added.
