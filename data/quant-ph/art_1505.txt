Levinson's Theorem for Non-local Interactions in Two Dimensions
In the light of the Sturm-Liouville theorem, the Levinson theorem for the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with both local and non-local cylindrically symmetric
potentials is studied. It is proved that the two-dimensional Levinson theorem
holds for the case with both local and non-local cylindrically symmetric cutoff
potentials, which is not necessarily separable. In addition, the problems
related to the positive-energy bound states and the physically redundant state
are also discussed in this paper.
