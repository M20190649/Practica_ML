On Quantum Mechanics
We discuss the axiomatic basis of quantum mechanics and show that it is
neither general nor consistent, since its axioms are incompatible with each
other and moreover it does not incorporate the magnetic quantization as in the
cyclotron motion. A general and consistent system of axioms is conjectured
which incorporates also the magnetic quantization.
