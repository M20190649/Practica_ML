Converse coding theorems for quantums source and noisy channel
The weak converse coding theorems have been proved for the quantum source and
channel. The results give the lower bound for capacity of source and the upper
bound for capacity of channel. The monotonicity of mutual quantum information
have also been proved. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz
