K-quantum Nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings Model in Two Trapped Ions
A k-quantum nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model for two trapped ions interacting
with laser beams resonant to k-th red side-band of center-of-mass mode, far
from Lamb-Dicke regime, has been obtained. The exact analytic solution showed
the existence of quantum collapses and revivals of the occupation of two atoms.
