About the Dirac Equation with a $Î´$ potential
An elementary treatment of the Dirac Equation in the presence of a
three-dimensional spherically symmetric $\delta (r-r_0)$-potential is
presented. We show how to handle the matching conditions in the configuration
space, and discuss the occurrence of supercritical effects.
