Does Schrodinger's Cat Know Something That Schrodinger Does Not Know?
Macroscopic objects appear to have definite positions. In a many-worlds
interpretation of quantum theory, this appearance is an illusion; the correct
view is the "view from outside" in which even macroscopic objects are in
general in a superposition of different positions. In the Bohm model, objects
really are in definite positions. This additional aspect of reality is
accessible only from the "inside"; thus in the Bohm model the view from inside
can be more correct than is the view from outside.
