On quantum teleportation with beam-splitter-generated entanglement
Following the lead of Cochrane, Milburn, and Munro [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62},
062307 (2000)], we investigate theoretically quantum teleportation by means of
the number-sum and phase-difference variables. We study Fock-state entanglement
generated by a beam splitter and show that two-mode Fock-state inputs can be
entangled by a beam splitter into close approximations of maximally entangled
eigenstates of the phase difference and the photon-number sum
(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen -- EPR -- states). Such states could be experimentally
feasible with on-demand single-photon sources. We show that the teleportation
fidelity can reach near unity when such ``quasi-EPR'' states are used as the
quantum channel.
