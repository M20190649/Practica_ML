Singlet aided infinite resource reduction in the comparison of distant
  fields
We present a task which can be faithfully solved with finite resources only
when aided by particles prepared in a particular entangled state: the singlet
state. The task consists of identifying the mutual parallelity or orthogonality
of weak distant magnetic fields whose absolute directions are completely
unknown.
