Asymptotic estimation theory for a finite dimensional pure state model
The optimization of measurement for n samples of pure sates are studied. The
error of the optimal measurement for n samples is asymptotically compared with
the one of the maximum likelihood estimators from n data given by the optimal
measurement for one sample.
