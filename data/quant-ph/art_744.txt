Monte Carlo Simulation of Quantum Computation
The many-body dynamics of a quantum computer can be reduced to the time
evolution of non-interacting quantum bits in auxiliary fields by use of the
Hubbard-Stratonovich representation of two-bit quantum gates in terms of
one-bit gates. This makes it possible to perform the stochastic simulation of a
quantum algorithm, based on the Monte Carlo evaluation of an integral of
dimension polynomial in the number of quantum bits. As an example, the
simulation of the quantum circuit for the Fast Fourier Transform is discussed.
