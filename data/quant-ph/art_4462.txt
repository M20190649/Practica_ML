Quantum Zeno-like effect due to competing decoherence mechanisms
We propose a selfconsistent quantum mechanical approach to study the dynamics
of a two-level system subject to random time evolution. This randomness gives
rise to competing effects between dissipative and non-dissipative decoherence
with a consequent slow down of the atomic decay rate.
