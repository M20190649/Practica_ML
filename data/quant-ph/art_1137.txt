Nonlocality and Bohr's reply to EPR
Henry Stapp's commentary (quant-ph/9711060) does not capture the point I was
trying to make in my essay (quant-ph/9711052) on how a subtle flaw in his
``proof of quantum nonlocality'' clearly illustrates a central issue in Bohr's
reply to EPR. I therefore wish to emphasize what I do and do not say in that
essay and even, with some trepidation, what Bohr did and did not say in his
reply to EPR.
