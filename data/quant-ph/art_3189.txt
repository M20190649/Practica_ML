Comment on `Quantum Games and Quantum Strategies'
In a recent paper, Eisert et al. presented a quantum mechanical
generalization of Prisoner's Dilemma. They asserted that the maximally
entangled game exhibits a unique Nash equilibrium which yields a pay-off
equivalent to cooperative behaviour. In this comment we show that their
observation is incorrect: there is no Nash equilibrium in the space of
deterministic quantum strategies.
