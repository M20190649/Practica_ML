Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment with massive particles as a test
  of relativistic center-of-mass position operator
The nonrelativistic singlet state average $\langle \psi|{\vec a}\cdot\vec
\sigma\otimes {\vec b}\cdot\vec \sigma|\psi\rangle =-\vec a\cdot\vec b $ can be
relativistically generalized if one defines spin {\it via\/} the relativistic
center-of-mass operator. The relativistic correction is quadratic in $v/c$ and
can be measured in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm-type experiments with massive
spin-1/2 particles. A deviation from the nonrelativistic formula would indicate
that for relativistic nonzero-spin particles centers of mass and charge do not
coincide.
