Wave packet dynamics with Bose-Einstein condensates
We study wave packet dynamics of a Bose condensate in a periodically shaken
trap. Dichotomy, that is, dynamic splitting of the condensate, and dynamic
stabilization are analyzed in analogy with similar phenomena in the domain of
atoms in strong laser fields.
