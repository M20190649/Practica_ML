Natural Thermal and Magnetic Entanglement in 1D Heisenberg Model
We investigate the entanglement between any two spins in a one dimensional
Heisenberg chain as a function of temperature and the external magnetic field.
We find that the entanglement in an antiferromagnetic chain can be increased by
increasing the temperature or the external field. Increasing the field can also
create entanglement between otherwise disentangled spins. This entanglement can
be confirmed by testing Bell's inequalities involving any two spins in the
solid.
