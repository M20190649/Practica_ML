A spin-coherent semiconductor photo-detector for quantum communication
We describe how quantum information may be transferred from photon
polarization to electron spin in a semiconductor device. The transfer of
quantum information relies on selection rules for optical transitions, such
that two superposed photon polarizations excite two superposed spin states.
Entanglement of the electron spin state with the spin state of the remaining
hole is prevented by using a single, non-degenerate initial valence band. The
degeneracy of the valence band is lifted by the combination of strain and a
static magnetic field. We give a detailed description of a semiconductor
structure that transfers photon polarization to electron spin coherently, and
allows electron spins to be stored and to be made available for quantum
information processing.
