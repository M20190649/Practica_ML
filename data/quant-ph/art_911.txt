On the Localization of One-Photon States
Single photon states with arbitrarily fast asymptotic power-law fall-off of
energy density and photodetection rate are explicitly constructed. This goes
beyond the recently discovered tenth power-law of the Hellwarth-Nouchi photon
which itself superseded the long-standing seventh power-law of the Amrein
photon.
