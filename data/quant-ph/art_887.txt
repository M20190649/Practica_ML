Schrodinger Equation and Phase Space in Quantum Mechanics
Using classical statistics, Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is
derived from complex space model. Phase-space probability amplitude, that can
be defined on classical point of view, has connections to probability amplitude
in internal space and to wave function in quantum mechanics. In addition, the
physical entity of wave function in quantum mechanics is confirmed once again.
