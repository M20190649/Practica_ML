Quantum mechanical spectral engineering by scaling intertwining
Using the concept of spectral engineering we explore the possibilities of
building potentials with prescribed spectra offered by a modified intertwining
technique involving operators which are the product of a standard first-order
intertwiner and a unitary scaling. In the same context we study the iterations
of such transformations finding that the scaling intertwining provides a
different and richer mechanism in designing quantum spectra with respect to
that given by the standard intertwining
