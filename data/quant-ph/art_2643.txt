Propagation of local decohering action in distributed quantum systems
We study propagation of the decohering influence caused by a local
measurement performed on a distributed quantum system. As an example, the gas
of bosons forming a Bose-Einstein condensate is considered. We demonstrate that
the local decohering perturbation exerted on the measured region propagates
over the system in the form of a decoherence wave, whose dynamics is governed
by elementary excitations of the system. We argue that the post-measurement
evolution of the system (determined by elementary excitations) is of importance
for transfer of decoherence, while the initial collapse of the wave function
has negligible impact on the regions which are not directly affected by the
measurement.
