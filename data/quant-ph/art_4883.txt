Decoherence of geometric phase gates
We consider the effects of certain forms of decoherence applied to both
adiabatic and non-adiabatic geometric phase quantum gates. For a single qubit
we illustrate path-dependent sensitivity to anisotropic noise and for two
qubits we quantify the loss of entanglement as a function of decoherence.
