Relativistic Time of Arrival
We propose a covariant algorithm for relativistic ideal measurements and for
relativistic continuous measurements, its non-relativistic limit results the
algorithm of the Event-Enhanced Quantum Theory. Therefore an additional
intrinsic parameter, the proper time, is used. As an application we compute the
time of arrival of a particle at a detector and find good agreement between the
expected values of the time of arrival for weak detectors and the results of
the relativistic point-mechanic over a wide range. For very high momentums
there is a small probability for a negative time of arrival, so the expected
times are a bit smaller than the results of the relativistic mechanics.
