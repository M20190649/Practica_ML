Charge Renormalization in a New Kind of Non-Local Quantum
  Electrodynamics
The goal of this message is to calculate radiative corrections to the
Sommerfeld fine structure constant in the framework of a new QED in which
particles are described by bilocal fields. The bare constant is 1/136 where 136
is a dimension of the dynamical group of the bihamiltonian system underlying
the suggested elementary particle theory. Our calculations in the second order
of perturbation theory give the renormalized Sommerfeld constant 1/137.0345. We
believe the difference (137.0359 - 137.0345) between corresponding experimental
and theoretical values may be understood as corrections of the fourth order.
