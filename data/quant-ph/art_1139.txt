Prevention of dissipation with two particles
An error prevention procedure based on two-particle encoding is proposed for
protecting an arbitrary unknown quantum state from dissipation, such as phase
damping and amplitude damping. The schemes, which exhibits manifestation of the
quantum Zeno effect, is effective whether quantum bits are decohered
independently or cooperatively. We derive the working condition of the scheme
and argue that this procedure has feasible practical implementation.
