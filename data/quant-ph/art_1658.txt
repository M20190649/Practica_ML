Heisenberg picture approach to the invariants and the exact quantum
  motions for coupled parametric oscillators
For $N$-coupled generalized time-dependent oscillators, primary invariants
and a generalized invariant are found in terms of classical solutions. Exact
quantum motions satisfying the Heisenberg equation of motion are also found.
For number states and coherent states of the generalized invariant, the
uncertainties in positions and momenta are obtained.
