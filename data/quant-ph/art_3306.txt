Quantum Feedback for Protection of Schroedinger-cat states
We review the use of quantum feedback for combatting the decoherence of
Schroedinger-cat-like states in electromagnetic cavities, with special emphasys
on our recent proposal of an automatic mechanism based on the injection of
appropriately prepared ``probe'' and ``feedback'' Rydberg atoms. In the latter
scheme, the information transmission from the probe to the feedback atom is
directly mediated by a second auxiliary cavity. The detection efficiency for
the probe atom is no longer a critical parameter, and the decoherence time of
the linear superposition state can be significantly increased using presently
available technology.
