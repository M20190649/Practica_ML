Quantum cryptography using photon source based on postselection from
  entangled two-photon states
A photon source based on postselection from entangled photon pairs produced
by parametric frequency down-conversion is suggested. Its ability to provide
good approximations of single-photon states is examined. Application of this
source in quantum cryptography for quantum key distribution is discussed.
Advantages of the source compared to other currently used sources are
clarified. Future prospects of the photon source are outlined.
