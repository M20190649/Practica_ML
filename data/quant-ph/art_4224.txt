Effect of noise on geometric logic gates for quantum computation
We introduce the non-adiabatic, or Aharonov-Anandan, geometric phase as a
tool for quantum computation and show how it could be implemented with
superconducting charge qubits. While it may circumvent many of the drawbacks
related to the adiabatic (Berry) version of geometric gates, we show that the
effect of fluctuations of the control parameters on non-adiabatic phase gates
is more severe than for the standard dynamic gates. Similarly, fluctuations
also affect to a greater extent quantum gates that use the Berry phase instead
of the dynamic phase.
