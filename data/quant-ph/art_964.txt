Strong Field Ionization in Arbitrary Laser Polarizations
We present a numerical method for investigating the non-perturbative quantum
mechanical interaction of light with atoms in two dimensions, without a basis
expansion. This enables us to investigate intense laser-atom interactions with
light of arbitrary polarization without approximation. Results are presented
for the dependence of ionization and high harmonic generation on ellipticity
seen in recent experiments. Strong evidence of stabilization in circular
polarization is found.
