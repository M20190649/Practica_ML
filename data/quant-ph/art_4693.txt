Explicit Euler method for solving time dependent Schr≈ëdinger
  equation
Using an explicit Euler substitution it was obtained a system of differential
equations, which can be used to find the solution of time-dependent
1-dimentional Schr\H{o}dinger equation for a general form of the time-dependent
potential.
