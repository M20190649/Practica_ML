Spatially sequential turn-on of spontaneous emission from an atomic wave
  packet
We discuss a simple example demonstrating that spontaneous emission from
"space-time-superposed" atomic center-of-mass wave packets is nontrivially and
time-dependent modified with respect to the standard dipole-pattern typical of
"space-superposed" wave packets. Our approach provides an approximate
description of a nonsimultaneous interaction of electromagnetic field with
different parts of a wave packet.
