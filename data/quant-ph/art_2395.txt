Quantum chaos induced by measurements
We study the dynamics of a "kicked" quantum system undergoing repeated
measurements of momentum. A diffusive behavior is obtained for a large class of
Hamiltonians, even when the dynamics of the classical counterpart is not
chaotic. These results can be interpreted in classical terms by making use of a
"randomized" classical map. We compute the transition probability for the
action variable and consider the semiclassical limit.
