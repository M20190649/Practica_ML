On Multipartite Pure-State Entanglement
We show that pure states of multipartite quantum systems are multiseparable
(i.e. give separable density matrices on tracing any party) if and only if they
have a generalized Schmidt decomposition. Implications of this result for the
quantification of multipartite pure-state entanglement are discussed. Further,
as an application of the techniques used here, we show that any purification of
a bipartite PPT bound entangled state is tri-inseparable, i.e. has none of its
three bipartite partial traces separable.
