Coherent quantum measurement for the direct determination of the degree
  of polarization and Polarization Mode Dispersion compensation
An example of a coherent measurement for the direct evaluation of the degree
of polarization of a single-mode optical beam is presented. It is applied to
the case of great practical importance where depolarization is caused by
polarization mode dispersion. It is demonstrated that coherent measurement has
the potential of significantly increasing the information gain, compared to
standard incoherent measurements.
