More Is Not Necessarily Easier
In this brief comment, we consider the exact, deterministic, and
nonasymptotic transformation of multiple copies of pure states under LOCC. It
was conjectured in quant-ph/0103131 that, if $k$ copies of $|\psi\>$ can be
transformed to $k$ copies of $|\phi\>$, the same holds for all $r \geq k$. We
present counterexamples to the above conjecture.
