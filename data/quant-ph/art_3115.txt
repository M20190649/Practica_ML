Symplectic areas, quantization, and dynamics in electromagnetic fields
A gauge invariant quantization in a closed integral form is developed over a
linear phase space endowed with an inhomogeneous Faraday electromagnetic
tensor. An analog of the Groenewold product formula (corresponding to Weyl
ordering) is obtained via a membrane magnetic area, and extended to the product
of N symbols. The problem of ordering in quantization is related to different
configurations of membranes: a choice of configuration determines a phase
factor that fixes the ordering and controls a symplectic groupoid structure on
the secondary phase space. A gauge invariant solution of the quantum evolution
problem for a charged particle in an electromagnetic field is represented in an
exact continual form and in the semiclassical approximation via the area of
dynamical membranes.
