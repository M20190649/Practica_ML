Indistinguishability and nonlocality in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
  experiment
Quasi-set theory allows us a non trivial relation between
indistinguishability and nonlocality into the context of Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen experiment. Quasi-set theory is a set theory which provides a
manner for dealing with collections of indistinguishable but not identical
elementary particles.
