Entanglement engineering of one-photon wavepackets using a single-atom
  source
We propose a cavity-QED scheme for the controlled generation of sequences of
entangled single-photon wavepackets. A photon is created inside a cavity via an
active medium, such as an atom, and decays into the continuum of radiation
modes outside the cavity(coupled, for example to an optical fiber). Subsequent
wavepackets generated in this way behave as independent logical qubits. This
and the possibility of producing maximally entangled multi-qubit states suggest
many applications in quantum communication.
