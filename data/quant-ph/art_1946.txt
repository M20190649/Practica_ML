The doublet of Dirac fermions in the field of the non-Abelia monopole
  and parity selection rules
The paper concerns a problem of Dirac fermion doublet in the external
monopole potential arisen out of embedding the Abelian monopole solution in the
non-Abe- lian scheme. In this particular case, the Hamiltonian is invariant
under some symmetry operations consisting of an Abelian subgroup in the complex
rotational group SO(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain (A)-freedom in
choosing a discrete operator entering the complete set {H, j^{2}, j_{3}, N(A),
K} . The same complex number A represents a parameter of the wave functions
constructed. The generalized inversion-like operator N(A) implies its own
(A-dependent) de- finition for scalar and pseudoscalar, and further affords
some generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. It is shown that all different
sets of basis func- tions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. In
particular, the functions Psi(A) decompose into linear combinations of
Psi(A=0). However, the bases con- sidered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones
when A is not real number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy
property of the operator N(A) at those A-s.
