Entangled States of N Identical Particles
We explore the connection between quantum entanglement and the exchange
symmetry of the states of N identical particles. Each particle has n-levels.
The N particles span the nN dimensional Hilbert space. We shall call the
general state of the particle as a qunit. The direct product of the N qunit
space is given a decomposition in terms of states with definite permutation
symmetry that are found to have a measure of entanglement which is related to
the representation of the permutation group. The maximally entangled states are
generated from the linear combinations of fully correlated but unentangled
states. The states of lower entanglement are generated from the manifold of
partially correlated states. The degree of exchange symmetry is found to be
related to a group theoretical measure of entanglement.
