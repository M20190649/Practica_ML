Noise, errors and information in quantum amplification
We analyze and compare the characterization of a quantum device in terms of
noise, transmitted bit-error-rate (BER) and mutual information, showing how the
noise description is meaningful only for Gaussian channels. After reviewing the
description of a quantum communication channel, we study the insertion of an
amplifier. We focus attention on the case of direct detection, where the linear
amplifier has a 3 decibels noise figure, which is usually considered an
unsurpassable limit, referred to as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Both
noise and BER could be reduced using an ideal amplifier, which is feasible in
principle. However, just a reduction of noise beyond the SQL does not generally
correspond to an improvement of the BER or of the mutual information. This is
the case of a laser amplifier, where saturation can greatly reduce the noise
figure, although there is no corresponding improvement of the BER. Such
mechanism is illustrated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations.
