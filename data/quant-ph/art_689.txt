Exact Solution Versus Gaussian Approximation for a Non-Ideal Bose Gas in
  One-Dimension
We investigate ground-state and excitation spectrum of a system of
non-relativistic bosons in one-dimension interacting through repulsive,
two-body contact interactions in a self-consistent Gaussian mean-field
approximation. The method consists in writing the variationally determined
density operator as the most general Gaussian functional of the quantized field
operators. There are mainly two advantages in working with one-dimension.
First, the existence of an exact solution for the ground-state and excitation
energies. Second, neither in the perturbative results nor in the Gaussian
approximation itself we do not have to deal with the three-dimensional
patologies of the contact interaction . So that this scheme provides a clear
comparison between these three different results.
