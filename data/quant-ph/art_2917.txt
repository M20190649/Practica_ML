Input-Output Relations in Optical Cavities: a Simple Point of View
In this work we present a very simple approach to input-output relations in
optical cavities, limiting ourselves to one- and two-photon states of the
field.
  After field quantization, we derive the non-unitary transformation between
{\em Inside} and {\em Outside} annihilation and creation operators. Then we
express the most general two-photon state generated by {\em Inside} creation
operators, through base states generated by {\em Outside} creation operators.
After renormalization of coefficients of inside two-photon state, we calculate
the outside photon-number probability distribution in a general case. Finally
we treat with some detail the single mode and symmetrical cavity case.
