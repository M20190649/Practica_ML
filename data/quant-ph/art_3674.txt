"Quantum mysteries for anyone," or classical verities for everyone?
Unarticulated, implicit hypotheses in Bell's analysis of Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen (EPR) correlations are identified and examined. These relate to the
mathematical-analytical properties of random variables, the character of the
relevant sample spaces and physical interpretations. We shown that continuous
hidden variables are not precluded by Bell inequalities. Finally, we propose a
local realistic model of optical EPRB experiments and consider its
implications.
