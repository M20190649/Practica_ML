Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Dynamical Observables, Quantization
  and the Time of Arrival Correspondence Problem
We raise the problem of constructing quantum observables that have classical
counterparts without quantization. Specifically we seek to define and motivate
a solution to the quantum-classical correspondence problem independent from
quantization and discuss the general insufficiency of prescriptive
quantization, particularly the Weyl quantization. We demonstrate our points by
constructing time of arrival operators without quantization and from these
recover their classical counterparts.
