New features in supersymmetry breakdown in quantum mechanics
The supersymmetric quantum mechanical model based on higher-derivative
supercharge operators possessing unbroken supersymmetry and discrete energies
below the vacuum state energy is described. As an example harmonic oscillator
potential is considered.
