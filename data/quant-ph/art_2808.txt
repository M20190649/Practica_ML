SWKB Quantization Rules for Bound States in Quantum Wells
In a recent paper by Gomes and Adhikari (J.Phys B30 5987(1997)) a matrix
formulation of the Bohr-Sommerfield quantization rule has been applied to the
study of bound states in one dimension quantum wells. Here we study these
potentials in the frame work of supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) quantization
approximation and find that SWKB quantization rule is superior to the modified
Bohr-Sommerfield or WKB rules as it exactly reproduces the eigenenergies.
