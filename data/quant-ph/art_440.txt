Comment on ``Creating Metastable Schroedinger Cat States''
After a careful analysis of the feedback model recently proposed by Slosser
and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 418 (1995)], we are led to the conclusion
that---under realistic conditions---their scheme is not significantly more
effective in the production of linear superpositions of macroscopically
distinguishable quantum states than the usual quantum-optical Kerr effect.
