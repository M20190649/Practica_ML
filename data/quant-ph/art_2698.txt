Qutrit Entanglement
We consider the separability of various joint states for N qutrits. We derive
two results: (i) the separability condition for a two-qutrit state that is a
mixture of the maximally mixed state and a maximally entangled state (such a
state is a generalization of the Werner state for two qubits); (ii) upper and
lower bounds on the size of the neighborhood of separable states surrounding
the maximally mixed state for N qutrits.
