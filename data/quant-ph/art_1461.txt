Collectivity, Phase Transitions and Exceptional Points in Open Quantum
  Systems
Phase transitions in open quantum systems, which are associated with the
formation of collective states of a large width and of trapped states with
rather small widths, are related to exceptional points of the Hamiltonian.
Exceptional points are the singularities of the spectrum and eigenfunctions,
when they are considered as functions of a coupling parameter. In the present
paper this parameter is the coupling strength to the continuum. It is shown
that the positions of the exceptional points (their accumulation point in the
thermodynamical limit) depend on the particular type and energy dependence of
the coupling to the continuum in the same way as the transition point of the
corresponding phase transition.
