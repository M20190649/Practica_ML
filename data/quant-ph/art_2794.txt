Rank Two Bipartite Bound Entangled States Do Not Exist
We explore the relation between the rank of a bipartite density matrix and
the existence of bound entanglement. We show a relation between the rank,
marginal ranks, and distillability of a mixed state and use this to prove that
any rank n bound entangled state must have support on no more than an n \times
n Hilbert space. A direct consequence of this result is that there are no
bipartite bound entangled states of rank two. We also show that a separability
condition in terms of a quantum entropy inequality is associated with the above
results. We explore the idea of how many pure states are needed in a mixture to
cancel the distillable entanglement of a Schmidt rank n pure state and provide
a lower bound of n-1. We also prove that a mixture of a non-zero amount of any
pure entangled state with a pure product state is distillable.
