Optimal Measurements of Magnetic Flux in Superconducting Circuits and
  Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics
A model of repeated quantum measurements of magnetic flux in superconducting
circuits manifesting tunneling is discussed. The perturbation due to the
previous measurements of magnetic flux is always present unless quantum
nondemolition measurements are performed. By replacing the classical notion of
noninvasivity with this condition, temporal Bell-like inequalities allows one
to test the observability at the macroscopic level of the conflict between
realism and quantum theory.
