Quantum entanglement in the NMR implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa
  algorithm
A scheme to execute an n-bit Deutsch-Jozsa (D-J) algorithm using n qubits has
been implemented for up to three qubits on an NMR quantum computer. For the one
and two bit Deutsch problem, the qubits do not get entangled, hence the NMR
implementation is achieved without using spin-spin interactions. It is for the
three bit case, that the manipulation of entangled states becomes essential.
The interactions through scalar J-couplings in NMR spin systems have been
exploited to implement entangling transformations required for the three bit
D-J algorithm.
