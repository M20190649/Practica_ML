Realism or Locality: Which Should We Abandon?
We reconsider the consequences of the observed violations of Bell's
inequalities. Two common responses to these violations are: (i) the rejection
of realism and the retention of locality, and (ii) the rejection of locality
and the retention of realism. Here we critique response (i). We argue that
locality contains an implicit form of realism, since in a world view that
embraces locality, spacetime, with its usual, fixed topology, has properties
independent of measurement. Hence we argue that response (i) is incomplete, in
that its rejection of realism is only partial.
