Resonance Offset Tailored Pulses for NMR Quantum Computation
We describe novel composite pulse sequences which act as general rotors and
thus are suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computation. The
Resonance Offset Tailoring To Enhance Nutations (ROTTEN) approach permits
perfect compensation of off-resonance errors at two selected frequencies placed
symmetrically around the frequency of the RF source.
