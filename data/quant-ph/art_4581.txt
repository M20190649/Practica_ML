Covariant quantum measurements may not be optimal
Quantum particles, such as spins, can be used for communicating spatial
directions to observers who share no common coordinate frame. We show that if
the emitter's signals are the orbit of a group, then the optimal detection
method may not be a covariant measurement (contrary to widespread belief). It
may be advantageous for the receiver to use a different group and an indirect
estimation method: first, an ordinary measurement supplies redundant numerical
parameters; the latter are then used for a nonlinear optimal identification of
the signal.
