Spontaneous decay of an excited atom in an absorbing dielectric
Starting from the quantized version of Maxwell's equations for the
electromagnetic field in an arbitrary linear Kramers-Kronig dielectric,
spontaneous decay of the excited state of a two-level atom embedded in a
dispersive and absorbing medium is studied and the decay rate is calculated.
The calculations are performed for both the (Clausius-Mosotti) virtual cavity
model and the (Glauber-Lewenstein) real cavity model. It is shown that owing to
nonradiative decay associated with absorption the rate of spontaneous decay
sensitively depends on the cavity radius when the atomic transition frequency
approaches an absorption band of the medium. Only when the effect of absorption
is fully disregarded, then the familiar local-field correction factors are
recovered.
