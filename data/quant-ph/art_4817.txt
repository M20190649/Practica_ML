Robustness of Multi-Party Entanglement
How common is large-scale entanglement in nature? As a first step towards
addressing this question, we study the robustness of multi-party entanglement
under local decoherence, modeled by partially depolarizing channels acting
independently on each subsystem. Surprisingly, we find that n-qubit GHZ
entanglement can stand more than 55 % local depolarization in the limit of n
going to infinity, and that GHZ states are more robust than other generic
states of 3 and 4 qubits. We also study spin-squeezed states in the limit n
going to infinity and find that they too can stand considerable local
depolarization.
