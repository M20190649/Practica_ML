Dynamic Rules for Decoherence
In orthodox quantum theory, decoherence is presumed to be caused by
observation. In this paper, the idea of replacing observation, as the cause of
decoherence, with rules derived from the dynamics of the system is addressed.
Such rules determine the timing of decoherence and the states in the mixture
afterward. For instance, energy conservation during decohenence, for each
possible transition, leads to a timing rule. Exponetial decay and ergodic
behavior follow directly from the dynamic rules as do Boltzman's postulate of
equally probable micro-states and the Pauli rate equations. Ergodic behavior in
mesoscopic systems is predicted and those preditions are strikingly similar to
behavior observed in at least two laboratories.
