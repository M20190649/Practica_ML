Geometric Phase of Three-level Systems in Interferometry
We present the first scheme for producing and measuring an Abelian geometric
phase shift in a three-level system where states are invariant under a
non-Abelian group. In contrast to existing experiments and proposals for
experiments, based on U(1)-invariant states, our scheme geodesically evolves
U(2)-invariant states in a four-dimensional SU(3)/U(2) space and is physically
realized via a three-channel optical interferometer.
