Operationally Invariant Information in Quantum Measurements
A new measure of information in quantum mechanics is proposed which takes
into account that for quantum systems the only feature known before an
experiment is performed are the probabilities for various events to occur. The
sum of the individual measures of information for mutually complementary
observations is invariant under the choice of the particular set of
complementary observations and conserved if there is no information exchange
with an environment. That operational quantum information invariant results in
N bits of information for a system consisting of N qubits.
