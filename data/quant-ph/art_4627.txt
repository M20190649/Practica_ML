Towards a quantum Hall effect for atoms using electric fields
An atomic analogue of Landau quantization based on the Aharonov-Casher (AC)
interaction is developed. The effect provides a first step towards an atomic
quantum Hall system using electric fields, which may be realized in a
Bose-Einstein condensate.
