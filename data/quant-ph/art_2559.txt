Quantum simulation of a three-body interaction Hamiltonian on an NMR
  quantum computer
Extensions of average Hamiltonian theory to quantum computation permit the
design of arbitrary Hamiltonians, allowing rotations throughout a large Hilbert
space. In this way, the kinematics and dynamics of any quantum system may be
simulated by a quantum computer. A basis mapping between the systems dictates
the average Hamiltonian in the quantum computer needed to implement the desired
Hamiltonian in the simulated system. The flexibility of the procedure is
illustrated with NMR on 13-C labelled Alanine by creating the non-physical
Hamiltonian ZZZ corresponding to a three body interaction.
