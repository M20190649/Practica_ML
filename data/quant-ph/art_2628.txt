Solid-state NMR quantum computer with individual access to qubits and
  some its ensemble developments
Here we made an analysis of the principles of a semiconductor NMR quantum
computer and its developments. The known variant of an individual-access
computer (B. Kane) and alternative solid-state bulk-ensemble approach versions
allowing to avoid some difficulties in implementing the first variant are
considered.
