Dynamical suppression of decoherence in two-state quantum systems
The dynamics of a decohering two-level system driven by a suitable control
Hamiltonian is studied. The control procedure is implemented as a sequence of
radiofrequency pulses that repetitively flip the state of the system, a
technique that can be termed quantum "bang-bang" control after its classical
analog. Decoherence introduced by the system's interaction with a quantum
environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous
flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is
made comparable to the correlation time of the environment. The model suggests
a strategy to fight against decoherence that complements existing quantum
error-correction techniques.
