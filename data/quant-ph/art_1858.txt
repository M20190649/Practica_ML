NMR Quantum Computation with a hyperpolarized nuclear spin bulk
We consider two new quantum gate mechanisms based on nuclear spins in
hyperpolarized solid $^{129}Xe$ and HCl mixtures and inorganic semiconductors.
We propose two schemes for implementing a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate based on
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) from hyperpolarized solid $^{129}Xe$ and HCl mixtures and optically
pumped NMR in semiconductors. Such gates might be built up with particular
spins addressable based on MRI techniques and optical pumping and optical
detection techniques. The schemes could be useful for implementing actual
quantum computers in terms of a cellular automata architecture.
