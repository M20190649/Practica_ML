q-deformed dynamics and Josephson junction
We define a generalized rate equation for an observable in quantum mechanics,
that involves a parameter q and whose limit $q\to 1$ gives the standard
Heisenberg equation. The generalized rate equation is used to study dynamics of
current biased Josephson junction. It is observed that this toy model
incorporates diffraction like effects in the critical current. Physical
interpretation for q is provided which is also shown to be q-deformation
parameter.
