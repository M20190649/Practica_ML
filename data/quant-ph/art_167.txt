Penning trap and vacuum noise
A number of comments are provided on Rogers's model experiment to measure the
circular Unruh vacuum noise by means of a hyperbolic Penning trap inside a
microwave cavity. It is suggested that cylindrical Penning traps, being
geometrically simpler, and controlled almost at the same level of accuracy as
the hyperbolic trap, might be a better choice for such an experiment. Besides,
the microwave modes of the trap itself, of known analytical structure, can be
directly used in trying to obtain measurable results for such a tiny noise
effect.
