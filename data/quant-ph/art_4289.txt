A (Classical) Representation for a Spin-S Entity as a compound system in
  R^3 consisting of 2S Individual Spin-1/2 Entities
We generalize the results of [B. Coecke, Helv. Phys. Acta 68, 396 (1995)] for
the representation of coherent states of a spin-1 entity to spin-S entities
with S>1 and to non-coherent spin states: through the introduction of 'hidden
correlations' (see quant-ph/0105093) we introduce a representation for a spin-S
entity as a compound system consisting of 2S 'individual' spin-1/2 entities,
each of them represented by a 'proper state', and such that we are able to
consider a measurement on the spin-S entity as a measurement on each of the
individual spin-1/2 entities. If the spin-S entity is in a maximal spin state,
the 2S individual spin-1/2 entities behave as a collection of indistinguishable
but separated entities. If not so, we have to introduce the same kind of hidden
correlations as required for a hidden correlation representation of a compound
quantum systems described by a symmetrical superposition. Moreover, by applying
the Majorana representation and Aerts' representation for a spin-1/2 entity,
this hidden correlation representation yields a classical mechanistic
representation of a spin-S entity in R^3.
