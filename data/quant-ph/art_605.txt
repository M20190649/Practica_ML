Information-entropy and the space of decoherence functions in
  generalised quantum theory
In standard quantum theory, the ideas of information-entropy and of pure
states are closely linked. States are represented by density matrices $\rho$ on
a Hilbert space and the information-entropy $-tr(\rho\log\rho)$ is minimised on
pure states (pure states are the vertices of the boundary of the convex set of
states). The space of decoherence functions in the consistent histories
approach to generalised quantum theory is also a convex set. However, by
showing that every decoherence function can be written as a convex combination
of two other decoherence functions we demonstrate that there are no `pure'
decoherence functions.
  The main content of the paper is a new notion of information-entropy in
generalised quantum mechanics which is applicable in contexts in which there is
no a priori notion of time. Information-entropy is defined first on consistent
sets and then we show that it decreases upon refinement of the consistent set.
This information-entropy suggests an intrinsic way of giving a consistent set
selection criterion.
