Conclusive tests of local realism and pseudoscalar mesons
Many beautiful experiments have been addressed to test standard quantum
mechanics against local realistic models. Even if a strong evidence favouring
standard quantum mechanics is emerged, a conclusive experiment is still
lacking, because of low detection efficiencies. Recently, experiments based on
pseudoscalar mesons have been proposed as a way for obtaining a conclusive
experiment. In this paper, we investigate if this result can effectively be
obtained. Our conclusions, based on a careful analysis of the proposed set ups,
are that this will not be possible due to intrinsic limitations of these kind
of experiments.
