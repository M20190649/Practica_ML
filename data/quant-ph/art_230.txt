Polynomial Lie Algebras $sl_{pd}(2)$ in Action: Smooth $sl(2)$ Mappings
  and Approximations
We examine applications of polynomial Lie algebras $sl_{pd}(2)$ to solve
physical tasks in $G_{inv}$-invariant models of coupled subsystems in quantum
physics. A general operator formalism is given to solve spectral problems using
expansions of generalized coherent states, eigenfunctions and other physically
important quantities by power series in the $sl_{pd}(2)$ coset generators
$V_{\pm}$. We also discuss some mappings and approximations related to the
familiar $sl(2)$ algebra formalism. On this way a new closed analytical
expression is found for energy spectra which coincides with exact solutions in
certain cases and, in general, manifests an availability of incommensurable
eigenfrequencies related to a nearly chaotic dynamics of systems under study.
