Mathematical Techniques for Quantum Communication Theory
We present mathematical techniques for addressing two closely related
questions in quantum communication theory. In particular, we give a
statistically motivated derivation of the Bures-Uhlmann measure of
distinguishability for density operators, and we present a simplified proof of
the Holevo upper bound to the mutual information of quantum communication
channels. Both derivations give rise to novel quantum measurements.
