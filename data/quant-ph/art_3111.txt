Entanglement measures and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance
In order to construct a measure of entanglement on the basis of a
``distance'' between two states, it is one of desirable properties that the
``distance'' is nonincreasing under every completely positive trace preserving
map. Contrary to a recent claim, this letter shows that the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance does not have this property.
