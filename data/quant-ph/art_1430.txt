Hamiltonian Formalism in Quantum Mechanics
Heisenberg motion equations in Quantum mechanics can be put into the Hamilton
form. The difference between the commutator and its principal part, the Poisson
bracket, can be accounted for exactly. Canonical transformations in Quantum
mechanics are not, or at least not what they appear to be; their properties are
formulated in a series of Conjectures.
