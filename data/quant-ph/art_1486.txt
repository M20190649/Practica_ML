Quantum Logic Gates and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Pulse Sequences
We demonstrate how NMR can in principle be used to implement all the elements
required to build quantum computers, and briefly discuss the potential
applications of insights from quantum logic to the development of novel pulse
sequences with applications in more conventional NMR experiments.
