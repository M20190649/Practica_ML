Quantum mechanical histories and the Berry phase
We elaborate on the distinction between geometric and dynamical phase in
quantum theory and show that the former is intrinsically linked to the quantum
mechanical probabilistic structure. In particular, we examine the appearance of
the Berry phase in the consistent histories scheme and establish that it is the
basic building block of the decoherence functional.
  These results are consequences of the novel temporal structure of
histories-based theories.
