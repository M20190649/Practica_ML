Quantum versus Classical Learnability
We consider quantum versions of two well-studied classical learning models:
Angluin's model of exact learning from membership queries and Valiant's
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model of learning from random examples. We
give positive and negative results for quantum versus classical learnability.
For each of the two learning models described above, we show that any concept
class is information-theoretically learnable from polynomially many quantum
examples if and only if it is information-theoretically learnable from
polynomially many classical examples. In contrast to this information-theoretic
equivalence betwen quantum and classical learnability, though, we observe that
a separation does exist between efficient quantum and classical learnability.
For both the model of exact learning from membership queries and the PAC model,
we show that under a widely held computational hardness assumption for
classical computation (the intractability of factoring), there is a concept
class which is polynomial-time learnable in the quantum version but not in the
classical version of the model.
