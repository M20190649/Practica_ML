Realization of nonlinear oscillators with a trapped ion
We consider a trapped ion with a quantized center-of-mass motion in 2D trap
potential. With external laser fields the effective (non)linear coupling of two
orthogonal vibrational modes can be established via stimulated Raman
transition. Nonclassical vibrational states such as squeezed states or two-mode
entangled states (Schroedinger cat-like states) can be generated. When the
vibrational modes are entangled with internal energy levels the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be prepared.
