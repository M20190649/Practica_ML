Quantum interfaces
Rational agents acting as observers use ``knowables'' to construct a vision
of the outside world. Thereby, they are bound by the information exchanged with
what they consider to be objects. The cartesian cut or, in modern terminology,
the interface mediating this exchange, is again a construction. It serves as a
``scaffolding,'' an intermediate construction capable of providing the
necessary conceptual means. An attempt is made to formalize the interface, in
particular the quantum interface and quantum measurements, by a symbolic
information exchange. A principle of conservation of information is reviewed
and a measure of information flux through the interface is proposed.
