Reconstructing the density operator by using generalized field
  quadratures
The Wigner function for one and two-mode quantum systems is explicitely
expressed in terms of the marginal distribution for the generic linearly
transformed quadratures. Then, also the density operator of those systems is
written in terms of the marginal distribution of these quadratures. Some
examples to apply this formalism, and a reduction to the usual optical homodyne
tomography are considered.
