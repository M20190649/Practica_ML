Valuations on Functionally Closed Sets of Quantum Mechanical Observables
  and Von Neumann's 'No-Hidden-Variables' Theorem
We apply the machinery of projection lattices and von Neumann algebras to
analyze the question of how modal interpretations can (and do) circumvent von
Neumann's infamous 'no-hidden-variables' theorem.
