Experimental violation of a spin-1 Bell inequality using
  maximally-entangled four-photon states
We demonstrate the first experimental violation of a spin-1 Bell inequality.
The spin-1 inequality is a calculation based on the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and
Holt formalism. For entangled spin-1 particles the maximum quantum mechanical
prediction is 2.552 as opposed to a maximum of 2, predicted using local hidden
variables. We obtained an experimental value of 2.27 $\pm 0.02$ using the
four-photon state generated by pulsed, type-II, stimulated parametric
down-conversion. This is a violation of the spin-1 Bell inequality by more than
13 standard deviations.
