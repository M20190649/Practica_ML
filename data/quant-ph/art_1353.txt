Parametric up conversion of the vacuum
The theory of parametric down conversion of the vacuum, based on a real
zeropoint, or "vacuum" electromagnetic field, has been treated in earlier
articles. The same theory predicts a hitherto unsuspected phenomenon -
parametric up conversion of the vacuum. This article describes how the
phenomenon may be demonstrated experimentally.
