Many Time Interpretation Of the Quantum Measurement Process
Many Time Interpretation (MTI) proposes that each stochastic "quantum jump"
("reduction") concerning each single object (of an ensemble) represents a
consequence of a (stochastic) choice (change) of Time. Therefore, each single
object experiences its own (local), stochastically chosen Time, which is as
real for it, as the macroscopic Time is real in classical physics. Therefore,
instead of the "indeterminism" with regard to the macroscopic Time, MTI
proposes "determinism", but with regard to the set(s) of (stochastically
chosen) local Times. Within an axiomatization, which includes the composite
system "single object+apparatus+environment, MTI leads to : (i) Recognizing the
amplification process as the fundamental "part" of the measurement process,
(ii) Nonvalidity of the Schrodinger equation concerning the "whole", O+A+E,
which makes the "state reduction process" unnecessary and unphysical, (iii)
Natural deducibility of the macroscopic irreversibility, and (iv)
Nonequivalence of MTI with any existing measurement theory, or interpretation.
Thus, within MTI, the measurement problem reduces basically onto the search for
quantum effect, which would allow forthe local, stochastic change of Time.
