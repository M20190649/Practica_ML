Scheme for the preparation of the multi-particle entanglement in cavity
  QED
Here we present a quantum electrodynamics (QED) model involving a
large-detuned single-mode cavity field and $n$ identical two-level atoms. One
of its applications for the preparation of the multi-particle states is
analyzed. In addition to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, the W
class states can also be generated in this scheme. The further analysis for the
experiment of the model of $n=2$ case is also presented by considering the
possible three-atom collision.
