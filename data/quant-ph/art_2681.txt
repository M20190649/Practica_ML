An optically driven quantum dot quantum computer
We propose a quantum computer structure based on coupled asymmetric
single-electron quantum dots. Adjacent dots are strongly coupled by means of
electric dipole-dipole interactions enabling rapid computation rates. Further,
the asymmetric structures can be tailored for a long coherence time. The result
maximizes the number of computation cycles prior to loss of coherence.
