A Quantum Approach To Static Games Of Complete Information
We extend the concept of a classical two-person static game to the quantum
domain, by giving an Hilbert structure to the space of classical strategies and
studying the Battle of the Sexes game. We show that the introduction of
entangled strategies leads to a unique solution of this game.
