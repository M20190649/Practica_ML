A Solution to the Quantum Measurement Problem
A new formulation of quantum mechanics is developed which does not require
the concept of the wave-particle duality. Rather than assigning probabilities
to outcomes, probabilities are instead assigned to entire fine-grained
histories. The formulation is fully relativistic and applicable to
multi-particle systems. It shall be shown that this new formulation makes the
same experimental predictions as quantum field theory, but without having to
rely upon the notion of a system evolving in a superposition of quantum states
until collapsed by an observation. It is thus free from the problem of deciding
what exactly constitutes an observation (the measurement problem) and may
therefore be applied just as readily to the macroscopic world as to the
microscopic.
