The quantum cryptography and the unambiguous measurement of quantum
  nonorthogonal states
We discuss the unambiguous measurement of quantum nonorthogonal states in
connection with the quantum cryptography. We show that checking a ratio of null
one to signal is essential in detecting a certain kind of eavesdropping in the
case of two nonorthogonal states quantum cryptography. We prove that it is not
needed in the case of the four states quantum cryptography.
