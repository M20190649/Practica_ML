Tomographic measurement of nonclassical radiation states
We propose to experimentally test the nonclassicality of quantum states
through homodyne tomography. For single-mode states we check violations of
inequalities involving the photon-number probability. For two-mode states we
test the nonclassicality by reconstructing some suitable number-operator
functions. The test can be performed with available quantum efficiency of
homodyne detection, by measuring the pertaining quantities on the corresponding
noisy states.
