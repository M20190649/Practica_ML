State Vector Collapse Probabilities and Separability of Independent
  Systems in Hughston's Stochastic Extension of the Schr√∂dinger Equation
We give a general proof that Hughston's stochastic extension of the
Schr\"odinger equation leads to state vector collapse to energy eigenstates,
with collapse probabilities given by the quantum mechanical probabilities
computed from the initial state. We also show that for a system composed of
independent subsystems, Hughston's equation separates into similar independent
equations for the each of the subsystems, correlated only through the common
Wiener process that drives the state reduction.
