Interaction time of a wave packet interact with a potential barrier
We study the evolution of a wave packet impinging onto a one dimensional
potential barrier. The transmission and reflection times discussed in the
literature for stationary states do not correspond to the times required for
the emergence of a transmitted or a reflected packet. We propose new
definitions for the interaction (dwell) time and the transmission and
reflection times which are suitable for packets and fit better the actual time
evolution of the packet.
