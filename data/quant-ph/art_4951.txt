Schroedinger discovery of wave mechanics
Schroedinger's great discovery of wave mechanics in 1926 - his annus
mirabilis - is discussed in detail. Beside the six most important papers that
appeared during the first half of 1926, letters between Schroedinger and
leading physicists at this time are main sources of this account.
