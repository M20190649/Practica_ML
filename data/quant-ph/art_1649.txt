Quantum synthesis of 3D vibrational states of trapped ions
A universal algorithm for a deterministic preparation of arbitrary
three--mode bosonic states is introduced. In particular, we consider
preparation of entangled quantum states of a vibrational motion of an ion
confined in a 3D trapping potential. The target states are established after a
proper sequence of laser stimulated Raman transitions. Stability of the
algorithm with respect to a technical noise is discussed and the distance
(fidelity) of outputs with respect to target states is studied.
