Simple Proof of Security of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
We prove the security of the 1984 protocol of Bennett and Brassard (BB84) for
quantum key distribution. We first give a key distribution protocol based on
entanglement purification, which can be proven secure using methods from Lo and
Chau's proof of security for a similar protocol. We then show that the security
of this protocol implies the security of BB84. The entanglement-purification
based protocol uses Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, and properties of these
codes are used to remove the use of quantum computation from the Lo-Chau
protocol.
