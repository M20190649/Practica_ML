Some Observable Results of the Retarded Bohm's Theory
It is shown that the retarded Bohm's theory has at least four novel
properties. (1) The center of mass of an isolated two-body system is
accelerated. (2) Hydrogen-like atoms are unstable. (3) The distribution
function differs from the standard one. (4) The definition of energy needs some
care.
