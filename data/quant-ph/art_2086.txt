State estimation for large ensembles
We consider the problem of estimating the state of a large but finite number
$N$ of identical quantum systems. In the limit of large $N$ the problem
simplifies. In particular the only relevant measure of the quality of the
estimation is the mean quadratic error matrix. Here we present a bound on the
mean quadratic error which is a new quantum version of the Cram\'er-Rao
inequality. This new bound expresses in a succinct way how in the quantum case
one can trade information about one parameter for information about another
parameter. The bound holds for arbitrary measurements on pure states, but only
for separable measurements on mixed states--a striking example of non-locality
without entanglement for mixed but not for pure states. Cram\'er-Rao bounds are
generally derived under the assumption that the estimator is unbiased. We also
prove that under additional regularity conditions our bound also holds for
biased estimators. Finally we prove that when the unknown states belong to a 2
dimensional Hilbert space our quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound can always be attained
and we provide an explicit measurement strategy that attains our bound. This
therefore provides a complete solution to the problem of estimating as
efficiently as possible the unknown state of a large ensemble of qubits in the
same pure state. For qubits in the same mixed state, this also provides an
optimal estimation strategy if one only considers separable measurements.
