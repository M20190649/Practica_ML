Unpolarized light in quantum optics
We present a new derivation of the unpolarized quantum states of light, whose
general form was first derived by Prakash and Chandra [Phys. Rev. A 4, 796
(1971)]. Our derivation makes use of some basic group theory, is
straightforward, and offers some new insights.
