Quantum correlations are not local elements of reality
I show a situation of multiparticle entanglement which cannot be explained in
the framework of an interpretation of quantum mechanics recently proposed by
Mermin. This interpretation is based on the assumption that correlations
between subsystems of an individual isolated composed quantum system are real
objective local properties of that system.
