Endoscopic Tomography and Quantum-Non-Demolition
We propose to measure the quantum state of a single mode of the radiation
field in a cavity---the signal field---by coupling it via a
quantum-non-demolition Hamiltonian to a meter field in a highly squeezed state.
We show that quantum state tomography on the meter field using balanced
homodyne detection provides full information about the signal state. We discuss
the influence of measurement of the meter on the signal field.
