An atom optics experiment to investigate faster-than-light tunneling
We describe a series of atom optics experiments underway at Toronto for
investigating tunnelling interaction times of various sorts. We begin by
discussing some outstanding issues and confusions related to the question of
whether or not superluminal tunnelling can be construed as true
faster-than-light ``signal propagation,'' a question which we answer in the
negative. We then argue that atom optics is an arena ideally suited for
addressing a variety of remaining questions about how, where, and for how long
a particle interacts with a tunnel barrier. We present recent results on a
modified ``delta-kick cooling'' scheme which we have used to prepare Rubidium
atoms with one-dimensional de Broglie wavelengths on the order of an optical
wavelength, along with simulations showing that from these temperatures, we
will be able to use acousto-optically modulated dipole-force barriers to
velocity-select ultracold atom samples ideal for future tunnelling experiments.
