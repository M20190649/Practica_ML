Coding Theorems for Quantum Channels
The more than thirty years old issue of the (classical) information capacity
of quantum communication channels was dramatically clarified during the last
years, when a number of direct quantum coding theorems was discovered. The
present paper gives a self contained treatment of the subject, following as
much in parallel as possible with classical information theory and, on the
other side, stressing profound differences of the quantum case. An emphasis is
made on recent results, such as general quantum coding theorems including cases
of infinite (possibly continuous) alphabets and constrained inputs, reliability
function for pure state channels and quantum Gaussian channel. Several still
unsolved problems are briefly outlined.
