Factorization, ladder operators and isospectral structures
Using the modified factorization method employed by Mielnik for the harmonic
oscillator, we show that isospectral structures associated with a second order
operator $H$, can always be constructed whenever $H$ could be factored, or
exist ladder operators for its eigenfunctions. Three examples are shown, and
properties like completeness and integrability are discused for the general
case.
