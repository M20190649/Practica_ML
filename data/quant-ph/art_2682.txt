Counting Marbles with 'Accessible' Mass Density: A Reply to Bassi and
  Ghirardi
In a previous article (cf. quant-ph/9905065) we argued that, while Lewis is
correct that the enumeration principle fails in dynamical wavepacket reduction
theories, one need not following Lewis in rejecting these theories. Because the
dynamical reduction process itself prevents the failure of enumeration from
ever becoming manifest, and because one can treat the semantics for dynamical
reduction theories as not adding anything of ontological import to them, it is
reasonable to accept these theories notwithstanding Lewis's counting anomaly.
In their response to our paper (cf. quant-ph/9907050), Bassi and Ghirardi
reject our criticisms of their own response to Lewis, as well as our argument
against Lewis that dynamical reduction precludes failures of enumeration from
ever becoming manifest. Our intention here is to demonstrate that Bassi and
Ghirardi's responses to us do not succeed.
