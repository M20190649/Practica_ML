Quantum Erasure by Transverse Indistinguishability
We show that the first experiment with double-slits and twin photons detected
in coincidence can be understood as a quantum eraser. The ``which path''
information is erased by transverse indistinguishability obtained by means of
mode filtering in the twin conjugated beam. A delayed choice quantum eraser
based on the same scheme is proposed.
