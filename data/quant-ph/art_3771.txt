Dynamical Revivals in Fermi Accelerator Model
We investigate quantum revivals in the dynamics of an atom in an atomic Fermi
accelerator. It is demonstrated that the external driving field influences the
revival time significantly. Analytical expressions are presented which are
based on semiclassical secular theory. These analytical results explain the
dependence of the revival time on the characteristic parameters of the problem
quantitatively in a simple way. They are in excellent agreement with numerical
results.
