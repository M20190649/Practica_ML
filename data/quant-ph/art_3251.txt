Transverse Isotropy in Identical Particle Scattering
It is pointed out that the cross section for the scattering of identical
charged bosons is isotropic over a broad angular range around 90 degrees when
the Sommerfeld parameter has a critical value, which depends exclusively on the
spin of the particle. A discussion of systems where this phenomenon can be
observed is presented.
