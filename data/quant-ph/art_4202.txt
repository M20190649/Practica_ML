Generation and manipulation of squeezed states of light in optical
  networks for quantum communication and computation
We analyze a fiber-optic component which could find multiple uses in novel
information-processing systems utilizing squeezed states of light. Our approach
is based on the phenomenon of photon-number squeezing of soliton noise after
the soliton has propagated through a nonlinear optical fiber. Applications of
this component in optical networks for quantum computation and quantum
cryptography are discussed.
