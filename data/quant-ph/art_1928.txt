Decoherence and fidelity in ion traps with fluctuating trap parameters
We consider two different kinds of fluctuations in an ion trap potential:
external fluctuating electrical fields, which cause statistical movement
(``wobbling'') of the ion relative to the center of the trap, and fluctuations
of the spring constant, which are due to fluctuations of the ac-component of
the potential applied in the Paul trap for ions. We write down master equations
for both cases and, averaging out the noise, obtain expressions for the heating
of the ion. We compare our results to previous results for far-off resonance
optical traps and heating in ion traps. The effect of fluctuating external
electrical fields for a quantum gate operation (controlled-NOT) is determined
and the fidelity for that operation derived.
