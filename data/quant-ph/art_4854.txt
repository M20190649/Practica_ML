Maximum entanglement of quantum-dot systems with single excitation in
  the spin van der Waals model
Time evolution of entanglement of N quantum dots is analyzed within the
spin-1/2 van der Waals (or Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick) XY model. It is shown that,
for a single dot initially excited and disentangled from the remaining
unexcited dots, the maximum bipartite entanglement can be obtained in the
systems of N=2,...,6 dots only.
