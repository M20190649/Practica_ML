Quantum statistical properties of the radiation field in a cavity with a
  movable mirror
A quantum system composed of a cavity radiation field interacting with a
movable mirror is considered and quantum statistical properties of the field
are studied. Such a system can serve in principle as an idealized meter for
detection of a weak classical force coupled to the mirror which is modelled by
a quantum harmonic oscillator. It is shown that the standard quantum limit on
the measurement of the mirror position arises naturally from the properties of
the system during its dynamical evolution. However, the force detection
sensitivity of the system falls short of the corresponding standard quantum
limit. We also study the effect of the nonlinear interaction between the moving
mirror and the radiation pressure on the quadrature fluctuations of the
initially coherent cavity field.
