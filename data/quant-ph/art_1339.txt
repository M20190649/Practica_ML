Bose--Einstein solitons in highly asymmetric traps
We obtain analytic solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with negative
scattering length in highly asymmetric traps. We find that in these traps the
Bose--Einstein condensates behave like quasiparticles and do not expand when
the trapping in one direction is eliminated. The results can be applicable to
the control of the motion of Bose--Einstein condensates.
