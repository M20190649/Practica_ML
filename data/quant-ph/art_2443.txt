Disentangling Nonlocality and Teleportation
Quantum entanglement can be used to demonstrate nonlocality and to teleport a
quantum state from one place to another. The fact that entanglement can be used
to do both these things has led people to believe that teleportation is a
nonlocal effect. In this paper it is shown that teleportation is conceptually
independent of nonlocality. This is done by constructing a toy local theory in
which cloning is not possible (without a no-cloning theory teleportation makes
limited sense) but teleportation is. Teleportation in this local theory is
achieved in an analogous way to the way it is done with quantum theory. This
work provides some insight into what type of process teleportation is.
