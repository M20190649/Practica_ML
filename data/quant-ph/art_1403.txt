Quantum mutual entropy for Jaynes-Cummings model
The dynamics of an atom on the Jaynes-Cummings model has been studied by an
atomic inversion, von Neumann entropy and so on. In this letter, we will treat
the Jaynes-Cummings model as a problem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
and apply quantum mutual entropy to study the irreversible dynamics of a state
for the atom on this model.
