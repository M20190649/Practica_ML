Generally relativistical Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko formalism and
  behaviour of quantum-mechanical particles of spin 1/2 in the Abelian monopole
  field
Some attention in the literature has been given to the case of a particle of
spin 1/2 on the background of the external monopole potential. Some aspects of
this problem are reexamined here. The primary technical novelty is that the
tetrad generally relativistic method of Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko for
describing a spinor particle is exploited. The choice of the formalism has
turned out to be of great fruitfulness for examining the system. It is matter
that, as known, the use of a special spherical tetrad in the theory of a spin
1/2 particle had led Schrodinger to a basis of remarkable features. The basis
has been used with great efficiency by Pauli in his investigation on the pro-
blem of allowed spherically symmetric wave functions in quantum mechanics. For
our purposes, just several simple rules extracted from the much more com-
prehensive Pauli's analysis will be quite sufficient; those are almost mnemo-
nic working regulations. So, one may remember some very primary facts of D-
functions theory and then produce automatically proper wave functions. It seems
rather likely, that there may exist a generalized analog of such a re-
presentation for J(i)-operators, that might be successfully used whenever in a
linear problem there exists a spherical symmetry, irrespective of the con-
crete embodiment of such a symmetry. In particular, the case of electron in the
external Abelian monopole field completely come under the Sch-Pau method.
