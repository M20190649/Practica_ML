Entanglement degradation in continuous-variable quantum teleportation
The influence of losses in the transmission of continuous-variable entangled
light through linear devices such as optical fibers is studied, with special
emphasis on Gaussian states. Upper bounds on entanglement and the distance to
the set of separable Gaussian states are calculated. Compared with the distance
measure, the bounds can substantially overestimate the entanglement and thus do
not show the drastic decrease of entanglement with increasing mean photon
number, as does the distance measure. In particular, it shows that losses give
rise to entanglement saturation, which principally limits the amount of
information that can be transferred quantum mechanically in continuous-variable
teleportation. Even for an initially infinitely squeezed two-mode squeezed
vacuum, high-fidelity teleportation is only possible over distances that are
much smaller than the absorption lengths.
