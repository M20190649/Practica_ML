Wigner-function description of quantum teleportation in arbitrary
  dimensions and continuous limit
We present a unified approach to quantum teleportation in arbitrary
dimensions based on the Wigner-function formalism. This approach provides us
with a clear picture of all manipulations performed in the teleportation
protocol. In addition within the framework of the Wigner-function formalism all
the imperfections of the manipulations can be easily taken into account.
