Energy-Sensitive and "Classical-like" Distances Between Quantum States
We introduce the concept of the ``polarized'' distance, which distinguishes
the orthogonal states with different energies. We also give new inequalities
for the known Hilbert-Schmidt distance between neighbouring states and express
this distance in terms of the quasiprobability distributions and the normally
ordered moments. Besides, we discuss the distance problem in the framework of
the recently proposed ``classical-like'' formulation of quantum mechanics,
based on the symplectic tomography scheme. The examples of the Fock, coherent,
``Schroedinger cats,'' squeezed, phase, and thermal states are considered.
