Dynamics as Shadow of Phase Space Geometry
Starting with the generally well accepted opinion that quantizing an
arbitrary Hamiltonian system involves picking out some additional structure on
the classical phase space (the {\sl shadow} of quantum mechanics in the
classical theory), we describe classical as well as quantum dynamics as a
purely geometrical effect by introducing a {\sl phase space metric structure}.
This produces an ${\cal O}(\hbar)$ modification of the classical equations of
motion reducing at the same time the quantization of an arbitrary Hamiltonian
system to standard procedures. Our analysis is carried out in analogy with the
adiabatic motion of a charged particle in a curved background (the additional
metric structure) under the influence of a universal magnetic field (the
classical symplectic structure). This allows one to picture dynamics in an
unusual way, and reveals a dynamical mechanism that produces the selection of
the right set of physical quantum states.
