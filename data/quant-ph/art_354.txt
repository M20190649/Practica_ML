Quantum Error Correction and Orthogonal Geometry
A group theoretic framework is introduced that simplifies the description of
known quantum error-correcting codes and greatly facilitates the construction
of new examples. Codes are given which map 3 qubits to 8 qubits correcting 1
error, 4 to 10 qubits correcting 1 error, 1 to 13 qubits correcting 2 errors,
and 1 to 29 qubits correcting 5 errors.
