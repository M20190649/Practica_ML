Levinson's theorem for the Schr√∂dinger equation in two dimensions
Levinson's theorem for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a cylindrically
symmetric potential in two dimensions is re-established by the Sturm-Liouville
theorem. The critical case, where the Schr\"{o}dinger equation has a finite
zero-energy solution, is analyzed in detail. It is shown that, in comparison
with Levinson's theorem in non-critical case, the half bound state for $P$
wave, in which the wave function for the zero-energy solution does not decay
fast enough at infinity to be square integrable, will cause the phase shift of
$P$ wave at zero energy to increase an additional $\pi$.
