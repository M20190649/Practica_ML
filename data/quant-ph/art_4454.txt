Optimal eavesdropping in cryptography with three-dimensional quantum
  states
We study optimal eavesdropping in quantum cryptography with three-dimensional
systems, and show that this scheme is more secure than protocols using
two-dimensional states. We generalize the according eavesdropping
transformation to arbitrary dimensions, and discuss the connection with optimal
quantum cloning.
