QED using the nilpotent formalism
The nilpotent formalism for the Dirac equation, outlined in previous
papers,is applied to QED. It is shown that what is usually described as
'renormalization' is effectively a statement of the fact that the nilpotent
formulation is automatically second quantized and constrains the field into
producing finite values for fundamental quantities.
