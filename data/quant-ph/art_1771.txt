Internal Time Peculiarities as a Cause of Bifurcations Arising in
  Classical Trajectory Problem and Quantum Chaos Creation in Three-Body System
A new formulation of the theory of quantum mechanical multichannel scattering
for three-body collinear systems is proposed. It is shown, that in this simple
case the principle of quantum determinism in the general case breaks down and
we have a micro-irreversible quantum mechanics. The first principle
calculations of the quantum chaos (wave chaos) were pursued on the example of
an elementary chemical reaction Li+(FH)->(LiFH)*->(LiF)+H.
