On the squeezed states for n observables
Three basic properties (eigenstate, orbit and intelligence) of the canonical
squeezed states (SS) are extended to the case of arbitrary n observables. The
SS for n observables X_i can be constructed as eigenstates of their linear
complex combinations or as states which minimize the Robertson uncertainty
relation. When X_i close a Lie algebra L the generalized SS could also be
introduced as orbit of Aut(L^C). It is shown that for the nilpotent algebra h_N
the three generalizations are equivalent. For the simple su(1,1) the family of
eigenstates of uK_- + vK_+ (K_\pm being lowering and raising operators) is a
family of ideal K_1-K_2 SS, but it cannot be represented as an Aut(su^C(1,1))
orbit although the SU(1,1) group related coherent states (CS) with symmetry are
contained in it.
  Eigenstates |z,u,v,w;k> of general combination uK_- + vK_+ + wK_3 of the
three generators K_j of SU(1,1) in the representations with Bargman index k =
1/2,1, ..., and k = 1/4,3/4 are constructed and discussed in greater detail.
These are ideal SS for K_{1,2,3}. In the case of the one mode realization of
su(1,1) the nonclassical properties (sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature
squeezing) of the generalized even CS |z,u,v;+> are demonstrated. The states
|z,u,v,w;k=1/4,3/4> can exhibit strong both linear and quadratic squeezing.
