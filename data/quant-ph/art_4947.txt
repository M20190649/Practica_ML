How macroscopic properties dictate microscopic probabilities
We argue that the quantum probability law follows, in the large N limit, from
the compatibility of quantum mechanics with classical-like properties of
macroscopic objects. For a finite sample, we find that likely and unlikely
measurement outcomes are associated with distinct interference effects in a
sample weakly coupled to an environment.
