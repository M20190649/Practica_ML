A Quantum Bit Commitment Protocol Based on EPR States
A protocol for quantum bit commitment is proposed. The protocol is feasible
with present technology and is secure against cheaters with unlimited computing
power as long as the sender does not have the technology to store an EPR
particle for an arbitrarily long period of time. The protocol is very
efficient, requiring only tens of particles.
