Variational Perturbation Theory for the Ground-State Wave Function
We evaluate perturbatively the density matrix in the low-temperature limit
and thus the ground-state wave function of the anharmonic oscillator up to
second order in the coupling constant. We then employ Kleinert's variational
perturbation theory to determine the ground-state wave function for all
coupling strengths.
