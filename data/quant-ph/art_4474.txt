A Novel Approach to Quantum Heuristics for Structured Database Search
An algorithm for structured database searching is presented and used to solve
the set partition problem. O(n) oracle calls are required in order to obtain a
solution, but the probability that this solution is optimal decreases
exponentially with problem size. Each oracle call is followed by a measurement,
implying that it is necessary to maintain quantum coherence for only one oracle
call at a time.
