Lower bound for the quantum capacity of a discrete memoryless quantum
  channel
We generalize the random coding argument of stabilizer codes and derive a
lower bound on the quantum capacity of an arbitrary discrete memoryless quantum
channel. For the depolarizing channel, our lower bound coincides with that
obtained by Bennett et al. We also slightly improve the quantum
Gilbert-Varshamov bound for general stabilizer codes, and establish an analogue
of the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound for linear stabilizer codes. Our proof
is restricted to the binary quantum channels, but its extension of to l-adic
channels is straightforward.
