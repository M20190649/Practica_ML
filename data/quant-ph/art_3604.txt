Entropic uncertainty relation for power-law wave packets
For the power-law quantum wave packet in configuration space, the variance of
the position observable may be divergent. Accordingly, the information-entropic
formulation of the uncertainty principle becomes more appropriate than the
Heisenberg-type formulation, since it involves only the finite quantities. It
is found that the total amount of entropic uncertainty converges to its lower
bound in the limit of a large value of the exponent.
