Realistic lower bounds for the factorization time of large numbers on a
  quantum computer
We investigate the time T a quantum computer requires to factorize a given
number dependent on the number of bits L required to represent this number. We
stress the fact that in most cases one has to take into account that the
execution time of a single quantum gate is related to the decoherence time of
the qubits that are involved in the computation. Although exhibited here only
for special systems, this inter-dependence of decoherence and computation time
seems to be a restriction in many current models for quantum computers and
leads to the result that the computation time T scales much stronger with L
than previously expected.
