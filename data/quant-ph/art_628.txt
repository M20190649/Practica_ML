A Framework for Structured Quantum Search
A quantum algorithm for general combinatorial search that uses the underlying
structure of the search space to increase the probability of finding a solution
is presented. This algorithm shows how coherent quantum systems can be matched
to the underlying structure of abstract search spaces, and is analytically
simpler than previous structured search methods. The algorithm is evaluated
empirically with a variety of search problems, and shown to be particularly
effective for searches with many constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm
provides a simple framework for utilizing search heuristics. It also exhibits
the same phase transition in search difficulty as found for sophisticated
classical search methods, indicating it is effectively using the problem
structure.
