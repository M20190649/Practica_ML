Thermalized Displaced and Squeezed Number States in Coordinate
  Representation
Within the framework of thermofield dynamics, the wavefunctions of the
thermalized displaced number and squeezed number states are given in the
coordinate representation. Furthermore, the time evolution of these
wavefunctions is considered by introducing a thermal coordinate representation,
and we also calculate the corresponding probability densities, average values
and variances of position coordinate, which are consistent with results in the
literature.
