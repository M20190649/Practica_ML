Preparation of Schr√∂dinger cat states with cold ions beyond the
  Lamb-Dicke limit
A scheme for preparing Schr\"odinger cat (SC) states is proposed beyond the
Lamb-Dicke limit in a Raman-$\Lambda$-type configuration. It is shown that SC
states can be obtained more efficiently with our scheme than with the former
ones.
