Nonbinary Quantum Stabilizer Codes
We define and show how to construct nonbinary quantum stabilizer codes. Our
approach is based on nonbinary error bases. It generalizes the relationship
between selforthogonal codes over $GF_{4}$ and binary quantum codes to one
between selforthogonal codes over $GF_{q^2}$ and $q$-ary quantum codes for any
prime power $q$.
