Efficient microwave-induced optical frequency conversion
Frequency conversion process is studied in a medium of atoms with a $\Lambda$
configuration of levels, where transition between two lower states is driven by
a microwave field. In this system, conversion efficiency can be very high by
virtue of the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).
Depending on intensity of the microwave field, two regimes of EIT are realized:
''dark-state'' EIT for the weak field, and Autler-Townes-type EIT for the
strong one. We study both cases via analytical and numerical solution and find
optimum conditions for the conversion.
