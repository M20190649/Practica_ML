Nonstationary Casimir Effect and analytical solutions for quantum fields
  in cavities with moving boundaries
This is a review of publications on classical and quantum electrodynamics in
cavities with moving boundaries (in the quantum case this subject is labeled
frequently as "nonstationary Casimir effect" or "dynamical Casimir effect"),
from 1921 to October of 2000, with an emphasis on analytical results related to
cavities with resonantly oscillating boundaries.
