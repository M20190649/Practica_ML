Quantum channels of the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen kind
Assume the quantum state of a bipartite system is known. The result of local
von Neumann measurements can be described by maps from one subsystem to the
other one. Main properties of these antilinear ''EPR-channel'' maps are shortly
discussed. Talk in honour of Jan Lopuszanski.
