One-parameter Darboux-transformed quantum actions in Thermodynamics
We use nonrelativistic supersymmetry, mainly Darboux transformations of the
general (one-parameter) type, for the quantum oscillator thermodynamic actions.
Interesting Darboux generalizations of the fundamental Planck and pure vacuum
cases are discussed in some detail with relevant plots. It is shown that the
one-parameter Darboux-transformed Thermodynamics refers to superpositions of
boson and fermion excitations of positive and negative absolute temperature,
respectively. Recent results of Arnaud, Chusseau, and Philippe physics/0105048
regarding a single mode oscillator Carnot cycle are extended in the same
Darboux perspective. We also conjecture a Darboux generalization of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem
