Evolution loops and spin-1/2 systems
The derivation of a new family of magnetic fields inducing exactly solvable
spin evolutions is presented. The conditions for which these fields generate
the evolution loops (dynamical processes for which any spin state evolves
cyclically) are studied. Their natural connection with geometric phases and the
corresponding calculation is also elaborated.
