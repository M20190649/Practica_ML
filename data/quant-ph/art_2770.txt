Quantum CPU and Quantum Simulating
Making use of an universal quantum network or QCPU proposed by me [6], some
special quantum networks for simulating some quantum systems are given out.
Specially, it is obtained that the quantum network for the time evolution
operator which can simulate, in general, Schr\"odinger equation.
