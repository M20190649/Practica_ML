On the Security of Quantum Cryptography Against Collective Attacks
We present strong attacks against quantum key distribution schemes which use
quantum memories and quantum gates to attack directly the final key. We analyze
a specific attack of this type, for which we find the density matrices
available to the eavesdropper and the optimal information which can be
extracted from them. We prove security against this attack and discuss security
against any attack allowed by the rules of quantum mechanics.
