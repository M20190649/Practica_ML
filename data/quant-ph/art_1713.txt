Interference effects in two-photon ATI by multiple orders high harmonics
  with random or locked phases
We numerically study 2-photon processes using a set of harmonics from a
Ti:Sapphire laser and in particular interference effects in the Above Threshold
Ionization spectra. We compare the situation where the harmonic phases are
assumed locked to the case where they have a random distribution. Suggestions
for possible experiments, using realistic parameters are discussed.
