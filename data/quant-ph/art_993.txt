Maximally Robust Unravelings of Quantum Master Equations
The stationary solution \rho of a quantum master equation can be represented
as an ensemble of pure states in a continuous infinity of ways. An ensemble
which is physically realizable through monitoring the system's environment we
call an `unraveling'. The survival probability S(t) of an unraveling is the
average probability for each of its elements to be unchanged a time t after
cessation of monitoring. The maximally robust unraveling is the one for which
S(t) remains greater than the largest eigenvalue of \rho for the longest time.
The optical parametric oscillator is a soluble example.
