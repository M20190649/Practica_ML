A Lie algebraic approach to complex quasi exactly solvable potentials
  with real spectrum
We use a Lie algebraic technique to construct complex quasi exactly solvable
potentials with real spectrum. In particular we obtain exact solutions of a
complex sextic oscillator potential and also a complex potential belonging to
the Morse family.
