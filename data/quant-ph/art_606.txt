Decoherence and Initial Correlations in Quantum Brownian Motion
We analyze the evolution of a quantum Brownian particle starting from an
initial state that contains correlations between this system and its
environment. Using a path integral approach, we obtain a master equation for
the reduced density matrix of the system finding relatively simple expressions
for its time dependent coefficients. We examine the evolution of delocalized
initial states (Schr\"odinger's cats) investigating the effectiveness of the
decoherence process. Analytic results are obtained for an ohmic environment
(Drude's model) at zero temperature.
