Effects of motion in cavity QED
We consider effects of motion in cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments
where single cold atoms can now be observed inside the cavity for many Rabi
cycles. We discuss the timescales involved in the problem and the need for good
control of the atomic motion, particularly the heating due to exchange of
excitation between the atom and the cavity, in order to realize nearly unitary
dynamics of the internal atomic states and the cavity mode which is required
for several schemes of current interest such as quantum computing. Using a
simple model we establish ultimate effects of the external atomic degrees of
freedom on the action of quantum gates. The perfomance of the gate is
characterized by a measure based on the entanglement fidelity and the motional
excitation caused by the action of the gate is calculated. We find that schemes
which rely on adiabatic passage, and are not therefore critically dependent on
laser pulse areas, are very much more robust against interaction with the
external degrees of freedom of atoms in the quantum gate.
