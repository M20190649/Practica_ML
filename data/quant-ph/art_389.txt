Heisenberg-picture approach to the exact quantum motion of a
  time-dependent forced harmonic oscillator
In the Heisenberg picture, the generalized invariant and exact quantum
motions are found for a time-dependent forced harmonic oscillator. We find the
eigenstate and the coherent state of the invariant and show that the
dispersions of these quantum states do not depend on the external force. Our
formalism is applied to several interesting cases.
