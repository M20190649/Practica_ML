Experimental demonstration of quantum correlations over more than 10 km
Energy and time entangled photons at a wavelength of 1310 nm are produced by
parametric downconversion in a KNbO3 crystal and are sent into all-fiber
interferometers using a telecom fiber network. The two interferometers of this
Franson-type test of the Bell-inequality are located 10.9 km apart from one
another. Two-photon fringe visibilities of up to 81.6 % are obtained. These
strong nonlocal correlations support the nonlocal predictions of quantum
mechanics and provide evidence that entanglement between photons can be
maintained over long distances.
