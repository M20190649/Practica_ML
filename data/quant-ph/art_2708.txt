On Symmetries in Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics
It is shown how nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics can be refolmulated
in terms of a (linear) C*-algebraic theory. Then also their symmetries are
described as automorphisms of the correspondong C*-algebra. The requirement of
"conservation of transition probabilities" is discussed.
