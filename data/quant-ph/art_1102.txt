Statistics for Particles Having Internal Quantum State
A new kind of quantum statistics which interpolates between Bose and Fermi
statistics is proposed beginning with the assumption that the quantum state of
a many-particle system is a functional on the internal space of the particles.
The quantum commutation relations for such particle creation and annihilation
operators are derived, and statistical partition function and thermodynamical
properties of an ideal gas of the particles are investigated. The application
of this quantum statistics for the ensemble of extremal black holes are
discussed.
