Creating massive entanglement of Bose condensed atoms
We propose a direct, coherent coupling scheme that can create massively
entangled states of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms. Our idea is based on an
effective interaction between two atoms from coherent Raman processes through a
(two atom) molecular intermediate state. We compare our scheme with other
recent proposals for generation of massive entanglement of Bose condensed
atoms.
