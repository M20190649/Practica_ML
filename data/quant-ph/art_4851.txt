Entanglement and the factorization-approximation
For a bi-partite quantum system defined in a finite dimensional Hilbert space
we investigate in what sense entanglement change and interactions imply each
other. For this purpose we introduce an entanglement operator, which is then
shown to represent a non-conserved property for any bi-partite system and any
type of interaction. This general relation does not exclude the existence of
special initial product states, for which the entanglement remains small over
some period of time, despite interactions. For this case we derive an
approximation to the full Schroedinger equation, which allows the treatment of
the composite systems in terms of product states. The induced error is
estimated. In this factorization-approximation one subsystem appears as an
effective potential for the other. A pertinent example is the Jaynes-Cummings
model, which then reduces to the semi-classical rotating wave approximation.
