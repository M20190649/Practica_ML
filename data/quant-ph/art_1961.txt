Optimal squeezing, pure states, and amplification of squeezing in
  resonance fluorescence
It is shown that 100% squeezed output can be produced in the resonance
fluorescence from a coherently driven two-level atom interacting with a
squeezed vacuum. This is only possible for $N=1/8$ squeezed input, and is
associated with a pure atomic state, i.e., a completely polarized state. The
quadrature for which optimal squeezing occurs depends on the squeezing phase
$\Phi ,$ the Rabi frequency $\Omega ,$ and the atomic detuning $\Delta $. Pure
states are described for arbitrary $\Phi ,$ not just $\Phi =0$ or $\pi $ as in
previous work. For small values of $N,$ there may be a greater degree of
squeezing in the output field than the input - i.e., we have squeezing
amplification.
