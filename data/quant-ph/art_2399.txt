Quantum tomography of the GHZ state
We present a method of generation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state
involving type II and type I parametric downconversion, and triggering
photodetectors. The state generated by the proposed experimental set-up can be
reconstructed through multi-mode quantum homodyne tomography. The feasibility
of the measurement is studied on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations.
