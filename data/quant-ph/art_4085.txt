Enhanced Estimation of a Noisy Quantum Channel Using Entanglement
We discuss the estimation of channel parameters for a noisy quantum channel -
the so-called Pauli channel - using finite resources. It turns out that prior
entanglement considerably enhances the fidelity of the estimation when we
compare it to an estimation scheme based on separable quantum states.
