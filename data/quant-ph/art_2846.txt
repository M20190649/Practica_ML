Unconditionally Secure Relativistic Quantum Bit Commitment
A new relativistic quantum protocol is proposed allowing to implement the bit
commitment scheme. The protocol is based on the idea that in the relativistic
case the field propagation to the region of space accessible to measurement
requires, contrary to the non-relativistic case, a finite non-zero time which
depends on the structure of the particular state of the field. In principle,
the secret bit can be stored for arbitrarily long time with the probability
arbitrarily close to unit.
