Semiclassical Density Matrix Near the Top of a Barrier
Employing the path integral approach, we calculate the semiclassical
equilibrium density matrix of a particle moving in a nonlinear potential field
for coordinates near the top of a potential barrier. As the temperature is
decreased, near a critical temperature $T_c$ the harmonic approximation for the
fluctuation path integral fails. This is due to a caustic arising at a
bifurcation point of the classical paths. We provide a selfconsistent scheme to
treat the large quantum fluctuations leading to a nonlinear fluctuation
potential. The procedure differs from methods used near caustics of the real
time propagator. The semiclassical density matrix is determined explicitly for
the case of asymmetric barriers from high temperatures down to temperatures
somewhat below $T_c$.
