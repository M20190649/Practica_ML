Condensate fluctuations of a trapped, ideal Bose gas
For a non-self-interacting Bose gas with a fixed, large number of particles
confined to a trap, as the ground state occupation becomes macroscopic, the
condensate number fluctuations remain micrscopic. However, this is the only
significant aspect in which the grand canonical description differs from
canonical or microcanonical in the thermodynamic limit. General arguments and
estimates including some vanishingly small quantities are compared to explicit,
fixed-number calculations for 10^2 to 10^6 particles.
