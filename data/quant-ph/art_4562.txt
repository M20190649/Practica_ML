Exact trace formulae for a class of one-dimensional ray-splitting
  systems
Based on quantum graph theory we establish that the ray-splitting trace
formula proposed by Couchman {\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. A {\bf 46}, 6193 (1992))
is exact for a class of one-dimensional ray-splitting systems. Important
applications in combinatorics are suggested.
