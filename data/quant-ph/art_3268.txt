L'ordinateur quantique
Project of an undergraduate student in physics (4th year) about the concept
of quantum computers (QC) and its social impact. After a thourough theoretical
introduction (chap. 2), the recent debate about NMR-based QC is dealt with in
detail (chap. 3). Chapter 4 comments on the figure of the number of articles
published on the subject, showing the dramatic growth after the publication of
Shor's algorithm.
