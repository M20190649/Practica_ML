Trapping state restoration in the randomly-driven Jaynes-Cummings model
  by conditional measurements
We propose a scheme which can effectively restore fixed points in the quantum
dynamics of repeated Jaynes-Cummings interactions followed by atomic state
measurements, when the interaction times fluctuate randomly. It is based on
selection of superposed atomic states whose phase correlations tend to suppress
the phase fluctuations of each separate state. One suggested realization
involves the convergence of the cavity field distribution to a single Fock
state by conditional measurements performed on two-level atoms with fluctuating
velocities after they cross the cavity. Another realization involves a trapped
ion whose internal-motional state coupling fluctuates randomly. Its motional
state is made to converge to a Fock state by conditional measurements of the
internal state of the ion.
