Event-ready entanglement preparation
We present an experiment which prepare entanglement between photons that
nowhere interacted and whose paths nowhere crossed. The experiment puts
together two photons from two (non-maximal) singlet-like photon pairs and make
them interfere at an asymmetrical beam splitter. As a result one finds
polarization correlations between the other companion photons from the pairs
whose paths nowhere crossed each other even when no polarization measurements
have been carried out on the former photons. The latter set of photons that
nowhere interacted are therefore event-ready prepared by their pair-companion
photons. The result reveals nonlocality as a property of selection which can
even be a preselection. It also reveals that one can predict spin-correlated
behaviour of photons in space and at beam splitters by controlling a no-spin
observable. [From the Book of Abstracts as appeared at the Workshop.]
