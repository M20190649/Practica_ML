A Feynman-Kac Formula for Anticommuting Brownian Motion
Motivated by application to quantum physics, anticommuting analogues of
Wiener measure and Brownian motion are constructed. The corresponding Ito
integrals are defined and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a class
of stochastic differential equations is established. This machinery is used to
provide a Feynman-Kac formula for a class of Hamiltonians. Several specific
examples are considered.
