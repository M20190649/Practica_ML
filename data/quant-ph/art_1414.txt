Reconstruction of photon distribution with positivity constraints
An iterative algorithm for reconstructing the photon distribution from the
random phase homodyne statistics is discussed. This method, derived from the
maximum-likelihood approach, yields a positive definite estimate for the photon
distribution with bounded statistical errors even if numerical compensation for
the detector imperfection is applied.
