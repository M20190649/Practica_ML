Realism and Time Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics
We describe a gedanken experiment with an interferometer in the case of pre-
and postselection in two different time symmetric ways: We apply the ABL
formalism and the de Broglie--Bohm model. Interpreting these descriptions
ontologically, we get two very different concepts of reality. Finally, we
discuss some problems implied by these concepts.
