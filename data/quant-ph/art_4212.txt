An NMR Analog of the Quantum Disentanglement Eraser
We report the implementation of a three-spin quantum disentanglement eraser
on a liquid-state NMR quantum information processor. A key feature of this
experiment was its use of pulsed magnetic field gradients to mimic projective
measurements. This ability is an important step towards the development of an
experimentally controllable system which can simulate any quantum dynamics,
both coherent and decoherent.
