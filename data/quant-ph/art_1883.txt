Entanglement and visibility at the output of a Mach-Zehnder
  interferometer
We study the entanglement between the two beams exiting a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer fed by a couple of squeezed-coherent states with arbitrary
squeezing parameter. The quantum correlations at the output are function of the
internal phase-shift of the interferometer, with the output state ranging from
a totally disentangled state to a state whose degree of entanglement is an
increasing function of the input squeezing parameter. A couple of squeezed
vacuum at the input leads to maximum entangled state at the output. The fringes
visibilities resulting from measuring the coincidence counting rate or the
squared difference photocurrent are evaluated and compared each other.
Homodyne-like detection turns out to be preferable in almost all situations,
with the exception of the very low signals regime.
