Carmichael Numbers on a Quantum Computer
We present a quantum probabilistic algorithm which tests with a polynomial
computational complexity whether a given composite number is of the Carmichael
type. We also suggest a quantum algorithm which could verify a conjecture by
Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff concerning the asymptotic distribution of
Carmichael numbers smaller than a given integer.
