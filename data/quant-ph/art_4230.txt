Unambiguous Discrimination Between Linearly Dependent States with
  Multiple Copies
A set of quantum states can be unambiguously discriminated if and only if
they are linearly independent. However, for a linearly dependent set, if C
copies of the state are available, then the resulting C particle states may
form a linearly independent set, and be amenable to unambiguous discrimination.
We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of
unambiguous discrimination between N states given that C copies are available
and that the single copies span a D dimensional space. These conditions are
found to be identical for qubits. We then examine in detail the linearly
dependent trine ensemble. The set of C>1 copies of each state is a set of
linearly independent lifted trine states. The maximum unambiguous
discrimination probability is evaluated for all C>1 with equal a priori
probabilities.
