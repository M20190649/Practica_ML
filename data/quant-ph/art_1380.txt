Relationship between quantum decoherence times and solvation dynamics in
  condensed phase chemical systems
A relationship between the time scales of quantum coherence loss and
short-time solvent response for a solute/bath system is derived for a Gaussian
wave packet approximation for the bath. Decoherence and solvent response times
are shown to be directly proportional to each other, with the proportionality
coefficient given by the ratio of the thermal energy fluctuations to the
fluctuations in the system-bath coupling. The relationship allows the
prediction of decoherence times for condensed phase chemical systems from well
developed experimental methods.
