A single atom in free space as a quantum aperture
We calculate exact 3-D solutions of Maxwell equations corresponding to
strongly focused light beams, and study their interaction with a single atom in
free space. We show how the naive picture of the atom as an absorber with a
size given by its radiative cross section $\sigma =3\lambda ^{2}/2\pi $ must be
modified. The implications of these results for quantum information processing
capabilities of trapped atoms are discussed.
