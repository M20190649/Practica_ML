A universal cloner allowing the input to be arbitrary states in
  symmetric subspace
A generalized universal quantum cloning machine is proposed which allows the
input to be arbitrary states in symmetric subspace. And it reduces to the
universal quantum cloning machine (UQCM) if the input are identical pure
states. The generalized cloner is optimal in the sense we compare the input and
output reduced density operators at a single qubit. The result for qubits is
extended to arbitrary-dimensional states.
