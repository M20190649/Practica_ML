Quantitative wave-particle duality and non-erasing quantum erasure
The notion of wave-particle duality may be quantified by the inequality
V^2+K^2 <=1, relating interference fringe visibility V and path knowledge K.
With a single-photon interferometer in which polarization is used to label the
paths, we have investigated the relation for various situations, including
pure, mixed, and partially-mixed input states. A quantum eraser scheme has been
realized that recovers interference fringes even when no which-way information
is available to erase.
