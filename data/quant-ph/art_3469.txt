More on Optical Holonomic Quantum Computer
We in this paper consider a further generalization of the (optical) holonomic
quantum computation proposed by Zanardi and Rasetti (quant-ph/9904011), and
reinforced by Fujii (quant-ph/9910069) and Pachos and Chountasis
(quant-ph/9912093). We construct a quantum computational bundle on some
parameter space, and calculate non-abelian Berry connections and curvatures
explicitly in the special cases. Our main tool is unitary coherent operators
based on Lie algebras su(n+1) and su(n,1), where the case of n = 1 is the
previous one.
