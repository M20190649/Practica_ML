Decoherence and the Quantum Zeno Effect
The measurements in the optical test of quantum Zeno effect [Itano et al.
Phys. Rev. A\underbar{41} (1990) 2295) are analyzed using the
environment-induced decoherence theory, where the spontaneous emission lifetime
of the relevant level emerges as the 'decoherence time'. The implication of
this finite decoherence time in setting a fundamental limit on the
realizability of the condition of continuous measurements is investigated in
detail.
