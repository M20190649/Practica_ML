Consistent Histories and the Bohm Approach
In a recent paper Griffiths claims that the consistent histories
interpretation of quantum mechanics gives rise to results that contradict those
obtained from the Bohm interpretation. This is in spite of the fact that both
claim to provide a realist interpretation of the formalism without the need to
add any new mathematical content and both always produce exactly the same
probability predictions of the outcome of experiments. In constrasting the
differences Griffiths argues that the consistent histories interpretation
provides a more physically reasonable account of quantum phenomena. We examine
this claim and show that the consistent histories approach is not without its
difficulties.
