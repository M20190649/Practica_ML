Quantum mechanics with the permitted hidden parameters
Within the framework of the algebraic approach the problem of hidden
parameters in quantum mechanics is surveyed. It is shown that the algebraic
formulation of quantum mechanics permits introduction of a specific hidden
parameter, which has the form of nonlinear functional on the algebra of
observables. It is found out that the reasoning of von Neumann and of Bell
about incompatibility of quantum mechanics with hidden parameters is
inapplicable to the present case.
