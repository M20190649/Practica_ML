Efficient quantum computing on low temperature spin ensembles
A new scheme is proposed which will permit electron spin resonance pulse
techniques to be used to realize a quantum computer with a 100 qbits, or more.
The computation is performed on effective pure states which correspond to
off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix. Described is a scheme which very
efficiently performs the preparation stage and which permits
``pseudo-projective measurement'' to be made on the output. With such
measurements all members of the ensemble remain coherent.
