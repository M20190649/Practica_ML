Squeezing and photon distribution in a vibrating cavity
We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the quadrature variances and
the photon distribution functions of the electromagnetic field modes excited
from vacuum or thermal states due to the non-stationary Casimir effect in an
ideal one-dimensional Fabry--Perot cavity with vibrating walls, provided the
frequency of vibrations is close to a multiple frequency of the fundamental
unperturbed electromagnetic mode.
