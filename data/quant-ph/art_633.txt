The wave function in Quantum Mechanics
Through a new interpretation of Special Theory of Relativity and with a model
given for physical space, we can find a way to understand the basic principles
of Quantum Mechanics consistently from Classical Theory. It is supposed that
natural phenomena have a connection with intangible reality which cannot be
measured directly. Furthermore, the intangible reality is supposed as vacuum
particles -- stationary vacuum electrons as a model. In addition, 4-Dimensional
Complex Space is introduced, in which each dimension has an internal complex
space.
