Two qubit copying machine for economical quantum eavesdropping
We study the mapping which occurs when a single qubit in an arbitrary state
interacts with another qubit in a given, fixed state resulting in some unitary
transformation on the two qubit system which, in effect, makes two copies of
the first qubit. The general problem of the quality of the resulting copies is
discussed using a special representation, a generalization of the usual Schmidt
decomposition, of an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace of a tensor product of
two 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We exhibit quantum circuits which can
reproduce the results of any two qubit copying machine of this type. A simple
stochastic generalization (using a ``classical'' random signal) of the copying
machine is also considered. These copying machines provide simple embodiments
of previously proposed optimal eavesdropping schemes for the BB84 and B92
quantum cryptography protocols.
