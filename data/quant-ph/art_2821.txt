Semiclassical Approximation for Periodic Potentials
We derive the semiclassical WKB quantization condition for obtaining the
energy band edges of periodic potentials. The derivation is based on an
approach which is much simpler than the usual method of interpolating with
linear potentials in the regions of the classical turning points. The band
structure of several periodic potentials is computed using our semiclassical
quantization condition.
