Consistent Histories and Operational Quantum Physics
In this work a generalization of the consistent histories approach to quantum
mechanics is presented. We first critically review the consistent histories
approach to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in a mathematically rigorous way
and give some general comments about it. We investigate to what extent the
consistent histories scheme is compatible with the results of the operational
formulation of quantum mechanics. According to the operational approach
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is most generally formulated in terms of
effects, states and operations. We formulate a generalized consistent histories
theory using the concepts and the terminology which have proven useful in the
operational formulation of quantum mechanics. The logical rule of the logical
interpretation of quantum mechanics is generalized to the present context. The
algebraic structure of the generalized theory is studied in detail.
