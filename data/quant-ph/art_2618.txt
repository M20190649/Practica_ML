Comment on ``Validity of Feynman's prescription of disregarding the
  Pauli principle in intermediate states''
In a recent paper Coutinho, Nogami and Tomio [Phys. Rev. A 59, 2624 (1999);
quant-ph/9812073] presented an example in which, they claim, Feynman's
prescription of disregarding the Pauli principle in intermediate states of
perturbation theory fails. We show that, contrary to their claim, Feynman's
prescription is consistent with the exact solution of their example.
