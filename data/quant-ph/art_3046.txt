Entangled SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states
Entangled SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states are developed as superpositions
of multiparticle SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states. In certain cases, these are
coherent states with respect to generalized su(2) and su(1,1) generators, and
multiparticle parity states arise as a special case. As a special example of
entangled SU(2) coherent states, entangled binomial states are introduced and
these entangled binomial states enable the contraction from entangled SU(2)
coherent states to entangled harmonic oscillator coherent states. Entangled
SU(2) coherent states are discussed in the context of pairs of qubits. We also
introduce the entangled negative binomial states and entangled squeezed states
as examples of entangled SU(1,1) coherent states. A method for generating the
entangled SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states is discussed and degrees of
entanglement calculated. Two types of SU(1,1) coherent states are discussed in
each case: Perelomov coherent states and Barut-Girardello coherent states.
