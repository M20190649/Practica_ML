Relativistic nonlocality (RNL) in experiments with moving polarizers and
  2 non-before impacts
Relativistic nonlocality (RNL) is a recently proposed relativistic nonlocal
description which unifies relativity of simultaneity and superluminal
nonlocality (without superluminal signaling). In this article RNL is applied to
experiments with so-called 2 non-before impacts, leading to new rules of
calculating the joint probabilities, and predictions conflicting with quantum
mechanics. A real experiment using fast moving polarizing beam-splitters is
proposed.
