A classical analogue of entanglement
We show that quantum entanglement has a very close classical analogue, namely
secret classical correlations. The fundamental analogy stems from the behavior
of quantum entanglement under local operations and classical communication and
the behavior of secret correlations under local operations and public
communication. A large number of derived analogies follow. In particular
teleportation is analogous to the one-time-pad, the concept of ``pure state''
exists in the classical domain, entanglement concentration and dilution are
essentially classical secrecy protocols, and single copy entanglement
manipulations have such a close classical analog that the majorization results
are reproduced in the classical setting. This analogy allows one to import
questions from the quantum domain into the classical one, and vice-versa,
helping to get a better understanding of both. Also, by identifying classical
aspects of quantum entanglement it allows one to identify those aspects of
entanglement which are uniquely quantum mechanical.
