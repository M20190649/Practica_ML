Bose condensation in two dimensions with disorder: Gross-Pitaevskii
  approach
Bose condensation of interacting bosons in a two-dimensional random potential
is studied. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved to determine the
spatially-varying order parameter and the localization length as a function of
the disorder, the interaction strength, and the condensate density. A finite
temperature of condensation is obtained thereby. The results are applied to
determination of the superradiant decay of excitons in a GaAs quantum well.
