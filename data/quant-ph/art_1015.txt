Proposed experimental tests of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem
For a two-particle two-state system, sets of compatible propositions exist
for which quantum mechanics and noncontextual hidden-variable theories make
conflicting predictions for every individual system whatever its quantum state.
This permits a simple all-or-nothing state-independent experimental
verification of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem.
