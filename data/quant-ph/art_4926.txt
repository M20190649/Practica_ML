Perturbation Approach for a Solid-State Quantum Computation
The dynamics of the nuclear-spin quantum computer with large number (L=1000)
of qubits is considered using a perturbation approach, based on approximate
diagonalization of exponentially large sparse matrices. Small parameters are
introduced and used to compute the error in implementation of entanglement
between remote qubits, by applying a sequence of resonant radio-frequency
pulses. The results of the perturbation theory are tested using exact numerical
solutions for small number of qubits.
