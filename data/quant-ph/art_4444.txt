Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Experiment to Measure Both Photon
  Trajectories and Double-Slit Interference
Recent work using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has made
possible investigations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in its original
(position-momentum) form. We propose an experiment that uses SPDC photon pairs
to measure through which slit a photon passes while simultaneously observing
double-slit interference.
