Spin dynamics of wave packets evolving with the Dirac Hamiltonian in
  atoms with high Z
The motion of circular WP for one electron in central Coulomb field with high
Z is calculated. The WP is defined in terms of solutions of the Dirac equation
in order to take into account all possible relevant effects in particular the
spin-orbit potential. A time scale is defined within which spin dynamics must
be taken into account mainly in the atoms with high Z. Within this time scale
there exists a mechanism of collapses and revivals of the spin already shown by
the authors for harmonic oscillator potential and called the 'spin-orbit
pendulum'. However this effect has not the exact periodicity of the simpler
model, but the WP's spatial motion is nevertheless quite similar.
