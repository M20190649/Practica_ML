Mimicking a Squeezed Bath Interaction: Quantum Reservoir Engineering
  with Atoms
The interaction of an atomic two-level system and a squeezed vacuum leads to
interesting novel effects in atomic dynamics, including line narrowing in
resonance fluorescence and absorption spectra, and a suppressed (enhanced)
decay of the in-phase and out-of phase component of the atomic polarization. On
the experimental side these predictions have so far eluded observation,
essentially due to the difficulty of embedding atoms in a 4 pi squeezed vacuum.
In this paper we show how to ``engineer'' a squeezed-bath-type interaction for
an effective two-level system. In the simplest example, our two-level atom is
represented by the two ground levels of an atom with angular momentum J=1/2 ->
J=1/2 transition (a four level system) which is driven by (weak) laser fields
and coupled to the vacuum reservoir of radiation modes. Interference between
the spontaneous emission channels in optical pumping leads to a squeezed bath
type coupling, and thus to symmetry breaking of decay on the Bloch sphere. With
this system it should be possible to observe the effects predicted in the
context of squeezed bath - atom interactions. The laser parameters allow one to
choose properties of the squeezed bath interaction, such as the (effective)
photon number expectation number N and the squeezing phase phi. We present
results of a detailed analytical and numerical study.
