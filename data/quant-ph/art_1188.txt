Expressing the operations of quantum computing in multiparticle
  geometric algebra
We show how the basic operations of quantum computing can be expressed and
manipulated in a clear and concise fashion using a multiparticle version of
geometric (aka Clifford) algebra. This algebra encompasses the product operator
formalism of NMR spectroscopy, and hence its notation leads directly to
implementations of these operations via NMR pulse sequences.
