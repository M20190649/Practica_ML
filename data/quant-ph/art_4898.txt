Formal solutions of stargenvalue equations
The formal solution of a general stargenvalue equation is presented, its
properties studied and a geometrical interpretation given in terms of
star-hypersurfaces in quantum phase space. Our approach deals with discrete and
continuous spectra in a unified fashion and includes a systematic treatment of
non-diagonal stargenfunctions. The formalism is used to obtain a complete
formal solution of Wigner quantum mechanics in the Heisenberg picture and to
write a general formula for the stargenfunctions of Hamiltonians quadratic in
the phase space variables in arbitrary dimension. A variety of systems is then
used to illustrate the former results.
