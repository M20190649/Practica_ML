Testing the symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics and the
  spin-statistics connection
Recent experimental tests of the symmetrization postulate of quantum
mechanics are discussed. It is shown that in a strict sense these experiments
cannot test the validity of the symmetrization postulate, but in most cases do
test the spin-statistics connection. An experiment is proposed that would allow
to search for possible violations of the symmetrization postulate.
