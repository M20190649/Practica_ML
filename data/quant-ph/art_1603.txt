Tomography of Quantum Spinor States
A possibility of describing two-level atom states in terms of positive
probability distributions (analog to the symplectic tomography scheme) is
considered. As a result the basis of the irreducible representation of a
rotation group can be realized by a family of the probability distributions of
the spin projection parametrized by points on the sphere. Furthermore the
tomography of rotational states of molecules and nuclei which can be described
by the model of a symmetric top is discussed.
