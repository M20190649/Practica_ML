A Fast and Compact Quantum Random Number Generator
We present the realization of a physical quantum random number generator
based on the process of splitting a beam of photons on a beam splitter, a
quantum mechanical source of true randomness. By utilizing either a beam
splitter or a polarizing beam splitter, single photon detectors and high speed
electronics the presented devices are capable of generating a binary random
signal with an autocorrelation time of 11.8 ns and a continuous stream of
random numbers at a rate of 1 Mbit/s. The randomness of the generated signals
and numbers is shown by running a series of tests upon data samples. The
devices described in this paper are built into compact housings and are simple
to operate.
