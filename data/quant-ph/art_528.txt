A New Time-Scale for Tunneling
We study the tunneling through an oscillating delta barrier. Using time
periodicity of the model, the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is reduced
to a simple but infinite matrix equation. Employing Toeplitz matrices methods,
the infinite matrix is replaces by a $3\times 3$ matrix, allowing an analytical
solution. Looking at the frequency dependence of the transmissionamplitudes,
one observes a new time scale which dominates the tunneling dynamics. This time
scale differs from the one previously introduced by B\"uttiker and Landauer.
The relation between these two is discussed.
