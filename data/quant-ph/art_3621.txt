Squeezing of electromagnetic field in a cavity by electrons in Trojan
  states
The notion of the Trojan state of a Rydberg electron, introduced by
I.Bialynicki-Birula, M.Kali\'nski, and J.H.Eberly (Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 1777
(1994)) is extended to the case of the electromagnetic field quantized in
acavity. The shape of the electronic wave packet describing the Trojan state is
practically the same as in the previously studied externally driven system. The
fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field around its classical value
exhibit strong squeezing. The emergence of Trojan states in the cylindrically
symmetrical system is attributed to spontaneous symmetry braking.
