Unraveling quantum dissipation in the frequency domain
We present a quantum Monte Carlo method for solving the evolution of an open
quantum system. In our approach, the density operator evolution is unraveled in
the frequency domain. Significant advantages of this approach arise when the
frequency of each dissipative event conveys information about the state of the
system.
