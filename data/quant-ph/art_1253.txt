Energy Ambiguity in Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics
We observe that in nonlinear quantum mechanics, unlike in the linear theory,
there exists, in general, a difference between the energy functional defined
within the Lagrangian formulation as an appropriate conserved component of the
canonical energy-momentum tensor and the energy functional defined as the
expectation value of the corresponding nonlinear Hamiltonian operator. Some
examples of such ambiguity are presented for a particularly simple model and
some known modifications. However, we point out that there exist a class of
nonlinear modifications of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation where this difference
does not occur, which makes them more consistent in a manner similar to that of
the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. It is found that necessary but not
sufficient a condition for such modifications is the homogeneity of the
modified Schr\"{o}dinger equation or its underlying Lagrangian density which is
assumed to be ``bilinear'' in the wave function in some rather general sense.
Yet, it is only for a particular form of this density that the ambiguity in
question does not arise. A salient feature of this form is the presence of
phase functionals. The present paper thus introduces a new class of
modifications characterized by this desirable and rare property.
