Representation of Joint Measurement in Quantum Mechanics. A Refutation
  of Quantum Teleportation
An inconsistency is pointed out within Quantum Mechanics as soon as
successive joint measurements are involved on entangled states. The resolution
of the inconsistency leads to a refutation of the use of entangled states as
eigenvectors. Hence, the concept of quantum teleportation, which is based on
the use of such entangled states--the Bell states--as eigenvectors, is
demonstrated to be irrelevant to Quantum Mechanics.
