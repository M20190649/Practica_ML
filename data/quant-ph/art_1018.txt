The Hydrogen Atom as an Entangled Electron-Proton System
We illustrate the description of correlated subsystems by studying the simple
two-body Hydrogen atom. We study the entanglement of the electron and proton
coordinates in the exact analytical solution. This entanglement, which we
quantify in the framework of the density matrix formalism, describes
correlations in the electron-proton motion.
