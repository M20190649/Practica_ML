Lorentz transformations of open systems
We consider open dynamical systems, subject to external interventions by
agents that are not completely described by the theory (classical or quantal).
These interventions are localized in regions that are relatively spacelike.
Under these circumstances, no relativistic transformation law exists that
relates the descriptions of the physical system by observers in relative
motion. Still, physical laws are the same in all Lorentz frames.
