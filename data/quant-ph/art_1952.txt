Two definitions of the electric polarizability of a bound system in
  relativistic quantum theory
For the electric polarizability of a bound system in relativistic quantum
theory, there are two definitions that have appeared in the literature. They
differ depending on whether or not the vacuum background is included in the
system. A recent confusion in this connection is clarified.
