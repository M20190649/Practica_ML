A classical perspective on nonlocality in quantum field theory
A classical statistical field theory hidden variable model for the quantized
Klein-Gordon model is constructed that preserves relativistic signal locality
and is relativistically covariant, but is at the same time relativistically
nonlocal, paralleling the Hegerfeldt nonlocality of quantum theory. It is
argued that the relativistic nonlocality of this model is acceptable to
classical physics, but in any case the approach taken here characterizes the
nonlocality of the quantized Klein-Gordon model in terms of concepts from
classical statistical field theory.
