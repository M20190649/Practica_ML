Understanding the quantum Zeno effect
The quantum Zeno effect consists in the hindrance of the evolution of a
quantum system that is very frequently monitored and found to be in its initial
state at every single measurement. On the basis of the correct formula for the
survival probability, i.e. the probability of finding the system in its initial
state at every single measurement, we critically analyze a recent proposal and
experimental test, that make use of an oscillating system.
