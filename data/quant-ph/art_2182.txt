About Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (by E.Schrodinger)
The original Schrodinger's paper is translated and annotated in honour of the
70-th anniversary of his Uncertainty Relation [published also in: Bulg. Journal
of Physics,vol.26,no.5/6 (1999) pp.193-203]. In the annotation it is shown that
the Uncertainty Relation can be written in a complete compact canonical form.
