Symmetric photon-photon coupling by atoms with Zeeman-split sublevels
We propose a simple scheme for highly efficient nonlinear interaction between
two weak optical fields. The scheme is based on the attainment of
electromagnetically induced transparency simultaneously for both fields via
transitions between magnetically split F=1 atomic sublevels, in the presence of
two driving fields. Thereby, equal slow group velocities and symmetric
cross-coupling of the weak fields over long distances are achieved. By simply
tuning the fields, this scheme can either yield giant cross-phase modulation or
ultrasensitive two-photon switching.
