Photonic Entanglement for Fundamental Tests and Quantum Communication
Entanglement is at the heart of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics like
tests of Bell-inequalities and, as discovered lately, of quantum computation
and communication. Their technological advance made entangled photons play an
outstanding role in entanglement physics. We give a generalized concept of
qubit entanglement and review the state of the art of photonic experiments.
