Green's Function of the Relativistic Coulomb System via Duru-Kleinert
  Method
In this paper the fixed-energy amplitude (Green's function) of the
relativistic Coulomb system is solved by Duru-Kleinert (DK) method. In the
course of the calculations we observe an equivalence between the relativistic
Coulomb system and a radial oscillator.
