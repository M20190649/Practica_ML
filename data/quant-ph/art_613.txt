Comment on ``Protective measurements of the wave function of a single
  squeezed harmonic-oscillator state''
Alter and Yamamoto [Phys. Rev. A 53, R2911 (1996)] claimed to consider
``protective measurements'' [Phys. Lett. A 178, 38 (1993)] which we have
recently introduced. We show that the measurements discussed by Alter and
Yamamoto ``are not'' the protective measurements we proposed. Therefore, their
results are irrelevant to the nature of protective measurements.
