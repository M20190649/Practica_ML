Quantum tunneling with dissipation in smoothly joined parabolic
  potential
This paper is devoted to the study of quantum dissipation in cluster decay
phenomena in the frame of the Lindblad approach to quantum open systems. The
tunneling of a metastable state across a piecewise quadratic potential is
envisaged for two cases : one and two harmonic wells smoothly joined to an
inverted parabola which simulates the barrier. The width and depth of the
second harmonic oscillator well was varied over a wide range of values in order
to encompass particular cases of tunneling such as the double well potential
and the cluster decay. The evolution of the averages and covariances of the
quantum sub-system is studied in both under- and overdamped regimes. For a
gaussian intial wave-packet we compute the tunneling probability for different
values of the friction coefficient and fixed values of the diffusion
coefficients.
