Static Quantum Computation
Tailoring many-body interactions among a proper quantum system endows it with
computing ability by means of static quantum computation in the sense that some
of the physical degrees of freedom can be used to store binary information and
the corresponding binary variables satisfy some given logic relations if and
only if the system is in the ground state. Two theorems are proved showing that
the universal static quantum computer can encode the solutions for any P and NP
problem into its ground state using only polynomial number (in the problem
input size) of logic gates. The second step is to read out the solutions by
relaxing the system. The time complexity is relevant when one tries to read out
the solution by relaxing the system, therefore our model of static quantum
computation provides a new connection between the computational complexity and
the dynamics of a complex system.
