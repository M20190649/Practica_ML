Spontaneous Fermion Production by a Supercritical Potential Well
A second quantised theory of electrons and positrons in a deep time-dependent
potential well is discussed. It is shown that positron production from the well
is a natural consequence of Dirac's hole theory when the strength of the well
becomes supercritical. A formalism is developed whereby the amplitude for
emission of a positron of a given momentum can be calculated. The difference
between positron production and electron-positron pair production is
demonstrated. Considerations of the vacuum charge and of Levinson's theorem are
required for a full description of the problem.
