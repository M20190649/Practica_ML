Quantum identification system
A secure quantum identification system combining a classical identification
procedure and quantum key distribution is proposed. Each identification
sequence is always used just once and new sequences are ``refuelled'' from a
shared provably secret key transferred through the quantum channel. Two
identification protocols are devised. The first protocol can be applied when
legitimate users have an unjammable public channel at their disposal. The
deception probability is derived for the case of a noisy quantum channel. The
second protocol employs unconditionally secure authentication of information
sent over the public channel, and thus it can be applied even in the case when
an adversary is allowed to modify public communications. An experimental
realization of a quantum identification system is described.
