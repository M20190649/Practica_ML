Recovering coherence from decoherence: a method of quantum state
  reconstruction
We present a feasible scheme for reconstructing the quantum state of a field
prepared inside a lossy cavity. Quantum coherences are normally destroyed by
dissipation, but we show that at zero temperature we are able to retrieve
enough information about the initial state, making possible to recover its
Wigner function as well as other quasiprobabilities. We provide a numerical
simulation of a Schroedinger cat state reconstruction.
