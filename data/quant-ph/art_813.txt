Quantum State Reduction and the Quantum Bayes Principle
This paper gives new foundations of quantum state reduction without appealing
to the projection postulate for the probe measurement. For this purpose, the
quantum Bayes principle is formulated as the most fundamental principle for
determining the state of a quantum system, and the joint probability
distribution for the outcomes of local successive measurements on a
noninteracting entangled system is derived without assuming the projection
postulate.
