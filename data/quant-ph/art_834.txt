Can absolute freedom save quantum mechanics?
A classical system violating the Bell inequality is discussed. The system is
local, deterministic, observers have free will, and detectors are ideal so that
no data are lost. The trick is based on two elements. First, a state of one
observer is locally influenced by a "particle". Second, random variables used
in the experiment are complementary. A relation of this effect to nonlocality
is discussed.
