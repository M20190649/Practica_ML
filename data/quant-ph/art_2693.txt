Generalized equation of relativistic quantum mechanics in a gauge field
We develop an unified algebraic approach to the description of gauge
interactions within the framework of a new concept of quantum mechanics. The
next step in generalizing the space-time and the action vector space is made.
The gauge field is defined through linear mappings in the generalized
space-time and the action space. Relativistic quantum mechanics equations for
particles in a gauge field are derived from the structure equations for the
action space expanded in the linear mappings of action vectors. In a special
case, these equations are reduced to the relativistic equations for the leptons
in the electroweak field. As against the standard Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model,
the set of equations includes the equation for the right neutrino interacting
only with the weak Z-field.
