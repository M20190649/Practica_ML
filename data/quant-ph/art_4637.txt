Quantum Measurement of a Single Spin using Magnetic Resonance Force
  Microscopy
Single-spin detection is one of the important challenges facing the
development of several new technologies, e.g. single-spin transistors and
solid-state quantum computation. Magnetic resonance force microscopy with a
cyclic adiabatic inversion, which utilizes a cantilever oscillations driven by
a single spin, is a promising technique to solve this problem. We have studied
the quantum dynamics of a single spin interacting with a quasiclassical
cantilever. It was found that in a similar fashion to the Stern-Gerlach
interferometer the quantum dynamics generates a quantum superposition of two
quasiclassical trajectories of the cantilever which are related to the two spin
projections on the direction of the effective magnetic field in the rotating
reference frame. Our results show that quantum jumps will not prevent a
single-spin measurement if the coupling between the cantilever vibrations and
the spin is small in comparison with the amplitude of the radio-frequency
external field.
