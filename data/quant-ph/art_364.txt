Generalized Moyal structures in phase space, kinetic equations and their
  classical limit: II. Applications to harmonic oscillator models
The formalism of generalized Wigner transformations developped in a previous
paper, is applied to kinetic equations of the Lindblad type for quantum
harmonic oscillator models. It is first applied to an oscillator coupled to an
equilibrium chain of other oscillators having nearest-neighbour interactions.
The kinetic equation is derived without using the so called rotating-wave
approximation. Then it is shown that the classical limit of the corresponding
phase-space equation is independent of the ordering of operators corresponding
to the inverse of the generalized Wigner transformation, provided the latter is
involutive. Moreover, this limit equation, which conserves the probabilistic
nature of the distribution function and obeys an H-theorem, coincides with the
kinetic equation for the corresponding classical system, which is derived
independently and is distinct from that usually obtained in the litterature and
not sharing the above properties. Finally the same formalism is applied to more
general model equations used in quantum optics and it is shown that the above
results remain unaltered.
