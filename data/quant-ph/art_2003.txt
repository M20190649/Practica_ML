Phase space formalisms of quantum mechanics with singular kernel
The equivalence of the Rivier-Margenau-Hill and Born-Jordan-Shankara phase
space formalisms to the conventional operator approach of quantum mechanics is
demonstrated. It is shown that in spite of the presence of singular kernels the
mappings relating phase space functions and operators back and forth are
possible.
