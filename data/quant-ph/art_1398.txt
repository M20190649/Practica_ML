Exact boundary conditions at finite distance for the time-dependent
  Schrodinger equation
Exact boundary conditions at finite distance for the solutions of the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation are derived. A numerical scheme based on
Crank-Nicholson method is proposed to illustrate its applicability in several
examples.
