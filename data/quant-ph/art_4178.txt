Rigid rotor in phase space
Angular momentum is important concept in physics, and its phase space
properties are important in various applications. In this work phase space
analysis of the angular momentum is made from its classical definition, and by
imposing uncertainty principle its quantum properties are obtained. It is shown
that kinetic energy operator is derived, but it has different interpretation of
its parts than in the standard treatment. Rigid rotor is discussed and it is
shown what is its phase space representation. True rigid rotor is defined and
also its phase space properties are discussed.
