Construction of a Scalable, Uniform and Universal Quantum Network and
  Its Applications
We present a possible candidate of construction of a scalable, uniform and
universal quantum network, which is built from quantum gates to elements of
quantum circuit, again to quantum subnetworks and finally to an entire quantum
network. Our scheme can overcome some difficulties of the existing schemes and
makes improvements to different extent in the scale of quantum network, ability
of computation, implementation of engineering, efficiency of quantum network,
universality, compatibility, design principle, programmability, fault
tolerance, error control, industrialization and commercialization {\it et. al}
aspects. As the applications of this construction scheme, we obtain the entire
quantum networks for Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm and solving
Schr\"odinger equation in general. This implies that the scalable, uniform and
universal quantum networks are able to generally describe the known main
results and can be further applied to more interesting examples in quantum
computations.
