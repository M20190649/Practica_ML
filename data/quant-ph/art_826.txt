A simple quantum channel having superadditivity of channel capacity
When classical information is sent through a quantum channel of nonorthogonal
states, there is a possibility that transmittable classical information exceeds
a channel capacity in a single use of the initial channel by extending it into
multi-product channel. In this paper, it is shown that this remarkable feature
of a quantum channel, so-called superadditivity, appears even in as low as the
third extended coding of the simplest binary input channel. A physical
implementation of this channel is indicated based on cavity QED techniques.
