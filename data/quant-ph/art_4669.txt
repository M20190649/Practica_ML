Entanglement purification with noisy apparatus can be used to factor out
  an eavesdropper
We give a proof that entanglement purification, even with noisy apparatus, is
sufficient to disentangle an eavesdropper (Eve) from the communication channel.
Our proof applies to all possible attacks (individual and coherent). Due to the
quantum nature of the entanglement purification protocol, it is also possible
to use the obtained quantum channel for secure transmission of quantum
information.
