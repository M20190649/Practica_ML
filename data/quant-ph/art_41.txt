Intrinsic and operational observables in quantum mechanics
The concept of intrinsic and operational observables in quantum mechanics is
introduced. In any realistic description of a quantum measurement that includes
a macroscopic detecting device, it is possible to construct from the statistics
of the recorded raw data a set of operational quantities that correspond to the
intrinsic quantum mechanical observable.
