A unified (classical-quantum-statistical) formalism for continuous
  spectrum systems
A unified (classical-quantum-statistical) formalism for a system with
continuous spectrum is introduced. For this kind of systems ergodicity behavior
and the existence of microcanonical and canonical (KMS) equilibrium is proved.
It is argued that the continuous spectrum condition is essential for the
thermodynamical behavior
