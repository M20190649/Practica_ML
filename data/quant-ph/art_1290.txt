Quantum state sensitivity to initial conditions
The different time-dependent distances of two arbitrarily close quantum or
classical-statistical states to a third fixed state are shown to imply an
experimentally relevant notion of state sensitivity to initial conditions. A
quantitative classification scheme of quantum states by their sensitivity and
instability in state space is given that reduces to the one performed by
classical-mechanical Lyapunov exponents in the classical limit
