Squeezed States and Helmholtz Spectra
The 'classical interpretation' of the wave function psi(x) reveals an
interesting operational aspect of the Helmholtz spectra. It is shown that the
traditional Sturm-Liouville problem contains the simplest key to predict the
squeezing effect for charged particle states.
