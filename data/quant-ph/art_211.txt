The von Neumann-Wigner type potentials and the wave functions'
  asymptotics for the discrete levels in continuum
One to one correspondence between the decay law of the von Neumann-Wigner
type potentials and the asymptotic behaviour of the wave functions representing
bound states in the continuum is established.
