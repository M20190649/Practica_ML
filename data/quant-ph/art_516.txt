Negative Binomial States of Quantized Radiation Fields
We introduce the negative binomial states with negative binomial distribution
as their photon number distribution. They reduce to the ordinary coherent
states and Susskind-Glogower phase states in different limits. The ladder and
displacement operator formalisms are found and they are essentially the
Perelomov's su(1,1) coherent states via its Holstein-Primakoff realisation.
These states exhibit strong squeezing effect and they obey the super-Poissonian
statistics. A method to generate these states is proposed.
