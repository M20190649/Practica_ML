Laser Cooling of two trapped ions: Sideband cooling beyond the
  Lamb-Dicke limit
We study laser cooling of two ions that are trapped in a harmonic potential
and interact by Coulomb repulsion. Sideband cooling in the Lamb-Dicke regime is
shown to work analogously to sideband cooling of a single ion. Outside the
Lamb-Dicke regime, the incommensurable frequencies of the two vibrational modes
result in a quasi-continuous energy spectrum that significantly alters the
cooling dynamics. The cooling time decreases nonlinearly with the linewidth of
the cooling transition, and the effect of trapping states which may slow down
the cooling is considerably reduced. We show that cooling to the ground state
is possible also outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We develop the model and use
Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for specific examples. We show that a rate
equation treatment is a good approximation in all cases.
