Comment on "Quantum Theory of Dispersive Electromagnetic Fields"
Recently Drummond and Hillery [Phys. Rev.A 59, 691(1999)] presented a quantum
theory of dispersion based on the analysis of a coupled system of the
electromagnetic field and atoms in the multipolar QED formulation. The theory
has led to the explicit mode-expansions for various field-operators in a
homogeneous medium characterized by an arbitrary number of resonant transitions
with different frequencies. In this Comment, we drawn attention to a similar
multipolar study by Juzeliunas [Phys. Rev.A 53, 3543 (1996); 55, 929 (1997)] on
the field quantization in a discrete molecular (or atomic) medium. A
comparative analysis of the two approaches is carried out, highlighting both
common and distinctive features.
