Invariant Polynomial Functions on k qudits
We study the polynomial functions on tensor states in $(C^n)^{\otimes k}$
which are invariant under $SU(n)^k$. We describe the space of invariant
polynomials in terms of symmetric group representations. For $k$ even, the
smallest degree for invariant polynomials is $n$ and in degree $n$ we find a
natural generalization of the determinant. For $n,d$ fixed, we describe the
asymptotic behavior of the dimension of the space of invariants as
$k\to\infty$. We study in detail the space of homogeneous degree 4 invariant
polynomial functions on $(C^2)^{\otimes k}$.
