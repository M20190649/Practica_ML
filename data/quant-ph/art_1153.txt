All bound states of NO_2 (J=0)
We calculated all 2967 even and odd bound states of the adiabatic ground
state of NO_2, using a modification of the ab initio potential energy surface
of Leonardi et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 105, 9051 (1996)]. The calculation was
performed by harmonic inversion of the Chebyshev correlation function generated
by a DVR Hamiltonian in Radau coordinates. The relative error for the computed
eigenenergies is $10^{-4}$ or better. Near the dissociation threshold the
density of states is about 0.3cm$^{-1}$. Statistical analysis of the states
shows some interesting structure of the rigidity parameter $\Delta_3$ as a
function of energy.
