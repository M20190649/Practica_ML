Coloring the rational quantum sphere and the Kochen-Specker theorem
We review and extend recent findings of Godsil and Zaks, who published a
constructive coloring of the rational unit sphere with the property that for
any orthogonal tripod formed by rays extending from the origin of the points of
the sphere, exactly one ray is red, white and black. They also showed that any
consistent coloring of the real sphere requires an additional color. We discuss
some of the consequences for the Kochen-Specker theorem.
