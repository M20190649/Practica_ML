Violations of local realism by two entangled quNits are stronger than
  for two qubits
Tests of local realism vs quantum mechanics based on Bell's inequality employ
two entangled qubits. We investigate the general case of two entangled quNits,
i.e. quantum systems defined in an N-dimensional Hilbert space. Via a numerical
linear optimization method we show that violations of local realism are
stronger for two maximally entangled quNits (N=3,4,...,9), than for two qubits
and that they increase with N. The two quNit measurements can be experimentally
realized using entangled photons and unbiased multiport beamsplitters.
