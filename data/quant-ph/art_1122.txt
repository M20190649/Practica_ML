Strictly isospectral supersymmetry and Schroedinger general zero modes
The connection between the strictly isospectral construction in
supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the general zero mode solutions of the
Schroedinger equation is explained by introducing slightly generalized
first-order intertwining operators. We also present a multiple-parameter
generalization of the strictly isospectral construction in the same perspective
