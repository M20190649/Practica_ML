Branching Space-time analysis of the GHZ theorem
Greenberger, Horne, Shimony and Zeilinger gave a new version of the Bell
theorem without using inequalities (probabilities). Mermin summarized it
concisely; but Bohm and Hiley criticized Mermin's proof from contextualists'
point of view.
  Using the Branching Space-time language, in this paper a proof will be given
that is free of these difficulties. At the same time we will also clarify the
limits of the validity of the theorem when it is taken as a proof that quantum
mechanics is not compatible with a deterministic world nor with a world that
permits correlated space-related events without a common cause.
