Generalized intelligent states and SU(1,1) and SU(2) squeezing
A sufficient condition for a state |\psi> to minimize the
Robertson-Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relation for two observables A and B is
obtained which for A with no discrete spectrum is also a necessary one. Such
states, called generalized intelligent states (GIS), exhibit arbitrarily strong
squeezing (after Eberly) of A and B. Systems of GIS for the SU(1,1) and SU(2)
groups are constructed and discussed. It is shown that SU(1,1) GIS contain all
the Perelomov coherent states (CS) and the Barut and Girardello CS while the
Bloch CS are subset of SU(2) GIS.
