Implementation of a Deutsch-like quantum algorithm utilizing
  entanglement at the two-qubit level, on an NMR quantum information processor
We describe the experimental implementation of a recently proposed quantum
algorithm involving quantum entanglement at the level of two qubits using NMR.
The algorithm solves a generalisation of the Deutsch problem and distinguishes
between even and odd functions using fewer function calls than is possible
classically. The manipulation of entangled states of the two qubits is
essential here, unlike the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Grover's search
algorithm for two bits.
