Quantum chaos in an ion trap: the delta-kicked harmonic oscillator
We propose an experimental configuration, within an ion trap, by which a
quantum mechanical delta-kicked harmonic oscillator could be realized, and
investigated. We show how to directly measure the sensitivity of the ion motion
to small variations in the external parameters.
