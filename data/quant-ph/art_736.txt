Entanglement of a Pair of Quantum Bits
The ``entanglement of formation'' of a mixed state of a bipartite quantum
system can be defined in terms of the number of pure singlets needed to create
the state with no further transfer of quantum information. We find an exact
formula for the entanglement of formation for all mixed states of two qubits
having no more than two non-zero eigenvalues, and we report evidence suggesting
that the formula is valid for all states of this system.
