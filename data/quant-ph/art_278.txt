Protective Measurements of Two-State Vectors
A recent result about measurability of a quantum state of a single quantum
system is generalized to the case of a single pre- and post-selected quantum
system described by a two-state vector. The protection required for such
measurement is achieved by coupling the quantum system to a pre- and
post-selected protected device yielding a nonhermitian effective Hamiltonian.
