Quantum Oscillator with Kronig-Penney Excitation in Different Regimes of
  Damping
There are discussed the exact solution of the time--dependent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for a damped quantum oscillator subject to a periodical frequency
delta--kicks describing squeezed states which are expressed in terms of
Chebyshev polynomials. The cases of strong and weak damping are investigated in
the frame of Caldirola--Kanai model.
