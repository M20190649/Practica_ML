Quantum Mechanics in Terms of Realism
.We expound an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation of the formalism
of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The basic difference is that the new
interpretation is formulated in the language of epistemological realism. The
{\psi} function is no longer interpreted as a probability amplitude of the
observed behaviour of elementary particles but as an objective physical field
representing the particles themselves. The particles are thus extended objects
whose extension varies in time according to the variation of {\psi}. They are
considered as fundamental regions of space with some kind of nonlocality. There
is no wave-particle duality. The point-particle-like behaviour is explained by
spatial contraction in a deterministic reduction process.
