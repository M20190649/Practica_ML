Two-atom dark states in electromagnetic cavities
The center-of-mass motion of two two-level atoms coupled to a single damped
mode of an electromagnetic resonator is investigated. For the case of one atom
being initially excited and the cavity mode in the vacuum state it is shown
that the atomic time evolution is dominated by the appearance of dark states.
These states, in which the initial excitation is stored in the internal atomic
degrees of freedom and the atoms become quantum mechanically entangled, are
almost immune against photon loss from the cavity. Various properties of the
dark states within and beyond the Raman-Nath approximation of atom optics are
worked out.
