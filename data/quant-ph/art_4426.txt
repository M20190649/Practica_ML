Towards a Simulation of Quantum Computers by Classical Systems
We present a two-dimensional classical stochastic differential equation for a
displacement field of a point particle in two dimensions and show that its
components define real and imaginary parts of a complex field satisfying the
Schroedinger equation of a harmonic oscillator. In this way we derive the
discrete oscillator spectrum from classical dynamics. The model is then
generalized to an arbitrary potential. This opens up the possibility of
efficiently simulating quantum computers with the help of classical systems.
