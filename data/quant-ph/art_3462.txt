Direct sampling of exponential phase moments of smoothed Wigner
  functions
We investigate exponential phase moments of the s-parametrized
quasidistributions (smoothed Wigner functions). We show that the knowledge of
these moments as functions of s provides, together with photon-number
statistics, a complete description of the quantum state. We demonstrate that
the exponential phase moments can be directly sampled from the data recorded in
balanced homodyne detection and we present simple expressions for the sampling
kernels. The phase moments are Fourier coefficients of phase distributions
obtained from the quasidistributions via integration over the radial variable
in polar coordinates. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the homodyne
detection and we demonstrate the feasibility of direct sampling of the moments
and subsequent reconstruction of the phase distribution.
