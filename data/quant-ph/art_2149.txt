Generation of entanglement in a system of two dipole-interacting atoms
  by means of laser pulses
Effectiveness of using laser field to produce entanglement between two
dipole-interacting identical two-level atoms is considered in detail. The
entanglement is achieved by driving the system with a carefully designed laser
pulse transferring the system's population to one of the maximally entangled
Dicke states in a way analogous to population inversion by a resonant
$\pi$-pulse in a two-level atom. It is shown that for the optimally chosen
pulse frequency, power and duration, the fidelity of generating a maximally
entangled state approaches unity as the distance between the atoms goes to
zero.
