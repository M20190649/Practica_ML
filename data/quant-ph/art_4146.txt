Stochastic Noise as a Source of Decoherence in a Solid State Quantum
  Computer
We examine a stochastic noise process that has a decohering effect on the
average evolution of qubits in the quantum register of the solid state quantum
computer proposed by Kane. We consider the effects of this process on the
single qubit operations necessary to perform quantum logical gates and derive
an expression for the fidelity of these gates in this system. We then calculate
an upper bound on the level of this stochastic noise tolerable in a workable
quantum computer.
