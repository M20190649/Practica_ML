Characteristic times in one dimensional scattering
This chapter reviews several quantities that have been proposed in scattering
theory to characterize the temporal aspects of one dimensional collisions: the
dwell time, the delay time, the decay time, and times characterizing transient
effects or the attainment of stationary conditions. Some aspects of tunnelling
times are also discussed.
