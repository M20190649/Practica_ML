Tomography and spectroscopy as quantum computations
Determining the state of a system and measuring properties of its evolution
are two of the most important tasks a physicist faces. For the first purpose
one can use tomography, a method that after subjecting the system to a number
of experiments determines all independent elements of the density matrix. For
the second task, one can resort to spectroscopy, a set of techniques used to
determine the spectrum of eigenvalues of the evolution operator. In this
letter, we show that tomography and spectroscopy can be naturally interpreted
as dual forms of quantum computation. We show how to adapt the simplest case of
the well-known phase estimation quantum algorithm to perform both tasks, giving
it a natural interpretation as a simulated scattering experiment. We show how
this algorithm can be used to implement an interesting form of tomography by
performing a direct measurement of the Wigner function of a quantum system. We
present results of such measurements performed on a system of three qubits
using liquid state NMR quantum computation techniques in a sample of
trichloroethylene. Remarkable analogies with other experiments are discussed.
