Reducing decoherence in quantum computer memory with all quantum bits
  coupling to the same environment
Decoherence in quantum computer memory due to the inevitable coupling to the
external environment is examined. We take the assumption that all quantum bits
(qubits) interact with the same environment rather than the assumption of
separate environments for different qubits. It is found that the qubits are
decohered collectively. For some kinds of entangled input states, no
decoherence occurs at all in the memory even if the qubits are interacting with
the environment. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme is proposed for reducing
the collective decoherence. We also discuss possible implications of this
decoherence model for quantum measurements.
