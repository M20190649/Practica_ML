Reversible quantum operations and their application to teleportation
Quantum operations provide a general description of the state changes allowed
by quantum mechanics. Simple necessary and sufficient conditions for an ideal
quantum operation to be reversible by a unitary operation are derived in this
paper. These results generalize recent work on reversible measurements by
Mabuchi and Zoller [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 3108 (1996)]. Quantum
teleportation can be understood as a special case of the problem of reversing
quantum operations. We characterize completely teleportation schemes of the
type proposed by Bennett {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70}, 1895 (1993)].
