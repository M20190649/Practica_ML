TelePOVM -- New Faces of Teleportation
We show two new aspects of teleportation based on generalized measurements:
I. We present an alternative approach to teleportation based on ``generating
$\rho$-ensembles at spacetime separation''; This approach provides a better
understanding of teleportation. II. We define the concept of {\em conclusive
teleportation} and we show how to teleport a quantum state using any pure
entangled state; we show how to use the conclusive teleportation as a criterion
for non-locality.
