Supersymmetric features of the Maxwell fish-eye lens
We provide a supersymmetric analysis of the Maxwell fisheye (MF) wave problem
at zero energy. Working in the so-called $R_{0}=0$ sector, we obtain the
corresponding superpartner (fermionic) MF effective potential within Witten's
one-dimensional (radial) supersymmetric procedure.
