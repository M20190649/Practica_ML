Generating Entangled Two-Photon States with Coincident Frequencies
It is shown that parametric downconversion, with a short-duration pump pulse
and a long nonlinear crystal that is appropriately phase matched, can produce a
frequency-entangled biphoton state whose individual photons are coincident in
frequency. Quantum interference experiments which distinguish this state from
the familiar time-coincident biphoton state are described.
