Quantum Information Processing with Microfabricated Optical Elements
We discuss a new direction in the field of quantum information processing
with neutral atoms. It is based on the use of microfabricated optical elements.
With these elements versatile and integrated atom optical devices can be
created in a compact fashion. This approach opens the possibility to scale,
parallelize, and miniaturize atom optics for new investigations in fundamental
research and applications towards quantum computing with neutral atoms. The
exploitation of the unique features of the quantum mechanical behavior of
matter waves and the capabilities of powerful state-of-the-art micro- and
nanofabrication techniques lend this approach a special attraction.
