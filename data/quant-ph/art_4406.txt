`Quantum probabilities' as context depending probabilities
We study transformations of conventional (`classical') probabilities induced
by context transitions. It is demonstrated that the transition from one complex
of conditions to another induces a perturbation of the classical rule for the
addition of probabilistic alternatives. We classify such perturbations. It is
shown that there are two classes of perturbations: (a) trigonometric
interference; (b) hyperbolic interference. In particular, the well known
`quantum interference of probabilistic alternatives' can be obtained in
classical (but contextual) probabilistic framework. Therefore we need not apply
to wave arguments (or consider superposition principle) to get Quantum
Statistics. In particular, interference could be a feature of experiments with
purely corpuscular objects.
