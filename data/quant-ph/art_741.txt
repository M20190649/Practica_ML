On the Nature of Charge Conjugation in Quantum Theory
On the basis of the invariance of Dirac equation Lu(x,c)=0 with respect to
the inversion of the speed of light Q:(x,c)=(x,-c), it is shown that the
relationship [C,PTQ]u(x,c)=0 between the transformations of the charge
conjugation C, the space inversion P, the time reversal T and the inversion of
the speed of light Q is true. The charge conjugation in quantum theory may be
interpreted as the consequence of the discrete symmetries reflecting the
fundamental properties of space, time and speed of light.
