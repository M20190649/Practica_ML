Adiabatic Measurements on Metastable Systems
In several situations, most notably when describing metastable states, a
system can evolve according to an effective non hermitian Hamiltonian. To each
eigenvalue of a non hermitian Hamiltonian is associated an eigenstate
$\vert\phi\rangle$ which evolves forward in time and an eigenstate
$\langle{\psi}\vert$ which evolves backward in time. Quantum measurements on
such systems are analyzed in detail with particular emphasis on adiabatic
measurements in which the measuring device is coupled weakly to the system. It
is shown that in this case the outcome of the measurement of an observable $A$
is the weak value $\langle{\psi}\vert A\vert\phi\rangle /
\langle{\psi}\vert{\phi}\rangle $ associated to the two-state vector
$\langle{\psi}\vert$ $\vert\phi\rangle$ corresponding to one of the eigenvalues
of the non hermitian Hamiltonian. The possibility of performing such
measurements in a laboratory is discussed.
