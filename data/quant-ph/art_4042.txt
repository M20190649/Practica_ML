Functional approach to quantum decoherence and the classical final limit
  II: the pointer basis and the quantum measurements
A quantum system with discrete and continuos evolution spectrum is studied. A
final pointer basis is found, that can be defined in a presised mathematical
way. This result is use to explain the quantum measurement in the system.
