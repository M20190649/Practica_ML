Geometric Phase, Hannay's Angle, and an Exact Action Variable
Canonical structure of a generalized time-periodic harmonic oscillator is
studied by finding the exact action variable (invariant). Hannay's angle is
defined if closed curves of constant action variables return to the same curves
in phase space after a time evolution. The condition for the existence of
Hannay's angle turns out to be identical to that for the existence of a
complete set of (quasi)periodic wave functions. Hannay's angle is calculated,
and it is shown that Berry's relation of semiclassical origin on geometric
phase and Hannay's angle is exact for the cases considered.
