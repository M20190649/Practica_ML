Teleportation Scheme of S-level Quantum Pure States by Two-level EPRs
Unknown quantum pure states of arbitrary but definite S-level of a particle
can be transferred onto a group of remote two-level particles through two-level
EPRs as many as the number of those particles in this group. We construct such
a kind of teleportation, the realization of which need a nonlocal unitary
transformation to the quantum system that is made up of the s-level particle
and all the two-level particles at one end of the EPRs, and measurements to all
the single particles in this system. The unitary transformation to more than
two particles is also written into the product form of two-body unitary
transformations.
