The asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement
We present an analytical formula for the asymptotic relative entropy of
entanglement for Werner states of arbitrary dimension. We then demonstrate its
validity using methods from convex optimization. To our knowledge, this is the
first case in which the value of a subadditive entanglement measure has been
obtained in the asymptotic limit.
