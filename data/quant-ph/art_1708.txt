What is Surrealistic about Bohm Trajectories?
We discuss interferometers in Bohmian quantum mechanics. It is shown that,
with the correct configuration space, Bohm trajectories in a which way
interferometer are not surrealistic, but behaves exactly as common sense
suggests. Some remarks about a way to generalize Bohmian mechanics to treat
density matrix are also made.
