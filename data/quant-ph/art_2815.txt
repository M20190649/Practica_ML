A Topos Perspective on the Kochen-Specker Theorem: III. Von Neumann
  Algebras as the Base Category
We extend the topos-theoretic treatment given in previous papers of assigning
values to quantities in quantum theory, and of related issues such as the
Kochen-Specker theorem. This extension has two main parts: the use of von
Neumann algebras as a base category (Section 2); and the relation of our
generalized valuations to (i) the assignment to quantities of intervals of real
numbers, and (ii) the idea of a subobject of the coarse-graining presheaf
(Section 3).
