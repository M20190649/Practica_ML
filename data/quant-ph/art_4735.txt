Explicit conversion from the Casimir force to Planck's law of radiation
The Casimir force has its origin in finite modification of the infinite
zero-point energy induced by a specific boundary condition for the spatial
configuration. In terms of the imaginary-time formalism at finite temperature,
the root of Planck's law of radiation can be traced back to finite modification
of the infinite vacuum energy induced by the periodic boundary condition in the
temporal direction. We give the explicit conversion from the Casimir force to
Planck's law of radiation, which shows the apparent correspondence between the
system bounded by parallel conducting plates and the thermodynamic system. The
temperature inversion symmetry and the duality relation in the thermodynamics
are also discussed. We conclude that the effective temperature characterized by
the spatial extension should no longer be regarded as genuine temperature.
