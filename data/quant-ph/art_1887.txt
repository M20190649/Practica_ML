Derivation of classical capacity of quantum channel for discrete
  information source
In this letter, we prove that the classical capacity of quantum channel for
$M$ symmetric states is achieved by an uniform distribution on a priori
probabilities. We also investigate non-symmetric cases such as a ternary
amplitude shift keyed signal set and a 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulated
signal set in coherent states.
