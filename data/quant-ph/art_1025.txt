Against Measurement? -- On the Concept of Information
In his last article "Against `Measurement'" J. S. Bell sums up his well known
critique of the problem of explaining the measurement process within the
framework of quantum theory. In this article I will discuss the measurement
process by analysing the concept of measurement from the epistemological point
of view and I will argue against Bell that it belongs to the preconditions of
experience to necessarily end up with a "reduction of the wavefunction". I will
consider the "chain of reduction" in detail -- from pure states of S&A (system
S and measuring apparatus A) via different kinds of mixtures to pure states of
A(S). It turns out that decoherence is not sufficient to explain reduction, but
that this can be done in terms of the concept of information within a
transcendental approach.
