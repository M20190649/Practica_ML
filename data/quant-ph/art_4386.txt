Dissipative quantum theory: Implications for quantum entanglement
Three inter-related topics are discussed here. One, the Lindblad dynamics of
quantum dissipative systems; two, quantum entanglement in composite systems and
its quantification based on the Tsallis entropy; and three, robustness of
entanglement under dissipation. After a brief review of the Lindblad theory of
quantum dissipative systems and the idea of quantum entanglement in composite
quantum systems illustrated by describing the three particle systems, the
behavior of entanglement under the influence of dissipative processes is
discussed. These issues are of importance in the discussion of quantum
nanometric systems of current research.
