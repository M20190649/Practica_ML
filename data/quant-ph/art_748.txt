Simulation of Many-Body Fermi Systems on a Universal Quantum Computer
We provide fast algorithms for simulating many body Fermi systems on a
universal quantum computer. Both first and second quantized descriptions are
considered, and the relative computational complexities are determined in each
case. In order to accommodate fermions using a first quantized Hamiltonian, an
efficient quantum algorithm for anti-symmetrization is given. Finally, a
simulation of the Hubbard model is discussed in detail.
