Quantum noise in ideal operational amplifiers
We consider a model of quantum measurement built on an ideal operational
amplifier operating in the limit of infinite gain, infinite input impedance and
null output impedance and with a feddback loop. We evaluate the intensity and
voltage noises which have to be added to the classical amplification equations
in order to fulfill the requirements of quantum mechanics. We give a
description of this measurement device as a quantum network scattering quantum
fluctuations from input to output ports.
