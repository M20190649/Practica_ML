Symmetrizing The Symmetrization Postulate
Reasonable requirements of (a) physical invariance under particle permutation
and (b) physical completeness of state descriptions, enable us to deduce a
Symmetric Permutation Rule(SPR): that by taking care with our state
descriptions, it is always possible to construct state vectors (or wave
functions) that are purely symmetric under pure permutation for all particles,
regardless of type distinguishability or spin. The conventional exchange
antisymmetry for two identical half-integer spin particles is shown to be due
to a subtle interdependence in the individual state descriptions arising from
an inherent geometrical asymmetry. For three or more such particles, however,
antisymmetrization of the state vector for all pairs simultaneously is shown to
be impossible and the SPR makes observably different predictions, although the
usual pairwise exclusion rules are maintained. The usual caveat of fermion
antisymmetrization - that composite integer spin particles (with fermionic
consitituents) behave only approximately like bosons - is no longer necessary.
