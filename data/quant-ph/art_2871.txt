Time-of-arrival distributions from position-momentum and energy-time
  joint measurements
The position-momentum quasi-distribution obtained from an Arthurs and Kelly
joint measurement model is used to obtain indirectly an ``operational''
time-of-arrival (TOA) distribution following a quantization procedure proposed
by Kocha\'nski and W\'odkiewicz [Phys. Rev. A 60, 2689 (1999)]. This TOA
distribution is not time covariant. The procedure is generalized by using other
phase-space quasi-distributions, and sufficient conditions are provided for
time covariance that limit the possible phase-space quasi-distributions
essentially to the Wigner function, which, however, provides a non-positive TOA
quasi-distribution. These problems are remedied with a different quantization
procedure which, on the other hand, does not guarantee normalization. Finally
an Arthurs and Kelly measurement model for TOA and energy (valid also for
arbitrary conjugate variables when one of the variables is bounded from below)
is worked out. The marginal TOA distribution so obtained, a distorted version
of Kijowski's distribution, is time covariant, positive, and normalized.
