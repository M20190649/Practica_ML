Quantum subroutine problem and the robustness of quantum complexity
  classes
This paper positively solves the quantum subroutine problem for fully quantum
oracles. The quantum subroutine problem asks whether a quantum computer with an
efficiently computable oracle can be efficiently simulated by a non-oracle
quantum computer. We extends the earlier results obtained by Bennett,
Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani, and by Aharonov, Kitaev, and Nisan to the
case where the oracle evaluates a unitary operator and the computer is allowed
to be in the superposition of a query state and a non-query state during
computation. We also prove the robustness of {\bf EQP}, {\bf BQP}, and {\bf
ZQP} under the above general formulation, extending the earlier results on the
robustness of {\bf BQP} shown by Bennett et al.
