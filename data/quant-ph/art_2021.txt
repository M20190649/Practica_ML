Quantum Key Distribution: from Principles to Practicalities
We review the main protocols for key distribution based on principles of
quantum mechanics, describing the general underlying ideas, discussing
implementation requirements and pointing out directions of current experiments.
The issue of security is addressed both from a principal and real-life point of
view.
