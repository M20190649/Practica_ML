Primal structure of Quantum Mechanics - A critique and an alternative
The basic premise of Quantum Mechanics, embodied in the doctrine of
wave-particle duality, assigns both, a particle and a wave structure to the
physical entities. The classical laws describing the motion of a particle and
the evolution of a wave are assumed to be correct. Gauge Mechanics treats the
discrete entities as particles, and their motion is described by an extension
of the corresponding classical laws. Quantum mechanical interpretations of
various observations and their implications, including some issues that are
usually ignored, are presented and compared here with the gauge mechanical
descriptions. The considerations are confined mainly to the conceptual
foundations and the internal consistency of these theories. Although no major
differences between their predictions have yet been noticed, some deviations
are expected, which are indicated. These cases may provide the testing grounds
for further investigations.
