Space Structure and Quantum Mechanics
A new concept of the constitution of Nature is proposed. The constructed
submicroscopic quantum mechanics is deterministic and is characterised by
elementary excitations of the space net that is treated as the tessellation of
balls, or superparticles. Said excitations called "inertons" accompany any
canonical particle when it moves. It is shown theoretically that the
introduction of inertons obviates all conceptual difficulties of orthodox
quantum mechanics. The theory has been verified experimentally. It is argued
that just inertons play the role of real carriers in the gravitational
interaction.
