Teleportation with the entangled states of a beam splitter
We present a teleportation protocol based upon the entanglement produced from
Fock states incident onto a beam splitter of arbitrary transmissivity. The
teleportation fidelity is analysed, its trends being explained from
consideration of a beam splitter's input/output characteristics.
