Delocalized Qubits as a Computational Basis in the System of Interacting
  Spins
It is suggested to map the qubits into solid state NMR spin system collective
states instead of the states of the individual spin. Such an approach
introduces the stable computational basis without any additional actions and
allows to obtain the universal set of quantum gates, which operation time is
determined only by a RF pulse duration.
