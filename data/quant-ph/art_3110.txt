Controlling Decoherence in Bose-Einstein Condensation by Light
  Scattering far off Resonance
It is shown that, through a super-radiant Rayleigh scattering, a strong far
off-resonant pump laser applied to a Bose-Einstein condensates(BEC) can induce
a non-demolition coupling of the many-mode quantized vacuum field to the BEC.
This effective interaction will force the total system of the BEC plus the
light field to evolve from a factorized initial state to an ideal entangled
state and thus result in the quantum decoherence in the BEC. Since the
effective coupling coefficients are mainly determined by the Rabi frequency of
the pump laser, the quantum decoherence process can be controlled by adjusting
the intensity of the pump laser. To study the physical influence of decoherence
on the BEC, we investigate how the coherent tunneling of BEC in a
well-separated tight double wall is suppressed by the effectively-entangled
vacuum modes.
