Casimir Effect - The Classical Limit
The temperature dependence of the Casimir effect for the radiation field
confined between two conducting plates is analysed. The Casimir energy is shown
to decline exponentially with temperature while the Casimir entropy which is
defined in the text is shown to approach a limit which depends only on the
geometry of the constraining plates. The results are discussed in terms of the
relation between the Bose distribution function and the equipartition theorem -
a relation based on a study by Einstein and Stern circa 1913.
