Partial Teleportation of Entanglement in the Noisy Environment
Partial teleportation of entanglement is to teleport one particle of an
entangled pair through a quantum channel. This is conceptually equivalent to
quantum swapping. We consider the partial teleportation of entanglement in the
noisy environment, employing the Werner-state representation of the noisy
channel for the simplicity of calculation. To have the insight of the many-body
teleportation, we introduce the measure of correlation information and study
the transfer of the correlation information and entanglement. We find that the
fidelity gets smaller as the initial-state is entangled more for a given
entanglement of the quantum channel. The entangled channel transfers at least
some of the entanglement to the final state.
