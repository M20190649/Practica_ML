Separability of Mixed States: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of mixed
states. As a result we obtain a simple criterion of separability for $2\times2$
and $2\times3$ systems. Here, the positivity of the partial transposition of a
state is necessary and sufficient for its separability. However, it is not the
case in general. Some examples of mixtures which demonstrate the utility of the
criterion are considered.
