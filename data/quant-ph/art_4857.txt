Classical Communication via the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Channel Alone: A
  Proposed Experimental Test
We uncover an apparent instance of classical information transfer via only
the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channel in a quantum optical protocol between Alice
and Bob, involving two-photon maximal path entanglement and based on a recent
Innsbruck experiment. The signal is traced to the appearance of coherent
reduction due to the onset of spatial degeneracy in the eigenvalue spectrum for
Alice's measurement. We present our result primarily as an issue for
experimental testing rather than as a definitive prediction at this stage.
