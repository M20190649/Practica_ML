Numerical Constructions of Perturbation Series in Quantum Mechanics
A few modified textbook Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbative representations
of bound states are reviewed. They were all inspired by an adaptive re-split of
the Hamiltonian, using nonstandard bases and the flexibility of normalization
of the wave functions.
