Quantum damping of position due to energy measurements
Quantum theory for measurements of energy is introduced and its consequences
for the average position of monitored dynamical systems are analyzed. It turns
out that energy measurements lead to a localization of the expectation values
of other observables. This is manifested, in the case of position, as a damping
of the motion without classical analogue. Quantum damping of position for an
atom bouncing on a reflecting surface in presence of a homogeneous
gravitational field is dealt in detail and the connection with an experiment
already performed in the classical regime is studied. We show that quantum
damping is testable provided that the same measurement strength obtained in the
experimental verification of the quantum Zeno effect in atomic spectroscopy [W.
