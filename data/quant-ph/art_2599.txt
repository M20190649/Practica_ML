Limits for entanglement measures
We show that {\it any} entanglement measure $E$ suitable for the regime of
high number of entangled pairs satisfies $E_D\leq E\leq E_F$ where $E_D$ and
$E_F$ are entanglement of distillation and formation respectively. We also
exhibit a general theorem on bounds for distillable entanglement. The results
are obtained by use of a very transparent reasoning based on the fundamental
principle of entanglement theory saying that entanglement cannot increase under
local operations and classical communication.
