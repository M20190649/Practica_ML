Quantum coherence and interaction-free measurements
We investigate the extent to which ``interaction-free'' measurements perturb
the state of quantum systems. We show that the absence of energy exchange
during the measurement is not a sufficient criterion to preserve that state, as
the quantum system is subject to measurement dependent decoherence. While it is
possible in general to design interaction-free measurement schemes that do
preserve that state, the requirement of quantum coherence preservation rapidly
leads to a very low efficiency. Our results, which have a simple interpretation
in terms of ``which-way'' arguments, open up the way to novel quantum
non-demolition techniques.
