An Alternative Commutation Relation Between Position and Momentum
  Operators of Massless Particles
It seems that the problem of finding a suitable position operator for photon
has been solved in a recently published work which is based on a new
commutation relation between position and momentum operators of massless
particles[1]. Although the authors of [1] have presented a classical reasoning
in favour of the new commutator,here we are going to find this new commutator
based on a quantum mechanical argument.
