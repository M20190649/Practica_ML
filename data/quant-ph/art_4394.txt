Exciting Relative Number Squeezed Particles from Condensates Using
  Stimulated Light Scattering
We investigate the relative particle number squeezing produced in the excited
states of a weakly interacting condensate at zero temperature by stimulated
light scattering using a pair of lasers. We shall show that a modest number of
relative number squeezed particles can be achieved when atoms with momentum
$k$, produced in pairs through collisions in the condensate, are scattered out
by their interaction with the lasers. This squeezing is optimal when the
momentum $k$ is larger than the inverse healing length, $k>k_0$. This modest
number of relative number squeezed particles has the potential to be amplified
in four-wave-mixing experiments.
