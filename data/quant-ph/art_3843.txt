How big is a quantum computer?
Accounting for resources is the central issue in computational efficiency. We
point out physical constraints implicit in information readout that have been
overlooked in classical computing. The basic particle-counting mode of read-out
sets a lower bound on the resources needed to implement a quantum computer. As
a consequence, computers based on classical waves are as efficient as those
based on single quantum particles.
