A method of enciphering quantum states
In this paper, we propose a method of enciphering quantum states of two-state
systems (qubits) for sending them in secrecy without entangled qubits shared by
two legitimate users (Alice and Bob). This method has the following two
properties. First, even if an eavesdropper (Eve) steals qubits, she can extract
information from them with certain probability at most. Second, Alice and Bob
can confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring
a signature. If Eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and
sends alternative ones (the Intercept/Resend attack), a probability that Alice
and Bob do not notice Eve's action is equal to (3/4)^m or less. Passwords for
decryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are
disclosed through a public channel. Enciphering classical information by this
method is equivalent to the one-time pad method with distributing a classical
key (random binary string) by the BB84 protocol. If Eve takes away qubits,
Alice and Bob lose the original quantum information. If we apply our method to
a state in iteration, Eve's success probability decreases exponentially. We
cannot examine security against the case that Eve makes an attack with using
entanglement. This remains to be solved in the future.
