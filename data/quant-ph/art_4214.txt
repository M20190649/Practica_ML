Bell's theorem without inequalities and only two distant observers
A proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities and involving only two
observers is given by suitably extending a proof of the Bell-Kochen-Specker
theorem due to Mermin. This proof is generalized to obtain an inequality-free
proof of Bell's theorem for a set of n Bell states (with n odd) shared between
two distant observers. A generalized CHSH inequality is formulated for n Bell
states shared symmetrically between two observers and it is shown that quantum
mechanics violates this inequality by an amount that grows exponentially with
increasing n.
