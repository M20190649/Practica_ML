Role of entanglement in two-photon imaging
The use of entangled photons in an imaging system can exhibit effects that
cannot be mimicked by any other two-photon source, whatever the strength of the
correlations between the two photons. We consider a two-photon imaging system
in which one photon is used to probe a remote (transmissive or scattering)
object, while the other serves as a reference. We discuss the role of
entanglement versus correlation in such a setting, and demonstrate that
entanglement is a prerequisite for achieving distributed quantum imaging.
