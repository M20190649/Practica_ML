Space-time properties of free motion time-of-arrival eigenstates
The properties of the time-of-arrival operator for free motion introduced by
Aharonov and Bohm and of its self-adjoint variants are studied. The domains of
applicability of the different approaches are clarified. It is shown that the
arrival time of the eigenstates is not sharply defined. However, strongly
peaked real-space (normalized) wave packets constructed with narrow Gaussian
envelopes centred on one of the eigenstates provide an arbitrarily sharp
arrival time.
