Hybrid quantum computing
Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the construction of a
hybrid quantum computer that operates on both continuous and discrete quantum
variables. Such hybrid computers are shown to be more efficient than
conventional quantum computers for performing a variety of quantum algorithms,
such as computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
