Quantum Carry-Save Arithmetic
This paper shows how to design efficient arithmetic elements out of quantum
gates using "carry-save" techniques borrowed from classical computer design.
This allows bit-parallel evaluation of all the arithmetic elements required for
Shor's algorithm, including modular arithmetic, deferring all carry propagation
until the end of the entire computation. This reduces the quantum gate delay
from O(N^3) to O(N log N) at a cost of increasing the number of qubits required
from O(N) to O(N^2).
