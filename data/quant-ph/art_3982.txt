Quantum Gambling Using Two Nonorthogonal States
We give a (remote) quantum gambling scheme that makes use of the fact that
quantum nonorthogonal states cannot be distinguished with certainty. In the
proposed scheme, two participants Alice and Bob can be regarded as playing a
game of making guesses on identities of quantum states that are in one of two
given nonorthogonal states: if Bob makes a correct (an incorrect) guess on the
identity of a quantum state that Alice has sent, he wins (loses). It is shown
that the proposed scheme is secure against the nonentanglement attack. It can
also be shown heuristically that the scheme is secure in the case of the
entanglement attack.
