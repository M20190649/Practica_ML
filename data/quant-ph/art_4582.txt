Supersymmetric approach for generating quasi-exactly solvable potentials
  with arbitrary two known eigenstates
Using supersymmetric quantum mechanics we construct the quasi-exactly
solvable (QES) potentials with arbitrary two known eigenstates. The QES
potential and the wave functions of the two energy levels are expressed by some
generating function the properties of which determine the state numbers of
these levels. Choosing different generating functions we present a few explicit
examples of the QES potentials.
