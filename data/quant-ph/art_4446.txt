The Lie algebra Structure and Nonlinear Controllability of Spin Systems
In this paper, we study the controllability properties and the Lie algebra
structure of networks of particles with spin immersed in an electro-magnetic
field. We relate the Lie algebra structure to the properties of a graph whose
nodes represent the particles and an edge connects two nodes if and only if the
interaction between the two corresponding particles is active. For networks
with different gyromagnetic ratios, we provide a necessary and sufficient
condition of controllability in terms of the properties of the above mentioned
graph and describe the Lie algebra structure in every case. For these systems
all the controllability notions, including the possibility of driving the
evolution operator and/or the state, are equivalent. For general networks (with
possibly equal gyromagnetic ratios), we give a sufficient condition of
controllability. A general form of interaction among the particles is assumed
which includes both Ising and Heisenberg models as special cases.
  Assuming Heisenberg interaction we provide an analysis of low dimensional
cases (number of particles less then or equal to three) which include necessary
and sufficient controllability conditions as well as a study of their Lie
algebra structure. This also, provides an example of quantum mechanical systems
where controllability of the state is verified while controllability of the
evolution operator is not.
