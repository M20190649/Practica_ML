Continuous measurements, quantum trajectories, and decoherent histories
Quantum open systems are described in the Markovian limit by master equations
in Lindblad form. I argue that common ``quantum trajectory'' techniques
corresponding to continuous measurement schemes, which solve the master
equation by unraveling its evolution into stochastic trajectories in Hilbert
space, correspond closely to particular sets of decoherent (or consistent)
histories. This is illustrated by a simple model of photon counting. An
equivalence is shown for these models between standard quantum jumps and the
orthogonal jumps of Di\'osi, which have already been shown to correspond to
decoherent histories. This correspondence is compared to simple treatments of
trajectories based on repeated or continuous measurements.
