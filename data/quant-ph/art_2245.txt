Arbitrary phase rotation of the marked state can not be used for
  Grover's quantum search algorithm
A misunderstanding that an arbitrary phase rotation of the marked state
together with the inversion about average operation in Grover's search
algorithm can be used to construct a (less efficient) quantum search algorithm
is cleared. The $\pi$ rotation of the phase of the marked state is not only the
choice for efficiency, but also vital in Grover's quantum search algorithm. The
results also show that Grover's quantum search algorithm is robust.
