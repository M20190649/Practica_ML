A Quantum solution to the Byzantine agreement problem
We present a solution to an old and timely problem in distributed computing.
Like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), quantum channels make it possible to
achieve taks classically impossible. However, unlike QKD, here the goal is not
secrecy but agreement, and the adversary is not outside but inside the game,
and the resources require qutrits.
