Random Hamiltonian Models and Quantum Prediction Algorithms
This paper describes an algorithm for selecting a consistent set within the
consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics and investigates its
properties. The algorithm select from among the consistent sets formed by
projections defined by the Schmidt decomposition by making projections at the
earliest possible time. The algorithm unconditionally predicts the possible
events in closed quantum systems and ascribes probabilities to these events. A
simple random Hamiltonian model is described and the results of applying the
algorithm to this model using computer programs are discussed and compared with
approximate analytic calculations.
