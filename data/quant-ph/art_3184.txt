Fermi gas in harmonic oscillator potentials
Assuming the validity of grand canonical statistics, we study the properties
of a spin-polarized Fermi gas in harmonic traps. Universal forms of Fermi
temperature $T_F$, internal energy $U$ and the specific heat per particle of
the trapped Fermi gas are calculated as a {\it function} of particle number,
and the results compared with those of infinite number particles.
