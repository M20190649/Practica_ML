Spin-Orbit Pendulum: the Microscopic Stern-Gerlach Effect
The motion of a particle with a spin in spherical harmonic oscillator
potential with spin-orbit interaction is studied. We have focus our attention
on spatial motion of wave packets, giving a description complementary to motion
of spin discussed already in [1]. The particular initial conditions studied
here lead to the most transparent formulas and can be treated analytically. A
strong analogy with the Stern-Gerlach experiment is suggested. [1] R.Arvieu and
