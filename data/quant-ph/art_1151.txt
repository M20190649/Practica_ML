Three Body Multichannel Scattering as a Model of Irreversible Quantum
  Mechanics
The new formulation of the theory of multichannel scattering on the example
of collinear model is proposed. It is shown, that in the closed three-body
scattering system the principle of quantum determinism in general case breaks
down and we have a micro- irreversible quantum mechanics.
