Superoscillations and tunneling times
It is proposed that superoscillations play an important role in the
interferences which give rise to superluminal effects. To exemplify that, we
consider a toy model which allows for a wave packet to travel, in zero time and
negligible distortion a distance arbitrarily larger than the width of the wave
packet. The peak is shown to result from a superoscillatory superposition at
the tail. Similar reasoning applies to the dwell time.
