The Real Significance of the Electromagnetic Potentials
The importance of the potential is revealed in a newly discovered effect of
the potential. This paper explore the same issue introduced in quant-ph/9506038
from several different aspects including electron optics and relativity. Some
people fail to recognize this effect due to a wrong application of gauge
invariance.
