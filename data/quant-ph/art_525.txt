Time Symmetry in Microphysics
Physics takes for granted that interacting physical systems with no common
history are independent, before their interaction. This principle is
time-asymmetric, for no such restriction applies to systems with no common
future, after an interaction. The time-asymmetry is normally attributed to
boundary conditions. I argue that there are two distinct independence
principles of this kind at work in contemporary physics, one of which cannot be
attributed to boundary conditions, and therefore conflicts with the assumed T
(or CPT) symmetry of microphysics. I note that this may have interesting
ramifications in quantum mechanics.
