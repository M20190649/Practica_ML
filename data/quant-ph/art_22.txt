Quantum Nonlocality in Two-Photon Experiments at Berkeley
We review some of our experiments performed over the past few years on
two-photon interference. These include a test of Bell's inequalities, a study
of the complementarity principle, an application of EPR correlations for
dispersion-free time-measurements, and an experiment to demonstrate the
superluminal nature of the tunneling process. The nonlocal character of the
quantum world is brought out clearly by these experiments. As we explain,
however, quantum nonlocality is not inconsistent with Einstein causality.
