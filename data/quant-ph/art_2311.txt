Quantum correlations are not contained in the initial state
Two proofs are presented which show that quantum mechanics is incompatible
with the following assumption: all possible correlations between subsystems of
an individual isolated composite quantum system are contained in the initial
quantum state of the whole system, although just a subset of them is revealed
by the actual experiment.
