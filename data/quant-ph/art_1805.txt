On Superluminal motions in photon and particle tunnelings
It is shown that the Hartman-Fletcher effect is valid for all the known
expressions of the mean tunnelling time, in various nonrelativistic approaches,
for the case of finite width barriers without absorption. Then, we show that
the same effect is not valid for the tunnelling time mean-square fluctuations.
On the basis of the Hartman-Fletcher effect and the known analogy between
photon and nonrelativistic-particle tunnelling, one can explain the
Superluminal group-velocities observed in various photon tunnelling experiments
(without violation of the so-called "Einstein causality").
