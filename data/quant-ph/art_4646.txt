Coherent and compatible information: a basis to information analysis of
  quantum systems
Relevance of key quantum information measures for analysis of quantum systems
is discussed. It is argued that possible ways of measuring quantum information
are based on compatibility/incompatibility of the quantum states of a quantum
system, resulting in the coherent information and introduced here the
compatible information measures, respectively. A sketch of an information
optimization of a quantum experimental setup is proposed.
