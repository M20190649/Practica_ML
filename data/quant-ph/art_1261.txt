Unified treatment of the Coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials in
  $D$ dimensions
Quantum mechanical models and practical calculations often rely on some
exactly solvable models like the Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator
potentials. The $D$ dimensional generalized Coulomb potential contains these
potentials as limiting cases, thus it establishes a continuous link between the
Coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials in various dimensions. We present
results which are necessary for the utilization of this potential as a model
and practical reference problem for quantum mechanical calculations. We define
a Hilbert space basis, the generalized Coulomb-Sturmian basis, and calculate
the Green's operator on this basis and also present an SU(1,1) algebra
associated with it. We formulate the problem for the one-dimensional case too,
and point out that the complications arising due to the singularity of the
one-dimensional Coulomb problem can be avoided with the use of the generalized
Coulomb potential.
