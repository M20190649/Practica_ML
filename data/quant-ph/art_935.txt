Decoherence for phase-sensitive relaxation
The linear and quadratic interactions of an impurity vibrational mode coupled
with a heat bath are investigated with a non-Markovian equation of motion for
the reduced density matrix valid for the initial, intermediate and kinetic
stages of relaxation. The evolution of the superpositional states is considered
for all cases.
