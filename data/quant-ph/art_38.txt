INTRINSIC MECHANISM FOR ENTROPY CHANGE IN CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM
  EVOLUTION
It is shown that the existence of a time operator in the Liouville space
representation of both classical and quantum evolution provides a mechanism for
effective entropy change of physical states. In particular, an initially
effectively pure state can evolve under the usual unitary evolution to an
effectively mixed state.
