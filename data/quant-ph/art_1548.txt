Operator Formulation of Classical Mechanics and the Problem of
  Measurement
The basic concepts of classical mechanics are given in the operator form. The
dynamical equation for a hybrid system, consisting of quantum and classical
subsystems, is introduced and analyzed in the case of an ideal nonselective
measurement. The nondeterministic evolution is found to be the consequence of
the superposition of two different deterministic evolutions.
