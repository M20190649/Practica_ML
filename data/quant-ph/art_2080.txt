Generation of even and odd nonlinear coherent states
We show that a class of even and odd nonlinear coherent states, defined as
the eigenstates of product of a nonlinear function of the number operator and
the square of the boson annihilation operator, can be generated in the
center-of-mass motion of a trapped and bichromatically laser-driven ion. The
nonclasscial properties of the states are studied.
