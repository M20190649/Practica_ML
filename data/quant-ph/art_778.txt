Number phase uncertainty relations: verification by homodyning
It is shown that fundamental uncertainty relations between photon number and
canonical phase of a single-mode optical field can be verified by means of
balanced homodyne measurement. All the relevant quantities can be sampled
directly from the measured phase-dependent quadrature distribution.
