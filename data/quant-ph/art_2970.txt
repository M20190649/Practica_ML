Topological Chern indices in molecular spectra
Topological Chern indices are related to the number of rotational states in
each molecular vibrational band. Modification of the indices is associated to
the appearance of ``band degeneracies'', and exchange of rotational states
between two consecutive bands. The topological dynamical origin of these
indices is proven through a semi-classical approach, and their values are
computed in two examples. The relation with the integer quantum Hall effect is
briefly discussed.
