Quantum mechanical Carnot engine
A cyclic thermodynamic heat engine runs most efficiently if it is reversible.
Carnot constructed such a reversible heat engine by combining adiabatic and
isothermal processes for a system containing an ideal gas. Here, we present an
example of a cyclic engine based on a single quantum-mechanical particle
confined to a potential well. The efficiency of this engine is shown to equal
the Carnot efficiency because quantum dynamics is reversible. The quantum heat
engine has a cycle consisting of adiabatic and isothermal quantum processes
that are close analogues of the corresponding classical processes.
