What is Quantum Computation?
Quantum computation is a rapidly progressing field today. What are its
principles? In what sense is it distinct from conventional computation? What
are its advantages and disadvantages? What type of problems can it address? How
practical is it to make a quantum computer? I summarise some of the important
concepts of quantum computation, in an attempt to answer these questions. A
deeper understanding of them would pave the way for future development.
