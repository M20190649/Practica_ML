Quantum systems coupled to a structured reservoir with multiple
  excitations
We present a method for dealing with quantum systems coupled to a structured
reservoir with any density of modes and with more than one excitation. We apply
the method to a two-level atom coupled to the edge of a photonic band gap and a
defect mode. Results pertaining to this system, provide the solution to the
problem of two photons in the reservoir and possible generalization is
discussed.
