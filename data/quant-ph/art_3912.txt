Image and Coherence Transfer in the Stimulated Down-conversion Process
The intensity transverse profile of the light produced in the process of
stimulated down-conversion is derived. A quantum-mechanical treatment is used.
We show that the angular spectrum of the pump laser can be transferred to the
stimulated down-converted beam, so that images can also be transferred from the
pump to the down-converted beam. We also show that the transfer can occur from
the stimulating beam to the down-converted one. Finally, we study the process
of diffraction through an arbitrarily shaped screen. For the special case of a
double-slit, the interference pattern is explicitly obtained. The visibility
for the spontaneous emitted light is in accordance with the van Cittert -
Zernike theorem for incoherent light, while the visibility for the stimulated
emitted light is unity. The overall visibility is in accordance with previous
experimental results.
