Demonstration of Non-Deterministic Quantum Logic Operations using Linear
  Optical Elements
Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn recently showed that non-deterministic quantum
logic operations could be performed using linear optical elements, additional
photons (ancilla), and post-selection based on the output of single-photon
detectors [Nature 409, 46 (2001)]. Here we report the experimental
demonstration of two logic devices of this kind, a destructive controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate and a quantum parity check. These two devices can be combined with
a pair of entangled photons to implement a conventional (non-destructive) CNOT
that succeeds with a probability of 1/4.
