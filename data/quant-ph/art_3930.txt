Quantum Teleportation with a Complete Bell State Measurement
We report a quantum teleportation experiment in which nonlinear interactions
are used for the Bell state measurements. The experimental results demonstrate
the working principle of irreversibly teleporting an unknown arbitrary quantum
state from one system to another distant system by disassembling into and then
later reconstructing from purely classical information and nonclassical EPR
correlations. The distinct feature of this experiment is that \emph{all} four
Bell states can be distinguished in the Bell state measurement. Teleportation
of a quantum state can thus occur with certainty in principle.
