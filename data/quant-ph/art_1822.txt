Quantum computation over continuous variables
This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing a
universal quantum computer over continuous variables. As an example, it is
shown how a universal quantum computer for the amplitudes of the
electromagnetic field might be constructed using simple linear devices such as
beam-splitters and phase shifters, together with squeezers and nonlinear
devices such as Kerr-effect fibers and atoms in optical cavities. Such a device
could in principle perform `quantum floating point' computations. Problems of
noise, finite precision, and error correction are discussed.
