Interference-induced gain in Autler-Townes doublet of a V-type atom in a
  cavity
We study the Autler-Townes spectrum of a V-type atom coupled to a
single-mode, frequency-tunable cavity field at finite termperature, with a
pre-selected polarization in the bad cavity limit, and show that, when the mean
number of thermal photons $N\gg 1$ and the excited sublevel splitting is very
large (the same order as the cavity linewidth), the probe gain may occur at
either sideband of the doublet, depending on the cavity frequency, due to the
cavity-induced interference.
