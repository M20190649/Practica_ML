Wave Function Interpretation and Quantum Mechanics Equations
The quantum mechanics description of a physical object stretched in space and
stable in time from the relativistic space-time properties point of view,
introduced in special theory of relativity, is considered and analysed. The
mathematical model of physical objects is proposed. This model gives a
possibility to unite a description of corpuscular and wave properties of real
physical objects, i.e. fields and particles. There are substantiated an
approach and a mathematical pattern which give a possibility to describe
physical object not only in causal, but also in absolute remote fields of the
Minkowski space. Applying the proposed approach to the microcosm description,
one can get the equations that in passage to the limit transfer to such quantum
mechanics equations as Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon-Fock and in particular case -
the wave equation. The event nature of the received equations is discussed. It
is shown that all mentioned equations reflect the space-time relativistic
properties during the description of the invariant and non-invariant physics
object characteristics.
