Induced coherence with and without induced emission
We analyze signal coherence in the setup of Wang, Zou and Mandel, where two
optical downconverters have indistinct idler modes. Quantum interference,
caused by indistinguishability of paths, has a visibility proportional to the
transmission amplitude between idlers. Classical interference, caused by
induced emission, may be complete for any finite transmission.
