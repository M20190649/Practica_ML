Against "knowledge"
Quantum "states" are objective probability measures. Because their dependence
on a time is not the time dependence of an evolving state, they are neither
states of Nature nor "states of knowledge." There is no such thing as an
evolving state. This disposes of the problem posed by the apparent existence of
two modes of evolution. What essentially stands in the way of a consistent
ontological interpretation of the quantum theory is our habit of projecting
into the quantum world the detached, intrinsically differentiated
spatiotemporal background of classical physics, for this is what entails the
existence of an evolving state. An objective probability measure is the formal
expression of an objective indefiniteness, such as the positional
indefiniteness that contributes to "fluff out" matter. An objective
indefiniteness entails that the values of certain observables are extrinsic
(possessed because they are indicated) rather than intrinsic (indicated because
they are possessed). This dependence on value-indicating facts is not a
dependence on anything external to the quantum world. The latter constitutes a
free-standing reality that owes nothing to observers, "information," or our
interventions into "the course of Nature."
