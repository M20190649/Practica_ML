Quantum Probability from Decision Theory?
In a recent paper (quant-ph/9906015), Deutsch claims to derive the
"probabilistic predictions of quantum theory" from the "non-probabilistic
axioms of quantum theory" and the "non-probabilistic part of classical decision
theory." We show that his derivation fails because it includes hidden
probabilistic assumptions.
