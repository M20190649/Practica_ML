Quantum feedback with weak measurements
The problem of feedback control of quantum systems by means of weak
measurements is investigated in detail. When weak measurements are made on a
set of identical quantum systems, the single-system density matrix can be
determined to a high degree of accuracy while affecting each system only
slightly. If this information is fed back into the systems by coherent
operations, the single-system density matrix can be made to undergo an
arbitrary nonlinear dynamics, including for example a dynamics governed by a
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We investigate the implications of such
nonlinear quantum dynamics for various problems in quantum control and quantum
information theory, including quantum computation. The nonlinear dynamics
induced by weak quantum feedback could be used to create a novel form of
quantum chaos in which the time evolution of the single-system wave function
depends sensitively on initial conditions.
