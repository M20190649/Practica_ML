Quantum Teleportation is a Universal Computational Primitive
We present a method to create a variety of interesting gates by teleporting
quantum bits through special entangled states. This allows, for instance, the
construction of a quantum computer based on just single qubit operations, Bell
measurements, and GHZ states. We also present straightforward constructions of
a wide variety of fault-tolerant quantum gates.
