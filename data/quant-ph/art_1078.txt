Monge Distance between Quantum States
We define a metric in the space of quantum states taking the Monge distance
between corresponding Husimi distributions (Q--functions). This quantity
fulfills the axioms of a metric and satisfies the following semiclassical
property: the distance between two coherent states is equal to the Euclidean
distance between corresponding points in the classical phase space. We compute
analytically distances between certain states (coherent, squeezed, Fock and
thermal) and discuss a scheme for numerical computation of Monge distance for
two arbitrary quantum states.
