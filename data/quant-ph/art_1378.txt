Nonclassical evolution of a free particle
A conditional kinetic energy is defined in terms of the Wigner distribution.
It is shown that this kinetic energy may become negative for negative Wigner
distributions. A free particle wave packet with negative kinetic energy will
spread in a nonclassical manner.
