Classical limit in terms of symbolic dynamics for the quantum baker's
  map
We derive a simple closed form for the matrix elements of the quantum baker's
map that shows that the map is an approximate shift in a symbolic
representation based on discrete phase space. We use this result to give a
formal proof that the quantum baker's map approaches a classical Bernoulli
shift in the limit of a small effective Plank's constant.
