Are all noisy quantum states obtained from pure ones?
We ask what type of mixed quantum states can arise when a number of separated
parties start by sharing a pure quantum state and then this pure state becomes
contaminated by noise. We show that not all mixed states arise in this way.
This is even the case if the separated parties actively try to degrade their
initial pure state by arbitrary local actions and classical communication.
