Quantum Statistics Can Suppress Classical Interference
Classical optical interference experiments correspond to a measurement of the
first-order correlation function of the electromagnetic field. The converse of
this statement: experiments that measure the first order correlation functions
do not distinguish between the quantum and classical theories of light, does
not always hold. A counterexample is given.
