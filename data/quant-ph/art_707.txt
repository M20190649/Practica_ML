Subdynamics through Time Scales and Scattering Maps in Quantum Field
  Theory
It is argued that the dynamics of an isolated system, due to the concrete
procedure by which it is separated from the environment, has a non-Hamiltonian
contribution. By a unified quantum field theoretical treatment of typical
subdynamics, e.g., hydrodynamics, kinetic theory, master equation for a
particle interacting with matter, we look for the structure of this more
general dynamics.
