A quantum measurement of the spin direction
We give a first physical model for the quantum measurement of the spin
direction. It is an Arthurs-Kelly model that involves a kind of magnetic-dipole
interaction of the spin with three modes of radiation. We show that in a limit
of infinite squeezing of radiation the optimal POVM for the measurement of the
spin direction is achieved for spin 1/2.
