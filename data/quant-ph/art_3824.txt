Performance of a deterministic source of entangled photonic qubits
We study the possible limitations and sources of decoherence in the scheme
for the deterministic generation of polarization-entangled photons, recently
proposed by Gheri et al. [K. M. Gheri et al., Phys. Rev. A 58, R2627 (1998)],
based on an appropriately driven single atom trapped within an optical cavity.
We consider in particular the effects of laser intensity fluctuations, photon
losses, and atomic motion.
