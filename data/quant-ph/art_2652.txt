Universal cloning of continuous quantum variables
The cloning of quantum variables with continuous spectra is analyzed. A
universal - or Gaussian - quantum cloning machine is exhibited that copies
equally well the states of two conjugate variables such as position and
momentum. It also duplicates all coherent states with a fidelity of 2/3. More
generally, the copies are shown to obey a no-cloning Heisenberg-like
uncertainty relation.
