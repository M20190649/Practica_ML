On the Theory of Quantum Secret Sharing
I present a variety of results on the theory of quantum secret sharing. I
show that any mixed state quantum secret sharing scheme can be derived by
discarding a share from a pure state scheme, and that the size of each share in
a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at least as large as the size of the
secret. I show that the only constraints on the existence of quantum secret
sharing schemes with general access structures are monotonicity (if a set is
authorized, so are larger sets) and the no-cloning theorem. I also discuss some
aspects of sharing classical secrets using quantum states. In this situation,
the size of each share can sometimes be half the size of the classical secret.
