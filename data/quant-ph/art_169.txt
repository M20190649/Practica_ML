Comment on 'Reduced System Dynamics from the N-Body Schrodinger
  Equation'
We argue that the "reduced wave function", proposed recently [Phys.Rev.Lett.
{\bf 75}, 2255 (1995)], contains conditional and restricted information on the
reduced system. The concept of "reduced wave function" can thus not represent a
relevant alternative to the common reduced dynamics methods.
