Quantum dynamics and statistics of two coupled down-conversion processes
In the framework of Heisenberg-Langevin theory the dynamical and statistical
effects arising from the linear interaction of two nondegenerate
down-conversion processes are investigated. Using the strong-pumping
approximation the analytical solution of equations of motion is calculated. The
phenomena reminiscent of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are examined. The
possibility of phase-controlled and mismatch-controlled switching is
illustrated.
