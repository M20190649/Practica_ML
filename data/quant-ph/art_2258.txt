On energy transfer by detection of a tunneling atom
We are in the process of building an experiment to study the tunneling of
laser-cooled Rubidium atoms through an optical barrier. A particularly thorny
set of questions arises when one considers the possibility of observing a
tunneling particle while it is in the ``forbidden'' region. In earlier work, we
have discussed how one might probe a tunneling atom ``weakly,'' so as to
prevent collapse. Here we make some observations about the implications of a
more traditional quantum measurement. Considerations of energy conservation
suggest that attempts to observe tunneling atoms will enhance inelastic
scattering, but not in a way which can be directly observed. It is possible
that attempts to make such measurements may lead to experimentally realizable
``observationally assisted barrier penetration.''
