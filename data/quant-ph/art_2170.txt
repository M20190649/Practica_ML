A General Type of a Coherent States with Thermal Effects
Within the framework of thermofield dynamics, we construct a thermalized
coherent thermal state, which is a general type of the coherent state with the
thermal effects and can be presumably produced experimentally. The wavefunction
and the density matrix element in the coordinate repersentation are calculated,
and furthermore we give the probability densities, average values and variances
of the position, momentum and particle number, which in special cases are
consistent with those in the literature. All calculations are performed in the
coordinate representation.
