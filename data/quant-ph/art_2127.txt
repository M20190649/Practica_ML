Direct measurement of the Wigner function by photon counting
We report a direct measurement of the Wigner function characterizing the
quantum state of a light mode. The experimental scheme is based on the
representation of the Wigner function as an expectation value of a displaced
photon number parity operator. This allowed us to scan the phase space
point-by-point, and obtain the complete Wigner function without using any
numerical reconstruction algorithms.
