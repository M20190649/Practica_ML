Covariant localizations in the torus and the phase observables
We describe all the localization observables of a quantum particle in a
one-dimensional box in terms of sequences of unit vectors in a Hilbert space.
An alternative representation in terms of positive semidefinite complex
matrices is furnished and the commutative localizations are singled out. As a
consequence, we also get a vector sequence characterization of the covariant
phase observables.
