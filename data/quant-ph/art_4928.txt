Coherent radiation from neutral molecules moving above a grating
We predict and study the quantum-electrodynamical effect of parametric
self-induced excitation of a molecule moving above the dielectric or conducting
medium with periodic grating. In this case the radiation reaction force
modulates the molecular transition frequency which results in a parametric
instability of dipole oscillations even from the level of quantum or thermal
fluctuations. The present mechanism of instability of electrically neutral
molecules is different from that of the well-known Smith-Purcell and transition
radiation in which a moving charge and its oscillating image create an
oscillating dipole.
  We show that parametrically excited molecular bunches can produce an easily
detectable coherent radiation flux of up to a microwatt.
