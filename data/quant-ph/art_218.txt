Quantum Electrodynamics at Large Distances II: Nature of the Dominant
  Singularities
Accurate calculations of macroscopic and mesoscopic properties in quantum
electrodynamics require careful treatment of infrared divergences: standard
treatments introduce spurious large-distances effects. A method for computing
these properties was developed in a companion paper. That method depends upon a
result obtained here about the nature of the singularities that produce the
dominant large-distance behaviour. If all particles in a quantum field theory
have non-zero mass then the Landau-Nakanishi diagrams give strong conditions on
the singularities of the scattering functions. These conditions are severely
weakened in quantum electrodynamics by effects of points where photon momenta
vanish. A new kind of Landau-Nakanishi diagram is developed here. It is geared
specifically to the pole-decomposition functions that dominate the macroscopic
behaviour in quantum electrodynamics, and leads to strong results for these
functions at points where photon momenta vanish.
