Effect of Attenuation and Dispersion in the Communication Channel on the
  Secrecy of a Quantum Cryptosystem
The effects of dispersion in the communication channel on the secrecy of a
quantum cryptosystem based on single photon states with different frequencies
are studied. A maximum communication channel length which can still ensure the
secrecy of the key generation procedure is found.
