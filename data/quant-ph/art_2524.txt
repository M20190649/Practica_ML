New Treatment of Systems of Compounded Angular Momentum
The approach to quantum mechanics which we have used to derive the matrix
treatment of spin from first principles is now employed to treat systems of
compounded angular momentum. A general treatment is first given, which is then
applied to the concrete cases of a spin-0 and a spin-1 system obtained by
adding the spins of two spin-1/2 systems. Thus the probability amplitudes for
measurements on the systems are derived, as well as the matrix vectors and
operators corresponding to the systems. The matrix operators and states
obtained are different from the standard forms and are much more generalized.
The new results are applied to the case of joint measurements on the subsystems
of such a system; this is a problem that has been made very topical by the high
level of interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics. As a consequence of
the insights arising from this treatment, we show that the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients are amenable to generalization, and we give the generalized forms
for these cases.
