Cavity implementation of quantum interference in a $Î›$-type atom
A scheme for engineering quantum interference in a $\Lambda$-type atom
coupled to a frequency-tunable, single-mode cavity field with a pre-selected
polarization at finite temperature is proposed. Interference-assisted
population trapping, population inversions and probe gain at one sideband of
the Autler-Townes spectrum are predicted for certain cavity resonant
frequencies.
