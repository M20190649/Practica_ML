Reply to a Comment on "the Role of Dimensionality in the Stability of a
  Confined Condensed Bose Gas"
As pointed out by the authors of the comment quant-ph/9712046, in our paper
quant-ph/9712030 we studied in detail the metastability of a Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC) confined in an harmonic trap with zero-range interaction. As
well known, the BEC with attractive zero-range interaction is not stable but
can be metastable. In our paper we analyzed the role of dimensionality for the
metastability of the BEC with attractive and repulsive interaction.
