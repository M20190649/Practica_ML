Unified approach to quantum capacities: towards quantum noisy coding
  theorem
Basing on unified approach to {\it all} kinds of quantum capacities we show
that the rate of quantum information transmission is bounded by the maximal
attainable rate of coherent information. Moreover, we show that, if for any
bipartite state the one-way distillable entanglement is no less than coherent
information, then one obtains Shannon-like formulas for all the capacities. The
inequality also implies that the decrease of distillable entanglement due to
mixing process does not exceed of corresponding loss information about a
system.
