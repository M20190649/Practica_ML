Intermediate coherent-phase(PB) states of radiation fields and their
  nonclassical properties
Intermediate states interpolating coherent states and Pegg-Barnett phase
states are investigated using the ladder operator approach. These states reduce
to coherent and Pegg-Barnett phase states in two different limits. Statistical
and squeezing properties are studied in detail.
