Time-like flows of energy-momentum and particle trajectories for the
  Klein-Gordon equation
The Klein-Gordon equation is interpreted in the de Broglie-Bohm manner as a
single-particle relativistic quantum mechanical equation that defines unique
time-like particle trajectories. The particle trajectories are determined by
the conserved flow of the intrinsic energy density which can be derived from
the specification of the Klein-Gordon energy-momentum tensor in an
Einstein-Riemann space. The approach is illustrated by application to the
simple single-particle phenomena associated with square potentials.
