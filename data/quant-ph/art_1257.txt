Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Higher-Dimensional Systems
Instead of a quantum computer where the fundamental units are 2-dimensional
qubits, we can consider a quantum computer made up of d-dimensional systems.
There is a straightforward generalization of the class of stabilizer codes to
d-dimensional systems, and I will discuss the theory of fault-tolerant
computation using such codes. I prove that universal fault-tolerant computation
is possible with any higher-dimensional stabilizer code for prime d.
