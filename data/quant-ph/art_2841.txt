Maxwell equations as the one-photon quantum equation
Maxwell equations (Faraday and Ampere-Maxwell laws) can be presented as a
three component equation in a way similar to the two component neutrino
equation. However, in this case, the electric and magnetic Gauss's laws can not
be derived from first principles. We have shown how all Maxwell equations can
be derived simultaneously from first principles, similar to those which have
been used to derive the Dirac relativistic electron equation. We have also
shown that equations for massless particles, derived by Dirac in 1936, lead to
the same result. The complex wave function, being a linear combination of the
electric and magnetic fields, is a locally measurable and well understood
quantity. Therefore Maxwell equations should be used as a guideline for proper
interpretations of quantum theories.
