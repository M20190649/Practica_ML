A Simple Algorithm for Local Conversion of Pure States
We describe an algorithm for converting one bipartite quantum state into
another using only local operations and classical communication, which is much
simpler than the original algorithm given by Nielsen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 436
(1999)]. Our algorithm uses only a single measurement by one of the parties,
followed by local unitary operations which are permutations in the local
Schmidt bases.
