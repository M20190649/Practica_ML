Quantum probabilities as Bayesian probabilities
In the Bayesian approach to probability theory, probability quantifies a
degree of belief for a single trial, without any a priori connection to
limiting frequencies. In this paper we show that, despite being prescribed by a
fundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood
within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical
and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of
the information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about
a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for
all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world,
maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this
distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum
mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal
information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment,
and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and
measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a
Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.
