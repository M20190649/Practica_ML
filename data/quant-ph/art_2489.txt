Quantum state reconstruction in the presence of dissipation
We propose a realistic scheme to determine the quantum state of a single mode
cavity field even after it has started to decay due to the coupling with an
environment. Although dissipation destroys quantum coherences, we show that at
zero temperature enough information about the initial state remains, in an
observable quantity, to allow the reconstruction of its Wigner function.
