Casimir Effect on a Finite Lattice
This article presents a Hamiltonian lattice formulation of static Casimir
systems at a level of generality appropriate for an introductory investigation.
Background structure - represented by a lattice potential V(x) - is introduced
along one spatial direction with translation invariance in all other spatial
directions. Following some general analysis two specific finite one dimensional
lattice QFT systems are analyzed in detail.
