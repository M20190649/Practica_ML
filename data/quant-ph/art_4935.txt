Entanglement Measures with Asymptotic Weak-Monotonicity as Lower (Upper)
  Bound for the Entanglement of Cost (Distillation)
We propose entanglement measures with asymptotic weak-monotonicity. We show
that a normalized form of entanglement measures with the asymptotic
weak-monotonicity are lower (upper) bound for the entanglement of cost
(distillation).
