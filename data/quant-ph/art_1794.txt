Observation of three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement
We present the experimental observation of polarization entanglement for
three spatially separated photons. Such states of more than two entangled
particles, known as GHZ states, play a crucial role in fundamental tests of
quantum mechanics versus local realism and in many quantum information and
quantum computation schemes. Our experimental arrangement is such that we start
with two pairs of entangled photons and register one photon in a way that any
information as to which pair it belongs to is erased. The registered events at
the detectors for the remaining three photons then exhibit the desired GHZ
correlations.
