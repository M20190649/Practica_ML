Formation of ultrashort pulses with sub-Poissonian photon statistics
A simple method for the production of ultrashort light pulses (USPs) with
suppressed photon fluctuations is considered. The method is based on self-phase
modulation (SPM) of an USP in a nonlinear medium (optical fibre) and subsequent
transmission of pulse through a dispersive optical element.
