Generalized Aharonov-Bohm effect, homotopy classes and Hausdorff
  dimension
We suggest as gedanken experiment a generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm
experiment, based on an array of solenoids. This experiment allows in principle
to measure the decomposition into homotopy classes of the quantum mechanical
propagator. This yields information on the geometry of the average path of
propagation and allows to determine its Hausdorff dimension.
