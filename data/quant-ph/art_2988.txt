Nuclear Teleportation
Until recently, only science-fiction authors ventured to use a term
teleportation. However, in the last few years, on the eve of upcoming new
millennium, the situation changed very much. The present report gives a
synopsis of main concepts in this area. The readers will be able to make sure
that paradoxical phenomena in the microcosm give a possibility to demonstrate
the exchange of properties between microobjects, removed at a very large
distance from each other, when no forces act between them. A new experimental
scheme with hydrogen and helium nuclei is proposed. It is expected that the
results of these experiments will be considered as teleportation of nuclear
properties of atoms of the simplest chemical elements. A problem of
teleportation of the more palpable cargo is left to the physics of the more
distant future.
