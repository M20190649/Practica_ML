Giant light shift of atoms near optical microstructures
Atoms coupled to optical fields confined in one and two spatial dimensions in
solid state microstructures can experience very large light shifts if the
driving frequencies are close to a resonance of the microstructures and an
atomic transition. Using the simple example of a quasi one-dimensional
waveguide structure we can analytically calculate the atomic AC Stark shift and
the modifications of the light field induced by the presence of the atom. A
large enhancement of the effective interaction strength is found due to a non
uniform mode density. Experimentally this should be visible by monitoring the
scattered light field as well as by the modification of the atomic trajectories
bouncing from the evanescent light.
