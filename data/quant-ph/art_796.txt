Gamow-Jordan Vectors and Non-Reducible Density Operators from Higher
  Order S-Matrix Poles
In analogy to Gamow vectors that are obtained from first order resonance
poles of the S-matrix, one can also define higher order Gamow vectors which are
derived from higher order poles of the S-matrix. An S-matrix pole of r-th order
at z_R=E_R-i\Gamma/2 leads to r generalized eigenvectors of order k= 0, 1, ...
, r-1, which are also Jordan vectors of degree (k+1) with generalized
eigenvalue (E_R-i\Gamma/2). The Gamow-Jordan vectors are elements of a
generalized complex eigenvector expansion, whose form suggests the definition
of a state operator (density matrix) for the microphysical decaying state of
this higher order pole. This microphysical state is a mixture of non-reducible
components. In spite of the fact that the k-th order Gamow-Jordan vectors has
the polynomial time-dependence which one always associates with higher order
poles, the microphysical state obeys a purely exponential decay law.
