Symplectic Tomography of Nonclassical States of Trapped Ion
The marginal distribution of squeezed and rotated quadrature for two types of
nonclassical states of trapped ion -- for squeezed and correlated states and
for squeezed even and odd coherent states (squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states)
is studied. The obtained marginal distribution for the two types of states is
shown to satisfy classical dynamical equation equivalent to standard quantum
evolution equation for density matrix (wave function) derived in symplectic
tomography scheme.
