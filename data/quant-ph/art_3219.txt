Communication Capacity of Quantum Computation
By considering quantum computation as a communication process, we relate its
efficiency to a communication capacity. This formalism allows us to rederive
lower bounds on the complexity of search algorithms. It also enables us to link
the mixedness of a quantum computer to its efficiency. We discuss the
implications of our results for quantum measurement.
