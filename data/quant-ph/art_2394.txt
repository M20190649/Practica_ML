Implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) has been implemented on a three bit
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer, providing a first step
towards the realization of Shor's factoring and other quantum algorithms.
Implementation of the QFT is presented with fidelity measures, and state
tomography. Experimentally realizing the QFT is a clear demonstration of NMR's
ability to control quantum systems.
