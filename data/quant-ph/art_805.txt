Optical von Neumann measurement
We present an optical scheme that realizes the standard von Neumann
measurement model, providing an indirect measurement of a quadrature of the
field with controllable Gaussian state-reduction. The scheme is made of simple
optical elements, as laser sources, beam splitters, and phase sensitive
amplifiers, along with a feedback mechanism that uses a Pockels cell. We show
that the von Neumann measurement is achieved without the need of working in a
ultra-short pulsed regime.
