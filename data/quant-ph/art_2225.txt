Inverted spectroscopy and interferometry for quantum-state
  reconstruction of systems with SU(2) symmetry
We consider how the conventional spectroscopic and interferometric schemes
can be rearranged to serve for reconstructing quantum states of physical
systems possessing SU(2) symmetry. The discussed systems include a collection
of two-level atoms, a two-mode quantized radiation field with a fixed total
number of photons, and a single laser-cooled ion in a two-dimensional harmonic
trap with a fixed total number of vibrational quanta. In the proposed
rearrangement, the standard spectroscopic and interferometric experiments are
inverted. Usually one measures an unknown frequency or phase shift using a
system prepared in a known quantum state. Our aim is just the inverse one,
i.e., to use a well-calibrated apparatus with known transformation parameters
to measure unknown quantum states.
