Single-Pulse Preparation of the Uniform Superpositional State used in
  Quantum Algorithms
We examine a single-pulse preparation of the uniform superpositional wave
function, which includes all basis states, in a spin quantum computer. The
effective energy spectrum and the errors generated by this pulse are studied in
detail. We show that, in spite of the finite width of the energy spectrum
bands, amplitude and phase errors can be made reasonably small.
