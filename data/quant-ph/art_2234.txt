Maximum-likelihood algorithm for quantum tomography
Optical homodyne tomography is discussed in the context of classical image
processing. Analogies between these two fields are traced and used to formulate
an iterative numerical algorithm for reconstructing the Wigner function from
homodyne statistics.
