To Enjoy the Morning Flower in the Evening -- Is Special Relativity a
  Classical Theory?
The relation between the special relativity and quantum mechanics is
discussed. Based on the postulate that space-time inversion is equavalent to
particle-antiparticle transformation, the essence of special relativity is
explored and the relativistic modification on Stationary Schr\"{o}dinger
Equation is derived.
