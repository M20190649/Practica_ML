Generalized Grover Search Algorithm for Arbitrary Initial Amplitude
  Distribution
Grover's algorithm for quantum searching of a database is generalized to deal
with arbitrary initial amplitude distributions. First order linear difference
equations are found for the time evolution of the amplitudes of the r marked
and N-r unmarked states. These equations are solved exactly. An expression for
the optimal measurement time T \sim O(\sqrt{N/r}) is derived which is shown to
depend only on the initial average amplitudes of the marked and unmarked
states. A bound on the probability of measuring a marked state is derived,
which depends only on the standard deviation of the initial amplitude
distributions of the marked or unmarked states.
