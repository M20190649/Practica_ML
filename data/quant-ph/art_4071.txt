Inseparability criteria for demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
  gedanken experiment
It is shown that a criterion used to demonstrate realization of the 1935
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) gedanken experiment is sufficient to
demonstrate quantum entanglement.
  A further set of measurable criteria sufficient to demonstrate EPR gedanken
experiment is proposed, these being the set of criteria sufficient to
demonstrate entanglement, by way of a measured violation of a necessary
condition of separability. In this way, provided the spatial separation of
systems is sufficient to ensure EPR's locality hypothesis, it is shown how a
measured demonstration of entanglement will, at least, be equivalent to a
demonstration of the EPR gedanken experiment. Using hidden variables it is
explained how such demonstrations are a direct manifestation of the
inconsistency of local realism with quantum mechanics.
