Entanglement and nonextensive statistics
It is presented a generalization of the von Neumann mutual information in the
context of Tsallis' nonextensive statistics. As an example, entanglement
between two (two-level) quantum subsystems is discussed. Important changes
occur in the generalized mutual information, which measures the degree of
entanglement, depending on the entropic index q.
