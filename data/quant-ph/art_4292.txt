The world according to quantum mechanics (or, the 18 errors of Henry P.
  Stapp)
Several errors in Stapp's interpretation of quantum mechanics and its
application to mental causation (Henry P. Stapp, "Quantum theory and the role
of mind in nature," e-Print quant-ph/0103043) are pointed out. An
interpretation of (standard) QM that avoids these errors is presented.
