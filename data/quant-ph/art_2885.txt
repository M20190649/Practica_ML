Quantum Cryptography using entangled photons in energy-time Bell states
We present a setup for quantum cryptography based on photon pairs in
energy-time Bell states and show its feasability in a laboratory experiment.
Our scheme combines the advantages of using photon pairs instead of faint laser
pulses and the possibility to preserve energy-time entanglement over long
distances. Moreover, using 4-dimensional energy-time states, no fast random
change of bases is required in our setup : Nature itself decides whether to
measure in the energy or in the time base.
