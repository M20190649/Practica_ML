Stationary quantum source coding
In this paper the quantum source coding theorem is obtained for a completely
ergodic source. This results extends Shannon's classical theorem as well as
Schumacher's quantum noiseless coding theorem for memoryless sources. The
control of the memory effects requires earlier results of Hiai and Petz on high
probability subspaces.
