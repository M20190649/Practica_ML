Quantum Clock Synchronization Based on Shared Prior Entanglement
We demonstrate that two spatially separated parties (Alice and Bob) can
utilize shared prior quantum entanglement, and classical communications, to
establish a synchronized pair of atomic clocks. In contrast to classical
synchronization schemes, the accuracy of our protocol is independent of Alice
or Bob's knowledge of their relative locations or of the properties of the
intervening medium.
