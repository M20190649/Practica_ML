Atomic versus molecular diffraction: Influence of break-ups and finite
  size
Atomic diffraction through double slits and transmission gratings is well
described in terms of the associated de Broglie waves and classical wave
optics. However, for weakly bound and relatively large systems, such as the
He_2 dimer, this might no longer hold true due to the possibility of break-up
processes and finite-size effects. We therefore study the diffraction of weakly
bound two-particle systems. If the bar and slit widths of the grating are much
larger than the diameter of the two-particle system we recover the usual optics
results. For smaller widths, however, deviations therefrom occur. We find that
the location of possible diffraction peaks is indeed still governed by the
usual grating function from optics, but the peaks may have a lower intensity.
This is not unexpected when break-up processes are allowed. More unusually
though, diffraction peaks which would be absent for de Broglie waves may
reappear. The results are illustrated for diffraction of He_2.
