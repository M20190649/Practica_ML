Hydrogen atom as an eigenvalue problem in 3D spaces of constant
  curvature and minimal length
An old result of A.F. Stevenson [Phys. Rev.} 59, 842 (1941)] concerning the
Kepler-Coulomb quantum problem on the three-dimensional (3D) hypersphere is
considered from the perspective of the radial Schr\"odinger equations on 3D
spaces of any (either positive, zero or negative) constant curvature. Further
to Stevenson, we show in detail how to get the hypergeometric wavefunction for
the hydrogen atom case. Finally, we make a comparison between the ``space
curvature" effects and minimal length effects for the hydrogen spectrum
