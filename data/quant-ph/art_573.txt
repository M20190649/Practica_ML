A precision test of decoherence
The motion of a charged particle over a conducting plate is damped by Ohmic
resistance to image currents. This interaction between the particle and the
plate must also produce decoherence, which can be detected by examining
interference patterns made by diffracted particle beams which have passed over
the plate. Because the current densities within the plate decay rapidly with
the height of the particle beam above it, the strength of decoherence should be
adjustable across a wide range, allowing one to probe the full range of quantum
through classical behaviour.
