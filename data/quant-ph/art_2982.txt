Experiments on Sonoluminescence: Possible Nuclear and QED Aspects and
  Optical Applications
Experiments aimed at testing some hypothesis about the nature of Single
Bubble Sonoluminescence are discussed. A possibility to search for micro-traces
of thermonuclear neutrons is analyzed, with the aid of original low-background
neutron counter operating under conditions of the deep shielding from Cosmic
and other sources of background. Besides, some signatures of QED-contribution
to the light emission in SBSL are under the consideration, as well as new
approaches to probe a temperature inside the bubble. An applied-physics portion
of the program is presented also, in which an attention is being paid to
single- and a few-pulse light sources on the basis of SBSL.
