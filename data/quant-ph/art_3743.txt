Toward the multiphoton parametric oscillators
We propose novel types of parametric oscillators generating both three-photon
and four-photon bright light which are accessible for an experiment. The
devices are based on the cascaded down-conversion processes and consist of
second-order media inserted in two-resonant mode cavity. Discussion of
dissipation and quantum features of the system are performed by the
quantum-jump simulation method and concerns to the Wigner functions. The
phase-space multistabilities and critical threshold behavior of three- and
four-photon subharmonics are obtained.
