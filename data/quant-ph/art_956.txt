Analytical Models for Valence Fermions in Isotropic Traps
For isotropic confining Ioffe-Pritchard or TOP potentials, a valence fermion
trapped with a closed core of other fermions can be described by an analytical
effective one-particle model with a physical eigenspectrum. Related
constructions exist for Paul and Penning traps. The analytical models arise
from quantum-mechanical supersymmetry.
