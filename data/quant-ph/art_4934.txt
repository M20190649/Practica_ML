Shor-Preskill Type Security-Proofs for Concatenated Bennett-Brassard
  1984 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
We discuss long code problems in the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key
distribution protocol and describe how they can be overcome by concatenation of
the protocol. Observing that concatenated modified Lo-Chau protocol finally
reduces to the concatenated BB84 protocol, we give the unconditional security
of the concatenated BB84 protocol.
