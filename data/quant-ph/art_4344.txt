Unconditional security in quantum bit commitment
The commitment of bits between two mutually distrustful parties is a powerful
cryptographic primitive with which many cryptographic objectives can be
achieved. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit
commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is
codified in a general impossibility theorem. Gaps in the proof of this
impossibility theorem are found. An unconditionally secure bit commitment
protocol utilizing anonymous quantum states and the no-clone theorem is
presented below with a full security proof.
