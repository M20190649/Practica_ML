Multiple Quantization and the Concept of Information
The understanding of the meaning of quantization seems to be the main problem
in understanding quantum structures. In this paper first the difference between
quantized particle vs. radiation fields in the formalism of canonical
quantization is discussed. Next von Weizsaecker's concept of ''multiple
quantization'' which leads to an understanding of quantization as an iteration
of probability theory is explained. Finally a connection between quantization
and the idea of a ''general theory of information'' is considered. This brings
together semantic information with the different levels of quantization and
expresses the philosophical attitude of this paper concerning the
interpretation of quantum theory.
