Extremal equation for optimal completely-positive maps
We derive an extremal equation for optimal completely-positive map which most
closely approximates a given transformation between pure quantum states.
Moreover, we also obtain an upper bound on the maximal mean fidelity that can
be attained by the optimal approximate transformation. The developed formalism
is applied to universal-NOT gate, quantum cloning machines, quantum entanglers,
and qubit theta-shifter.
