Entangled state quantum cryptography: Eavesdropping on the Ekert
  protocol
Using polarization-entangled photons from spontaneous parametric
downconversion, we have implemented Ekert's quantum cryptography protocol. The
near-perfect correlations of the photons allow the sharing of a secret key
between two parties. The presence of an eavesdropper is continually checked by
measuring Bell's inequalities. We investigated several possible eavesdropper
strategies, including pseudo-quantum non-demolition measurements. In all cases,
the eavesdropper's presence was readily apparent. We discuss a procedure to
increase her detectability.
