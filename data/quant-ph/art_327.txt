The capacity of the noisy quantum channel
An upper limit is given to the amount of quantum information that can be
transmitted reliably down a noisy, decoherent quantum channel. A class of
quantum error-correcting codes is presented that allow the information
transmitted to attain this limit. The result is the quantum analog of Shannon's
bound and code for the noisy classical channel.
