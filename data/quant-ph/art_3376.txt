Contact between laboratory instruments and equations of quantum
  mechanics
Ambiguity in the contact between laboratory instruments and equations of
quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of responses of the instruments to
commands transmitted to them by a Classical digital Process-control Computer
(CPC); in this way instruments are distinguished from quantum-mechanical models
(sets of equations) that specify what is desired of the instruments. Results
include: (1) a formulation of quantum mechanics adapted to computer-controlled
instruments; (2) a lower bound on the precision of unitary transforms required
for quantum searching and a lower bound on sample size needed to show that
instruments implement a desired model at that precision; (3) a lower bound on
precision of timing required of a CPC in directing instruments; (4) a
demonstration that guesswork is necessary in ratcheting up the precision of
commands.
