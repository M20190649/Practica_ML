Improved two-party and multi-party purification protocols
We present an improved protocol for entanglement purification of bipartite
mixed states using several states at a time rather than two at a time as in the
traditional recurrence method. We also present a generalization of the hashing
method to n-partite cat states, which achieves a finite yield of pure cat
states for any desired fidelity. Our results are compared to previous
protocols.
