On the solution of the EPR paradox and the explanation of the violation
  of Bell's inequality
A new interpretation offers a consistent conceptual basis for nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is solved and the
violation of Bell's inequality is explained by maintaining realism, inductive
inference and Einstein separability.
