The doublet of Dirac fermions in the field of the non-Abelian monopole,
  isotopic chiral symmetry, and parity selection rules
The paper concerns a problem of the Dirac fermion doublet in the external
monopole potential obtained by embedding the Abelian monopole solution in the
non-Abelian scheme. In this case, the doublet-monopole Hamiltonian is invariant
under operations consisting of a complex and one parametric Abelian subgroup in
S0(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain freedom in choosing a discrete
operator N(A) (A is a complex number) entering the complete set of quantum
variables. The same complex number A represents an additional parameter at the
basis functions. The generalized inversion like operator N(A) affords certain
generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. All the different sets of basis
functions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. The functions Psi(A)
decompose into linear combinations of Psi(A=0): Psi(A) = F(A) Psi(A=0).
However, the bases considered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones when A is a
complex number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy of the N(A)
at complex A-s. The meaning of possibility to violate the quantum-mechanical
regulation on self-conjugacy as regards the operator N(A) is discussed. Also,
the problem of possible physical status for the matrix F(A) at real A-s is
considered in full detail: since the matrix belongs formally to the gauge group
SU(2), but being a symmetry for the Hamiltonian this F(A) generates linear
transformations on basis wave functions.
