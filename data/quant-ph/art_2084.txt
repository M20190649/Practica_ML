Geometric Phases for Three State Systems
The adiabatic geometric phases for general three state systems are discussed.
An explicit parameterization for space of states of these systems is given. The
abelian and non-abelian connection one-forms or vector potentials that would
appear in a three dimensional quantum system with adiabatic characteristics are
given explicitly. This is done in terms of the Euler angle parameterization of
SU(3) which enables a straight-forward calculation of these quantities and its
immediate generalization.
