Quantum computation with mesoscopic superposition states
We present a strategy to engineer a simple cavity-QED two-bit universal
quantum gate using mesoscopic distinct quantum superposition states. The
dissipative effect on decoherence and amplitude damping of the quantum bits are
analyzed and the critical parameters are presented.
