Bell's theorem with and without inequalities for the three-qubit
  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states
A proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities valid for both inequivalent
classes of three-qubit entangled states under local operations assisted by
classical communication, namely Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W, is
described. This proof leads to a Bell inequality that allows more conclusive
tests of Bell's theorem for three-qubit systems. Another Bell inequality
involving both tri- and bipartite correlations is introduced which illustrates
the different violations of local realism exhibited by the GHZ and W states.
