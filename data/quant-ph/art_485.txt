Locality and Causality in Hidden Variables Models of Quantum Theory
Motivated by Popescu's example of hidden nonlocality, we elaborate on the
conjecture that quantum states that are intuitively nonlocal, i.e., entangled,
do not admit a local causal hidden variables model. We exhibit quantum states
which either (i) are nontrivial counterexamples to this conjecture or (ii)
possess a new kind of more deeply hidden irreducible nonlocality. Moreover, we
propose a nonlocality complexity classification scheme suggested by the latter
possibility. Furthermore, we show that Werner's (and similar) hidden variables
models can be extended to an important class of generalized observables.
Finally a result of Fine on the equivalence of stochastic and deterministic
hidden variables is generalized to causal models.
