On the Complexity of Quantum Searching Using Complex Queries
We discuss the quantum search algorithm using complex queries that has
recently been published by Grover (quant-ph/9706005). We recall the algorithm
adding some details showing which complex query has to be evaluated. Based on
this version of the algorithm we discuss its complexity.
