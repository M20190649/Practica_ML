Time-convolutionless reduced-density-operator theory of a noisy quantum
  channel: a two-bit quantum gate for quantum information processing
An exact reduced-density-operator for the output quantum states in
time-convolutionless form was derived by solving the quantum Liouville equation
which governs the dynamics of a noisy quantum channel by using a projection
operator method and both advanced and retarded propagators in time. The
formalism developed in this work is general enough to model a noisy quantum
channel provided specific forms of the Hamiltonians for the system, reservoir,
and the mutual interaction between the system and the reservoir are given.
Then, we apply the formulation to model a two-bit quantum gate composed of
coupled spin systems in which the Heisenberg coupling is controlled by the
tunneling barrier between neighboring quantum dots. Gate Characteristics
including the entropy, fidelity, and purity are calculated numerically for both
mixed and entangled initial states.
