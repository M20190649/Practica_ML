Optimally shaped terahertz pulses for phase retrieval in a Rydberg atom
  data register
We employ Optimal Control Theory to discover an efficient information
retrieval algorithm that can be performed on a Rydberg atom data register using
a shaped terahertz pulse. The register is a Rydberg wave packet with one
consituent orbital phase-reversed from the others (the ``marked bit''). The
terahertz pulse that performs the decoding algorithm does so by by driving
electron probability density into the marked orbital. Its shape is calculated
by modifying the target of an optimal control problem so that it represents the
direct product of all correct solutions to the algorithm.
