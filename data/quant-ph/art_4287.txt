Role of degenerate atomic levels in the entanglement and the decoherence
We studied the dispersive dissipation of denegerate-level atom interacting
with a single linearly-polarized mode field. It is found that the degeneracy of
the atomic level affects the dissipation bahavior of the system as well as the
subsystems. The degeneracy of the atomic level augment the periods of
entanglement and increase the degree of the maxima statistical mixture states.
