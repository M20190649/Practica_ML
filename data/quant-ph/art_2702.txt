NMR quantum computation with indirectly coupled gates
An NMR realization of a two-qubit quantum gate which processes quantum
information indirectly via couplings to a spectator qubit is presented in the
context of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. This enables a successful comprehensive
NMR implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for functions with three
argument bits and demonstrates a technique essential for multi-qubit quantum
computation.
