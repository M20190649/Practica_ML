Interaction-Free Measurement applied to Quantum Computation: a New CNOT
  Gate
In this paper, we propose a new direction of research for the realization of
the quantum controlled-not gate based on a technique called ``interaction-free
measurement'', where qubits are two-level atoms (or ions) and information is
mediated from one qubit to another by lasers in superpositions of $\pi$ and
$2\pi$ pulses. We investigate the advantages and limitations of such a gate and
discuss possible applicability.
