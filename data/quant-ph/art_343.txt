Coherent State Quantization of Constraint Systems
A careful reexamination of the quantization of systems with first- and
second-class constraints from the point of view of coherent-state phase-space
path integration reveals several significant distinctions from more
conventional treatments. Most significantly, we emphasize the importance of
using path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers which ensure that the
quantum system satisfies the quantum constraint conditions. Our procedures
involve no delta-functionals of the classical constraints, no need for gauge
fixing of first-class constraints, no need to eliminate second-class
constraints, no potentially ambiguous determinants, and have the virtue of
resolving differences between canonical and path-integral approaches. Several
examples are considered in detail.
