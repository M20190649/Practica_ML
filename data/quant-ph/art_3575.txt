Objective probabilities, quantum counterfactuals, and the ABL rule
The ABL rule is derived as a tool of standard quantum mechanics. The
ontological significance of the existence of objective probabilities is
discussed. Objections by Kastner and others to counterfactual uses of the ABL
rule are refuted. Metaphysical presumptions leading to such views as Kastner is
defending in her Comment are examined and shown to be unwarranted.
