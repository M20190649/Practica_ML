Automated 'plug & play' quantum key distribution
An improved "plug & play" interferometric system for quantum key distribution
is presented. Self-alignment and compensation of birefringence remain, while
limitations due to reflections are overcome. Original electronics implementing
the BB84 protocol makes adjustment simple. Key creation with 0.1 photon per
pulse at a rate of 325 Hz with a 2.9 percent QBER - corresponding to a net rate
of 210Hz - over a 23 Km installed cable was performed.
