Novel Cascaded Ultra Bright Pulsed Source of Polarization Entangled
  Photons
A new ultra bright pulsed source of polarization entangled photons has been
realized using type-II phase matching in spontaneous parametric down conversion
process in two cascaded crystals. The optical axes of the crystals are aligned
in such a way that the extraordinarily (ordinarily) polarized cone from one
crystal overlaps with the ordinarily (extraordinarily) polarized cone from the
second crystal. This spatial overlapping removes the association between the
polarization and the output angle of the photons that exist in a single type-II
down conversion process. Hence, entanglement of photons originating from any
point on the output cones is possible if a suitable optical delay line is used.
This delay line is particularly simple and easy to implement.
