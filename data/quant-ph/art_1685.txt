Copying of entangled states and the degradation of correlations
We investigate the degree to which entanglement survives when a correlated
pair of two-state systems are copied using either local or non-local processes.
We show how the copying process degrades the entanglement, due to a residual
correlation between the copied output and the copying machine (itself made of
qubits).
