Ipso-information-transfer
A tripartite system with entangled non-orthogonal states is used to transfer
retrievable or usable information without requiring an external channel,
ipso-information-transfer (IIT). The non-Schmidt decomposable entanglement
couples two independent interactions through which the information is
transferred between a pair of non-interacting components of the system. We
outline a dynamical model of IIT using localised particles. Implications for
quantum nonlocality are raised.
