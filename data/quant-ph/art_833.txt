Asymptotic State Vector Collapse and QED Nonequivalent Representations
The state vector evolution in the interaction of measured pure state with the
collective quantum system or the field is analyzed in a nonperturbative QED
formalism. As the model example the measurement of the electron final state
scattered on nucleus or neutrino is considered. The produced electromagnetic
bremsstrahlung contains the unrestricted number of soft photons resulting in
the total radiation flux becoming the classical observable, which means the
state vector collapse. The evolution from the initial to the final system state
is nonunitary and formally irreversible in the limit of the infinite time.
