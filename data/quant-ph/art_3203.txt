Single Atoms in an Optical Dipole Trap: Towards a Deterministic Source
  of Cold Atoms
We describe a simple experimental technique which allows us to store a small
and deterministic number of neutral atoms in an optical dipole trap. The
desired atom number is prepared in a magneto-optical trap overlapped with a
single focused Nd:YAG laser beam. Dipole trap loading efficiency of 100 % and
storage times of about one minute have been achieved. We have also prepared
atoms in a certain hyperfine state and demonstrated the feasibility of a
state-selective detection via resonance fluorescence at the level of a few
neutral atoms. A spin relaxation time of the polarized sample of $4.2\pm 0.7$ s
has been measured. Possible applications are briefly discussed.
