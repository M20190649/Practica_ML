Comment on testing Bell's inequality with Rydberg atoms entangled
  through cavity photons
Rydberg atoms traversing a micromaser cavity one after the other can emerge
in correlated states, and according to Copenhagen quantum mechanics this may
lead to a violation of Bell's inequality, that is, to a Bell sum S>2. S is here
calculated in various ideal physical situations including those with (1)
different initial states of the atoms, (2) different free adjustable
parameters, being either the phase or the turning angle of a classical
radiation field put behind the cavity, and (3) either equal or different Rabi
angles for successive atoms. The experiments are crucial for a realist
interpretation which predicts S<2 or S=2 because particles of different kinds
(photons and atoms) are involved.
