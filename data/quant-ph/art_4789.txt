Transformations of q-boson and q-fermion algebras
We investigate the algebras satisfied by q-deformed boson and fermion
oscillators, in particular the transformations of the algebra from one form to
another. Based on a specific algebra proposed in recent literature, we show
that the algebra of deformed fermions can be transformed to that of undeformed
standard fermions. Furthermore we also show that the algebra of q-deformed
fermions can be transformed to that of undeformed standard bosons.
