Time Dependent Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics
The well-known supersymmetric constructions such as Witten's supersymmetric
quantum mechanics, Spiridonov-Rubakov parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics, and
higher-derivative SUSY of Andrianov et al. are extended to the nonstationary
Schr\"odinger equation. All these constructions are based on the time-dependent
Darboux transformation. The superalgebra over the conventional Lie algebra is
constructed. Examples of time-dependent exactly solvable potentials are given.
