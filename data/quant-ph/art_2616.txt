Continuity bounds for entanglement
This note quantifies the continuity properties of entanglement: how much does
entanglement vary if we change the entangled quantum state just a little? This
question is studied for the pure state entanglement of a bipartite system and
for the entanglement of formation of a bipartite system in a mixed state.
