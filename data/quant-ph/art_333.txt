Quantum data processing and error correction
This paper investigates properties of noisy quantum information channels. We
define a new quantity called {\em coherent information} which measures the
amount of quantum information conveyed in the noisy channel. This quantity can
never be increased by quantum information processing, and it yields a simple
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of perfect quantum error
correction.
