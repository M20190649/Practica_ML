A note on bound entanglement and local realism
We show using a numerical approach that gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of local realism, that the bound entangled state
presented in Bennett et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385 (1999) admits a local
and realistic description. We also find the lowest possible amount of some
appropriate entangled state that must be ad-mixed to the bound entangled state
so that the resulting density operator has no local and realistic description
and as such can be useful in quantum communication and quantum computation.
