Strong coupling theory for driven tunneling and vibrational relaxation
We investigate on a unified basis tunneling and vibrational relaxation in
driven dissipative multistable systems described by their N lowest lying
unperturbed levels. By use of the discrete variable representation we derive a
set of coupled non-Markovian master equations. We present analytical treatments
that describe the dynamics in the regime of strong system-bath coupling. Our
findings are corroborated by ``ab-initio'' real-time path integral
calculations.
