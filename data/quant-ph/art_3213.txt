The Representation of Natural Numbers in Quantum Mechanics
This paper represents one approach to making explicit some of the assumptions
and conditions implied in the widespread representation of numbers by composite
quantum systems. Any nonempty set and associated operations is a set of natural
numbers or a model of arithmetic if the set and operations satisfy the axioms
of number theory or arithmetic. This work is limited to k-ary representations
of length L and to the axioms for arithmetic modulo k^{L}. A model of the
axioms is described based on states in and operators on an abstract L fold
tensor product Hilbert space H^{arith}. Unitary maps of this space onto a
physical parameter based product space H^{phy} are then described. Each of
these maps makes states in H^{phy}, and the induced operators, a model of the
axioms. Consequences of the existence of many of these maps are discussed along
with the dependence of Grover's and Shor's Algorithms on these maps. The
importance of the main physical requirement, that the basic arithmetic
operations are efficiently implementable, is discussed. This conditions states
that there exist physically realizable Hamiltonians that can implement the
basic arithmetic operations and that the space-time and thermodynamic resources
required are polynomial in L.
