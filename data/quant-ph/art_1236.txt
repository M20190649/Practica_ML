What is quantum mechanics trying to tell us?
I explore whether it is possible to make sense of the quantum mechanical
description of physical reality by taking the proper subject of physics to be
correlation and only correlation, and by separating the problem of
understanding the nature of quantum mechanics from the hard problem of
understanding the nature of objective probability in individual systems, and
the even harder problem of understanding the nature of conscious awareness. The
resulting perspective on quantum mechanics is supported by some elementary but
insufficiently emphasized theorems. Whether or not it is adequate as a new
Weltanschauung, this point of view toward quantum mechanics provides a
different perspective from which to teach the subject or explain its peculiar
character to people in other fields.
