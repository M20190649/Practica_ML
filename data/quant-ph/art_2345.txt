Supersymmetry of a spin 1/2 particle on the real line
We study one dimensional supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics of a spin
1/2 particle moving in a rotating magnetic field and scalar potential. We also
discuss SUSY breaking and it is shown that SUSY breaking essentially depends on
the strength and period of the magnetic field. For a purely rotating magnetic
field the eigenvalue problem is solved exactly and two band energy spectrum is
found.
