Levinson theorem in two dimensions
A two-dimensional analogue of Levinson's theorem for nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics is established, which relates the phase shift at threshold(zero
momentum) for the $m$th partial wave to the total number of bound states with
angular momentum $m\hbar(m=0,1,2,...)$ in an attractive central field.
