Non-Interacting Fermions in a One-Dimensional Harmonic Atom Trap: Exact
  One-Particle Properties at Zero Temperature
One-particle properties of non-interacting Fermions in a one-dimensional
harmonic trap and at zero temperature are studied. Exact expressions and
asymptotic results for large Fermion number N are given for the particle
density distribution n_0(z,N). For large N and near the classical boundary at
the Fermi energy the density displays increasing fluctuations. A simple scaling
of these tails of the density distribution with respect to N is established.
The Fourier transform of the density distribution is calculated exactly. It
displays a small but characteristic hump near 2 k_F with k_F being a properly
defined Fermi wave number. This is due to Friedel oscillations which are
identified and discussed. These quantum effects are missing in the
semi-classical approximation. Momentum distributions are also evaluated and
discussed. As an example of a time-dependent one-particle problem we calculate
exactly the evolution of the particle density when the trap is suddenly
switched off and find a simple scaling behaviour in agreement with recent
general results.
