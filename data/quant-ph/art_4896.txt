Decoherence for classically chaotic quantum maps
We study the behavior of an open quantum system, with an $N$--dimensional
space of states, whose density matrix evolves according to a non--unitary map
defined in two steps: A unitary step, where the system evolves with an
evolution operator obtained by quantizing a classically chaotic map (baker's
and Harper's map are the two examples we consider). A non--unitary step where
the evolution operator for the density matrix mimics the effect of diffusion in
the semiclassical (large $N$) limit. The process of decoherence and the
transition from quantum to classical behavior are analyzed in detail by means
of numerical and analitic tools. The existence of a regime where the entropy
grows with a rate which is independent of the strength of the diffusion
coefficient is demonstrated. The nature of the processes that determine the
production of entropy is analyzed.
