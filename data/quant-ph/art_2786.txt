Mirrorless oscillation based on resonantly enhanced 4-wave mixing:
  All-order analytic solutions
The phase transition to mirrorless oscillation in resonantly enhanced
four-wave mixing in double-$\Lambda$ systems are studied analytically for the
ideal case of infinite lifetimes of ground-state coherences. The stationary
susceptibilities are obtained in all orders of the generated fields and
analytic solutions of the coupled nonlinear differential equations for the
field amplitudes are derived and discussed.
