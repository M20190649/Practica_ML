Building partially entangled states with Grover's amplitude
  amplification process
We discuss how to build some partially entangled states of $n$ two-state
quantum systems (qubits). The optimal partially entangled state with a high
degree of symmetry is considered to be useful for overcoming a shot noise limit
of Ramsey spectroscopy under some decoherence. This state is invariant under
permutation of any two qubits and inversion between the ground state $|0\ket$
and an excited state $|1\ket$ for each qubit. We show that using selective
phase shifts in certain basis vectors and Grover's inversion about average
operations, we can construct this high symmetric entangled state by
$({polynomial in $n$})\times 2^{n/2}$ successive unitary transformations that
are applied on two or three qubits. We can apply our method to build more
general entangled states.
