Quantum noise in optical fibers II: Raman jitter in soliton
  communications
The dynamics of a soliton propagating in a single-mode optical fiber with
gain, loss, and Raman coupling to thermal phonons is analyzed. Using both
soliton perturbation theory and exact numerical techniques, we predict that
intrinsic thermal quantum noise from the phonon reservoirs is a larger source
of jitter and other perturbations than the gain-related Gordon-Haus noise, for
short pulses, assuming typical fiber parameters. The size of the Raman timing
jitter is evaluated for both bright and dark (topological) solitons, and is
larger for bright solitons. Because Raman thermal quantum noise is a nonlinear,
multiplicative noise source, these effects are stronger for the more intense
pulses needed to propagate as solitons in the short-pulse regime. Thus Raman
noise may place additional limitations on fiber-optical communications and
networking using ultrafast (subpicosecond) pulses.
