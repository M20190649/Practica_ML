On the Problem of Programming Quantum Computers
We study effects of the physical realization of quantum computers on their
logical operation. Through simulation of physical models of quantum computer
hardware, we analyse the difficulties that are encountered in programming
physical implementations of quantum computers. We discuss the origin of the
instabilities of quantum algorithms and explore physical mechanisms to enlarge
the region(s) of stable operation.
