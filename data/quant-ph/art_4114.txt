Quantum Zeno tomography
We show that the resolution "per absorbed particle" of standard absorption
tomography can be outperformed by a simple interferometric setup, provided that
the different levels of "gray" in the sample are not uniformly distributed. The
technique hinges upon the quantum Zeno effect and has been tested in numerical
simulations. The scheme we propose could be implemented in experiments with
UV-light, neutrons or X-rays.
