Quantum Holography
We propose to make use of quantum entanglement for extracting holographic
information about a remote 3-D object in a confined space which light enters,
but from which it cannot escape. Light scattered from the object is detected in
this confined space entirely without the benefit of spatial resolution. Quantum
holography offers this possibility by virtue of the fourth-order quantum
coherence inherent in entangled beams.
