Thermal noise of a plano-convex mirror
We study theoretically the internal thermal noise of a mirror coated on a
plano-convex substrate. The comparison with a cylindrical mirror of the same
mass shows that the effect on a light beam can be reduced by a factor 10,
improving the sensitivity of high-precision optical experiments such as
gravitational-wave interferometers.
