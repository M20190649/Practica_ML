Violation of Bell inequalities by photons more than 10 km apart
A Franson-type test of Bell inequalities by photons 10.9 km apart is
presented. Energy-time entangled photon-pairs are measured using two-channel
analyzers, leading to a violation of the inequalities by 16 standard deviations
without subtracting accidental coincidences. Subtracting them, a 2-photon
interference visibility of 95.5% is observed, demonstrating that distances up
to 10 km have no significant effect on entanglement. This sets quantum
cryptography with photon pairs as a practical competitor to the schemes based
on weak pulses.
