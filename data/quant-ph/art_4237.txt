Electron State Entanglement at Double Ionization
Electron wave function entanglement and spin reconfiguration as source of
electron correlation are investigated. Properties of correlation function are
shown to have the best concordance with experimental data under supposition
that probability of change of electron state to triplet state is about 0.5 or
more.
