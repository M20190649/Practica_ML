Geometry of entangled states
Geometric properties of the set of quantum entangled states are investigated.
We propose an explicit method to compute the dimension of local orbits for any
mixed state of the general K x M problem and characterize the set of
effectively different states (which cannot be related by local
transformations). Thus we generalize earlier results obtained for the simplest
2 x 2 system, which lead to a stratification of the 6D set of N=4 pure states.
We define the concept of absolutely separable states, for which all globally
equivalent states are separable.
