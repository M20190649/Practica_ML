Applications of a Simple Formula
New applications of the formula $A |\psi\rangle = \langle A \rangle
|\psi\rangle + \Delta A |\psi_{\perp} \rangle$ are discussed. Simple
derivations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and of related inequalities
are presented. In addition, the formula is used in an instructive paradox which
clarifies a fundamental notion in quantum mechanics.
