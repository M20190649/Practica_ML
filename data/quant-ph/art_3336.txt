Entanglements and compound states in quantum information theory
Quantum entanglements, describing truly quantum couplings, are stu died and
classified from the point of view of quantum compound states. We show that c
lassical-quantum correspondences such as quantum encodings can be treated as
d-entanglements leading to a special class of the separable compound states.
The mutual information of the d-compound and entangled states lead to two di
fferent types of entropies for a given quantum state: the von Neumann entrop y,
which is achieved as the supremum of the information over all d-entanglem ents,
and the dimensional entropy, which is achieved at the standard entangl ement,
the true quantum entanglement, coinciding with a d-entanglement only in the
commutative case. The q-capacity of a quantum noiseless channel, defi ned as
the supremum over all entanglements, is given as the logarithm of the
dimensionality of the input von Neumann algebra. It can double the classical
capacity, achieved as the supremum over all semi-quantum couplings (d-entang
lements, or encodings), which is bounded by the logarithm of the dimensional
ity of a maximal Abelian subalgebra.
