Decoherence and fluctuations in quantum interference experiments
We analyze the notion of quantum coherence in an interference experiment. We
let the phase shifts fluctuate according to a given statistical distribution
and introduce a decoherence parameter, defined in terms of a generalized
visibility of the interference pattern. One might naively expect that a
particle ensemble suffers a greater loss of quantum coherence by interacting
with an increasingly randomized distribution of shifts. As we shall see, this
is not always true.
