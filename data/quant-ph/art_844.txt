New variants of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem
We discuss two new demonstrations of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem: a
state-independent proof using 14 four-dimensional propositions, based on a
suggestion made by Clifton, and a state-specific proof involving 5 propositions
on the singlet state of two spin-1/2 particles.
