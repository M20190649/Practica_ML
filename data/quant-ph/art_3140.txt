Dynamical Generation of Noiseless Quantum Subsystems
We present control schemes for open quantum systems that combine decoupling
and universal control methods with coding procedures. By exploiting a general
algebraic approach, we show how appropriate encodings of quantum states result
in obtaining universal control over dynamically-generated noise-protected
subsystems with limited control resources. In particular, we provide an
efficient scheme for performing universal encoded quantum computation in a wide
class of systems subjected to linear non-Markovian quantum noise and supporting
Heisenberg-type internal Hamiltonians.
