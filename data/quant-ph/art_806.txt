Quantum state manipulation of trapped atomic ions
A single laser-cooled and trapped 9Be+ ion is used to investigate methods of
coherent quantum-state synthesis and quantum logic. We create and characterize
nonclassical states of motion including "Schroedinger-cat" states. A
fundamental quantum logic gate is realized which uses two states of the
quantized ion motion and two ion internal states as qubits. We explore some of
the applications for, and problems in realizing, quantum computation based on
multiple trapped ions.
