Subtraction of ``accidentals'' and the validity of Bell tests
In some key Bell experiments, including two of the well-known ones by Alain
Aspect, 1981-2, it is only after the subtraction of ``accidentals'' from the
coincidence counts that we get violations of Bell tests. The data adjustment,
producing increases of up to 60% in the test statistics, has never been
adequately justified. Few published experiments give sufficient information for
the reader to make a fair assessment. There is a straightforward and well known
realist model that fits the unadjusted data very well. In this paper, the logic
of this realist model and the reasoning used by experimenters in justification
of the data adjustment are discussed. It is concluded that the evidence from
all Bell experiments is in urgent need of re-assessment, in the light of all
the known ``loopholes''. Invalid Bell tests have frequently been used,
neglecting improved ones derived by Clauser and Horne in 1974. ``Local causal''
explanations for the observations have been wrongfully neglected.
