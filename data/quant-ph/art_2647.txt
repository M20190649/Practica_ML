Simulations of Quantum Logic Operations in Quantum Computer with Large
  Number of Qubits
We report the first simulations of the dynamics of quantum logic operations
with a large number of qubits (up to 1000). A nuclear spin chain in which
selective excitations of spins is provided by the gradient of the external
magnetic field is considered. The spins interact with their nearest neighbors.
We simulate the quantum control-not (CN) gate implementation for remote qubits
which provides the long-distance entanglement. Our approach can be applied to
any implementation of quantum logic gates involving a large number of qubits.
