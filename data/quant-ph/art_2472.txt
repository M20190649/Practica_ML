Approximate real time visualization of a Rabi transition by means of
  continuous fuzzy measurement
Continuous weak or fuzzy measurement of the Rabi oscillation of a two level
atom subjected to a $\pi-$pulse of a resonant light field is simulated
numerically. We thereby address the question whether it is possible to measure
characteristic features of the motion of the state of a single quantum system
in real time. We compare two schemes of continuous measurement: continuous
measurement with constant fuzziness and with fuzziness changing in the course
of the measurement. Because the sensitivity of the Rabi atom to the influence
of the measurement depends on the state of the atom, it is possible to optimize
the continuous fuzzy measurement by varying its fuzziness.
