Change of Variable as Borel Resummation of Semiclassical Series
It is shown that a change of variable in 1-dim Schroedinger equation applied
to the Borel summable fundamental solutions [Giller] is equivalent to Borel
resummation of the fundamental solutions multiplied by suitably chosen
$\hbar$-dependent constant. This explains why change of variable can improve
JWKB formulae [Giller, Milczarski]. It is shown also that a change of variable
alone cannot provide us with the exact JWKB formulae.
