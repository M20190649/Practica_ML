Approximate quantum error correction can lead to better codes
We present relaxed criteria for quantum error correction which are useful
when the specific dominant noise process is known. These criteria have no
classical analogue. As an example, we provide a four-bit code which corrects
for a single amplitude damping error. This code violates the usual Hamming
bound calculated for a Pauli description of the error process, and does not fit
into the GF(4) classification.
