Quantum jumps in hydrogen-like systems
In this paper it is shown that the Lyman-$\alpha$ transition of a single
hydrogen-like system driven by a laser exhibits macroscopic dark periods,
provided there exists an additional constant electric field. We describe the
photon-counting process under the condition that the polarization of the laser
coincides with the direction of the constant electric field. The theoretical
results are given for the example of $^4{He}^+$. We show that the emission
behavior depends sensitively on the Lamb shift (W.E. Lamb, R.C. Retherford,
Phys. Rev. 72, 241 (1947)) between the $2s_{1/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$ energy levels.
A possibly realizable measurement of the mean duration of the dark periods
should give quantitative information about the above energy difference by using
the proposed photon-counting process.
