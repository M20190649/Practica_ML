Experimental Test of Relativistic Quantum State Collapse with Moving
  Reference Frames
An experimental test of relativistic wave-packet collapse is presented. The
tested model assumes that the collapse takes place in the reference frame
determined by the massive measuring detectors. Entangled photons are measured
at 10 km distance within a time interval of less than 5 ps. The two apparatuses
are in relative motion so that both detectors, each in its own inertial
reference frame, are first to perform the measurement. The data always
reproduces the quantum correlations and thus rule out a class of collapse
models. The results also set a lower bound on the "speed of quantum
information" to 0.66 x 10^7 and 1.5 x 10^4 times the speed of light in the
Geneva and the background radiation reference frames, respectively. The very
difficult and deep question of where the collapse takes place - if it takes
place at all - is considered in a concrete experimental context.
