Data-Driven Learning of a Union of Sparsifying Transforms Model for
  Blind Compressed Sensing
Compressed sensing is a powerful tool in applications such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). It enables accurate recovery of images from highly
undersampled measurements by exploiting the sparsity of the images or image
patches in a transform domain or dictionary. In this work, we focus on blind
compressed sensing (BCS), where the underlying sparse signal model is a priori
unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying
image as well as the unknown model from highly undersampled measurements.
Specifically, our model is that the patches of the underlying image(s) are
approximately sparse in a transform domain. We also extend this model to a
union of transforms model that better captures the diversity of features in
natural images. The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithms for blind
compressed sensing are highly efficient, and are guaranteed to converge to at
least the partial global and partial local minimizers of the highly non-convex
BCS problems. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed framework
usually leads to better quality of image reconstructions in MRI compared to
several recent image reconstruction methods. Importantly, the learning of a
union of sparsifying transforms leads to better image reconstructions than a
single adaptive transform.
