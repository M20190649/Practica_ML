Efficient hierarchical clustering for continuous data
We present an new sequential Monte Carlo sampler for coalescent based
Bayesian hierarchical clustering. Our model is appropriate for modeling
non-i.i.d. data and offers a substantial reduction of computational cost when
compared to the original sampler without resorting to approximations. We also
propose a quadratic complexity approximation that in practice shows almost no
loss in performance compared to its counterpart. We show that as a byproduct of
our formulation, we obtain a greedy algorithm that exhibits performance
improvement over other greedy algorithms, particularly in small data sets. In
order to exploit the correlation structure of the data, we describe how to
incorporate Gaussian process priors in the model as a flexible way to model
non-i.i.d. data. Results on artificial and real data show significant
improvements over closely related approaches.
