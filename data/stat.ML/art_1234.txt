Practical Coreset Constructions for Machine Learning
We investigate coresets - succinct, small summaries of large data sets - so
that solutions found on the summary are provably competitive with solution
found on the full data set. We provide an overview over the state-of-the-art in
coreset construction for machine learning. In Section 2, we present both the
intuition behind and a theoretically sound framework to construct coresets for
general problems and apply it to $k$-means clustering. In Section 3 we
summarize existing coreset construction algorithms for a variety of machine
learning problems such as maximum likelihood estimation of mixture models,
Bayesian non-parametric models, principal component analysis, regression and
general empirical risk minimization.
