Roll-back Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
We propose a new framework for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on truncated
probability distributions with smooth underlying density functions. Traditional
HMC requires computing the gradient of potential function associated with the
target distribution, and therefore does not perform its full power on truncated
distributions due to lack of continuity and differentiability. In our
framework, we introduce a sharp sigmoid factor in the density function to
approximate the probability drop at the truncation boundary. The target
potential function is approximated by a new potential which smoothly extends to
the entire sample space. HMC is then performed on the approximate potential.
While our method is easy to implement and applies to a wide range of problems,
it also achieves comparable computational efficiency on various sampling tasks
compared to other baseline methods. RBHMC also gives rise to a new approach for
Bayesian inference on constrained spaces.
