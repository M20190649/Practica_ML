On Fairness, Diversity and Randomness in Algorithmic Decision Making
Consider a binary decision making process where a single machine learning
classifier replaces a multitude of humans. We raise questions about the
resulting loss of diversity in the decision making process. We study the
potential benefits of using random classifier ensembles instead of a single
classifier in the context of fairness-aware learning and demonstrate various
attractive properties: (i) an ensemble of fair classifiers is guaranteed to be
fair, for several different measures of fairness, (ii) an ensemble of unfair
classifiers can still achieve fair outcomes, and (iii) an ensemble of
classifiers can achieve better accuracy-fairness trade-offs than a single
classifier. Finally, we introduce notions of distributional fairness to
characterize further potential benefits of random classifier ensembles.
