Locally Adaptive Dynamic Networks
Our focus is on realistically modeling and forecasting dynamic networks of
face-to-face contacts among individuals. Important aspects of such data that
lead to problems with current methods include the tendency of the contacts to
move between periods of slow and rapid changes, and the dynamic heterogeneity
in the actors' connectivity behaviors. Motivated by this application, we
develop a novel method for Locally Adaptive DYnamic (LADY) network inference.
The proposed model relies on a dynamic latent space representation in which
each actor's position evolves in time via stochastic differential equations.
Using a state space representation for these stochastic processes and
P\'olya-gamma data augmentation, we develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for
posterior inference along with tractable procedures for online updating and
forecasting of future networks. We evaluate performance in simulation studies,
and consider an application to face-to-face contacts among individuals in a
primary school.
