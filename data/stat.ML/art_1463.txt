From Distance Correlation to Multiscale Graph Correlation
Understanding and developing a correlation measure that can detect general
dependencies is not only imperative to statistics and machine learning, but
also crucial to general scientific discovery in the big data age. In this
paper, we establish a new framework that generalizes distance correlation --- a
correlation measure that was recently proposed and shown to be universally
consistent for dependence testing against all joint distributions of finite
moments --- to the Multiscale Graph Correlation (MGC). By utilizing the
characteristic functions and incorporating the nearest neighbor machinery, we
formalize the population version of local distance correlations, define the
optimal scale in a given dependency, and name the optimal local correlation as
MGC. The new theoretical framework motivates a theoretically sound Sample MGC
and allows a number of desirable properties to be proved, including the
universal consistency, convergence and almost unbiasedness of the sample
version. The advantages of MGC are illustrated via a comprehensive set of
simulations with linear, nonlinear, univariate, multivariate, and noisy
dependencies, where it loses almost no power in monotone dependencies while
achieving better performance in general dependencies, compared to distance
correlation and other popular methods.
