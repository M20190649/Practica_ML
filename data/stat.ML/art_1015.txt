Sparse Generalized Eigenvalue Problem: Optimal Statistical Rates via
  Truncated Rayleigh Flow
Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) plays a pivotal role in a large
family of high-dimensional statistical models, including sparse Fisher's
discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension
reduction. Sparse GEP involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. Most
existing methods and theory in the context of specific statistical models that
are special cases of the sparse GEP require restrictive structural assumptions
on the input matrices. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational
framework to solve the sparse GEP. At the first stage, we solve a convex
relaxation of the sparse GEP. Taking the solution as an initial value, we then
exploit a nonconvex optimization perspective and propose the truncated Rayleigh
flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector. We show
that Rifle converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate
of convergence for many statistical models. Theoretically, our method
significantly improves upon the existing literature by eliminating structural
assumptions on the input matrices for both stages. To achieve this, our
analysis involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient based
method on nonconvex objective functions, and (ii) a fine-grained
characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path.
Thorough numerical studies are provided to validate the theoretical results.
