Clustering on the Edge: Learning Structure in Graphs
With the recent popularity of graphical clustering methods, there has been an
increased focus on the information between samples. We show how learning
cluster structure using edge features naturally and simultaneously determines
the most likely number of clusters and addresses data scale issues. These
results are particularly useful in instances where (a) there are a large number
of clusters and (b) we have some labeled edges. Applications in this domain
include image segmentation, community discovery and entity resolution. Our
model is an extension of the planted partition model and our solution uses
results of correlation clustering, which achieves a partition O(log(n))-close
to the log-likelihood of the true clustering.
