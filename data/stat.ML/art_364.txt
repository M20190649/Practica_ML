Outlier robust system identification: a Bayesian kernel-based approach
In this paper, we propose an outlier-robust regularized kernel-based method
for linear system identification. The unknown impulse response is modeled as a
zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently
proposed stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and
exponential stability. To build robustness to outliers, we model the
measurement noise as realizations of independent Laplacian random variables.
The identification problem is cast in a Bayesian framework, and solved by a new
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. In particular, exploiting the
representation of the Laplacian random variables as scale mixtures of
Gaussians, we design a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target
distribution. Numerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the
accuracy of the estimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods.
