Quantile universal threshold: model selection at the detection edge for
  high-dimensional linear regression
To estimate a sparse linear model from data with Gaussian noise, consilience
from lasso and compressed sensing literatures is that thresholding estimators
like lasso and the Dantzig selector have the ability in some situations to
identify with high probability part of the significant covariates
asymptotically, and are numerically tractable thanks to convexity.
  Yet, the selection of a threshold parameter $\lambda$ remains crucial in
practice. To that aim we propose Quantile Universal Thresholding, a selection
of $\lambda$ at the detection edge. We show with extensive simulations and real
data that an excellent compromise between high true positive rate and low false
discovery rate is achieved, leading also to good predictive risk.
