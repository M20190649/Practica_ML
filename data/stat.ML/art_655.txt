Clustering of Modal Valued Symbolic Data
Symbolic Data Analysis is based on special descriptions of data - symbolic
objects (SO). Such descriptions preserve more detailed information about units
and their clusters than the usual representations with mean values. A special
kind of symbolic object is a representation with frequency or probability
distributions (modal values). This representation enables us to consider in the
clustering process the variables of all measurement types at the same time. In
the paper a clustering criterion function for SOs is proposed such that the
representative of each cluster is again composed of distributions of variables'
values over the cluster. The corresponding leaders clustering method is based
on this result. It is also shown that for the corresponding agglomerative
hierarchical method a generalized Ward's formula holds. Both methods are
compatible - they are solving the same clustering optimization problem. The
leaders method efficiently solves clustering problems with large number of
units; while the agglomerative method can be applied alone on the smaller data
set, or it could be applied on leaders, obtained with compatible
nonhierarchical clustering method. Such a combination of two compatible methods
enables us to decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the
corresponding dendrogram. The proposed methods were applied on different data
sets. In the paper, some results of clustering of ESS data are presented.
