Household poverty classification in data-scarce environments: a machine
  learning approach
We describe a method to identify poor households in data-scarce countries by
leveraging information contained in nationally representative household
surveys. It employs standard statistical learning techniques---cross-validation
and parameter regularization---which together reduce the extent to which the
model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey data. The
automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development
setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the
costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed
to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after
data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the
model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that
may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data
from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households
from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.
