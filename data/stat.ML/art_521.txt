Innovated interaction screening for high-dimensional nonlinear
  classification
This paper is concerned with the problems of interaction screening and
nonlinear classification in a high-dimensional setting. We propose a two-step
procedure, IIS-SQDA, where in the first step an innovated interaction screening
(IIS) approach based on transforming the original $p$-dimensional feature
vector is proposed, and in the second step a sparse quadratic discriminant
analysis (SQDA) is proposed for further selecting important interactions and
main effects and simultaneously conducting classification. Our IIS approach
screens important interactions by examining only $p$ features instead of all
two-way interactions of order $O(p^2)$. Our theory shows that the proposed
method enjoys sure screening property in interaction selection in the
high-dimensional setting of $p$ growing exponentially with the sample size. In
the selection and classification step, we establish a sparse inequality on the
estimated coefficient vector for QDA and prove that the classification error of
our procedure can be upper-bounded by the oracle classification error plus some
smaller order term. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis show
that our proposal compares favorably with existing methods in interaction
selection and high-dimensional classification.
