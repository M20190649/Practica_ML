Unsupervised deconvolution of dynamic imaging reveals intratumor
  vascular heterogeneity
Intratumor heterogeneity is often manifested by vascular compartments with
distinct pharmacokinetics that cannot be resolved directly by in vivo dynamic
imaging. We developed tissue-specific compartment modeling (TSCM), an
unsupervised computational method of deconvolving dynamic imaging series from
heterogeneous tumors that can improve vascular phenotyping in many biological
contexts. Applying TSCM to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of breast cancers
revealed characteristic intratumor vascular heterogeneity and therapeutic
responses that were otherwise undetectable.
