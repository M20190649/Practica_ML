Multiscale Shrinkage and LÃ©vy Processes
A new shrinkage-based construction is developed for a compressible vector
$\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$, for cases in which the components of $\xv$ are
naturally associated with a tree structure. Important examples are when $\xv$
corresponds to the coefficients of a wavelet or block-DCT representation of
data. The method we consider in detail, and for which numerical results are
presented, is based on increments of a gamma process. However, we demonstrate
that the general framework is appropriate for many other types of shrinkage
priors, all within the L\'{e}vy process family, with the gamma process a
special case. Bayesian inference is carried out by approximating the posterior
with samples from an MCMC algorithm, as well as by constructing a heuristic
variational approximation to the posterior. We also consider
expectation-maximization (EM) for a MAP (point) solution. State-of-the-art
results are manifested for compressive sensing and denoising applications, the
latter with spiky (non-Gaussian) noise.
