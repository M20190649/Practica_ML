Boosted nonparametric hazards with time-dependent covariates
Given functional data samples from a survival process with time-dependent
covariates, we propose a functional gradient boosting procedure for estimating
its hazard function nonparametrically. The estimator is consistent if the model
is correctly specified; alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated
for tree-based models. To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several
regularization devices. One of them is step-size restriction, but the rationale
for this is somewhat mysterious from the viewpoint of consistency. Our
convergence bounds bring some clarity to this issue by revealing that step-size
restriction is a mechanism for preventing the curvature of the risk from
derailing convergence.
