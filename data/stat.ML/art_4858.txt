Covariate Regularized Community Detection in Sparse Graphs
In this paper, we investigate community detection in networks in the presence
of node covariates. In many instances, covariates and networks individually
only give a partial view of the cluster structure. One needs to jointly infer
the full cluster structure by considering both. In statistics, an emerging body
of work has been focused on combining information from both the edges in the
network and the node covariates to infer community memberships. However, so far
the theoretical guarantees have been established in the dense regime, where the
network can lead to perfect clustering under a broad parameter regime, and
hence the role of covariates is often not clear. In this paper, we examine
sparse networks in conjunction with finite dimensional sub-gaussian mixtures as
covariates under moderate separation conditions. In this setting each
individual source can only cluster a non-vanishing fraction of nodes correctly.
We propose a simple optimization framework which provably improves clustering
accuracy when the two sources carry partial information about the cluster
memberships, and hence perform poorly on their own. Our optimization problem
can be solved using scalable convex optimization algorithms. Using a variety of
simulated and real data examples, we show that the proposed method outperforms
other existing methodology.
