Dimension reduction for model-based clustering
We introduce a dimension reduction method for visualizing the clustering
structure obtained from a finite mixture of Gaussian densities. Information on
the dimension reduction subspace is obtained from the variation on group means
and, depending on the estimated mixture model, on the variation on group
covariances. The proposed method aims at reducing the dimensionality by
identifying a set of linear combinations, ordered by importance as quantified
by the associated eigenvalues, of the original features which capture most of
the cluster structure contained in the data. Observations may then be projected
onto such a reduced subspace, thus providing summary plots which help to
visualize the clustering structure. These plots can be particularly appealing
in the case of high-dimensional data and noisy structure. The new constructed
variables capture most of the clustering information available in the data, and
they can be further reduced to improve clustering performance. We illustrate
the approach on both simulated and real data sets.
