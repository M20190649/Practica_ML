Honey Bee Dance Modeling in Real-time using Machine Learning
The waggle dance that honeybees perform is an astonishing way of
communicating the location of food source. After over 60 years of its
discovery, researchers still use manual labeling by watching hours of dance
videos to detect different transitions between dance components thus extracting
information regarding the distance and direction to the food source. We propose
an automated process to monitor and segment different components of honeybee
waggle dance. The process is highly accurate, runs in real-time, and can use
shared information between multiple dances.
