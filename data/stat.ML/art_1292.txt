Experimental Design for Non-Parametric Correction of Misspecified
  Dynamical Models
We consider a class of misspecified dynamical models where the governing term
is only approximately known. Under the assumption that observations of the
system's evolution are accessible for various initial conditions, our goal is
to infer a non-parametric correction to the misspecified driving term such as
to faithfully represent the system dynamics and devise system evolution
predictions for unobserved initial conditions.
  We model the unknown correction term as a Gaussian Process and analyze the
problem of efficient experimental design to find an optimal correction term
under constraints such as a limited experimental budget. We suggest a novel
formulation for experimental design for this Gaussian Process and show that
approximately optimal (up to a constant factor) designs may be efficiently
derived by utilizing results from the literature on submodular optimization.
Our numerical experiments exemplify the effectiveness of these techniques.
