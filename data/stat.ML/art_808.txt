Assisted Dictionary Learning for fMRI Data Analysis
Extracting information from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) images has
been a major area of research for more than two decades. The goal of this work
is to present a new method for the analysis of fMRI data sets, that is capable
to incorporate a priori available information, via an efficient optimization
framework. Tests on synthetic data sets demonstrate significant performance
gains over existing methods of this kind.
