Constructing Dynamic Treatment Regimes in Infinite-Horizon Settings
The application of existing methods for constructing optimal dynamic
treatment regimes is limited to cases where investigators are interested in
optimizing a utility function over a fixed period of time (finite horizon). In
this manuscript, we develop an inferential procedure based on temporal
difference residuals for optimal dynamic treatment regimes in infinite-horizon
settings, where there is no a priori fixed end of follow-up point. The proposed
method can be used to determine the optimal regime in chronic diseases where
patients are monitored and treated throughout their life. We derive large
sample results necessary for conducting inference. We also simulate a cohort of
patients with diabetes to mimic the third wave of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, and we examine the performance of the proposed
method in controlling the level of hemoglobin A1c. Supplementary materials for
this article are available online.
