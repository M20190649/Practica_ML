Semi-supervised Learning based on Distributionally Robust Optimization
We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on
data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) using optimal transport
metrics. Our proposed method enhances generalization error by using the
unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst case distribution in our
DRO formulation. We enable the implementation of our DRO formulation by
proposing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm which allows to easily
implement the training procedure. We demonstrate that our Semi-supervised DRO
method is able to improve the generalization error over natural supervised
procedures and state-of-the-art SSL estimators. Finally, we include a
discussion on the large sample behavior of the optimal uncertainty region in
the DRO formulation. Our discussion exposes important aspects such as the role
of dimension reduction in SSL.
