A Greedy Homotopy Method for Regression with Nonconvex Constraints
Constrained least squares regression is an essential tool for
high-dimensional data analysis. Given a partition $\mathcal{G}$ of input
variables, this paper considers a particular class of nonconvex constraint
functions that encourage the linear model to select a small number of variables
from a small number of groups in $\mathcal{G}$. Such constraints are relevant
in many practical applications, such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
Motivated by the efficiency of the Lasso homotopy method, we present RepLasso,
a greedy homotopy algorithm that tries to solve the induced sequence of
nonconvex problems by solving a sequence of suitably adapted convex surrogate
problems. We prove that in some situations RepLasso recovers the global minima
of the nonconvex problem. Moreover, even if it does not recover global minima,
we prove that in relevant cases it will still do no worse than the Lasso in
terms of support and signed support recovery, while in practice outperforming
it. We show empirically that the strategy can also be used to improve over
other Lasso-style algorithms. Finally, a GWAS of ankylosing spondylitis
highlights our method's practical utility.
