Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Binary Clustering
Quantum computing for machine learning attracts increasing attention and
recent technological developments suggest that especially adiabatic quantum
computing may soon be of practical interest. In this paper, we therefore
consider this paradigm and discuss how to adopt it to the problem of binary
clustering. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
and illustrate how systems of qubits adiabatically evolve towards a solution.
