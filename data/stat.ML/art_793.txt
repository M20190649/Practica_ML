Evaluating the Performance of Offensive Linemen in the NFL
How does one objectively measure the performance of an individual offensive
lineman in the NFL? The existing literature proposes various measures that rely
on subjective assessments of game film, but has yet to develop an objective
methodology to evaluate performance. Using a variety of statistics related to
an offensive lineman's performance, we develop a framework to objectively
analyze the overall performance of an individual offensive lineman and
determine specific linemen who are overvalued or undervalued relative to their
salary. We identify eight players across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NFL
seasons that are considered to be overvalued or undervalued and corroborate the
results with existing metrics that are based on subjective evaluation. To the
best of our knowledge, the techniques set forth in this work have not been
utilized in previous works to evaluate the performance of NFL players at any
position, including offensive linemen.
