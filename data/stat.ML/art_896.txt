Dr.VAE: Drug Response Variational Autoencoder
We present two deep generative models based on Variational Autoencoders to
improve the accuracy of drug response prediction. Our models, Perturbation
Variational Autoencoder and its semi-supervised extension, Drug Response
Variational Autoencoder (Dr.VAE), learn latent representation of the underlying
gene states before and after drug application that depend on: (i) drug-induced
biological change of each gene and (ii) overall treatment response outcome. Our
VAE-based models outperform the current published benchmarks in the field by
anywhere from 3 to 11% AUROC and 2 to 30% AUPR. In addition, we found that
better reconstruction accuracy does not necessarily lead to improvement in
classification accuracy and that jointly trained models perform better than
models that minimize reconstruction error independently.
