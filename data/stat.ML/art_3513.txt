An On-line Variational Bayesian Model for Multi-Person Tracking from
  Cluttered Scenes
Object tracking is an ubiquitous problem that appears in many applications
such as remote sensing, audio processing, computer vision, human-machine
interfaces, human-robot interaction, etc. Although thoroughly investigated in
computer vision, tracking a time-varying number of persons remains a
challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose an on-line variational
Bayesian model for multi-person tracking from cluttered visual observations
provided by person detectors. The contributions of this paper are the
followings. First, we propose a variational Bayesian framework for tracking an
unknown and varying number of persons. Second, our model results in a
variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm with closed-form
expressions for the posterior distributions of the latent variables and for the
estimation of the model parameters. Third, the proposed model exploits
observations from multiple detectors, and it is therefore multimodal by nature.
Finally, we propose to embed both object-birth and object-visibility processes
in an effort to robustly handle person appearances and disappearances over
time. Evaluated on classical multiple person tracking datasets, our method
shows competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art multiple-object
tracking models, such as the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter among
others.
