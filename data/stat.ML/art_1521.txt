Gaussian Process Classification with Privileged Information by
  Soft-to-Hard Labeling Transfer
Learning using privileged information is an attractive problem setting that
helps many learning scenarios in the real world. A state-of-the-art method of
Gaussian process classification (GPC) with privileged information is GPC+,
which incorporates privileged information into a noise term of the likelihood.
A drawback of GPC+ is that it requires numerical quadrature to calculate the
posterior distribution of the latent function, which is extremely
time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel classification
method with privileged information based on Gaussian processes, called
"soft-label-transferred Gaussian process (SLT-GP)." Our basic idea is that we
construct another learning task of predicting soft labels (continuous values)
obtained from privileged information and we perform transfer learning from this
task to the target task of predicting hard labels. We derive a PAC-Bayesian
bound of our proposed method, which justifies optimizing hyperparameters by the
empirical Bayes method. We also experimentally show the usefulness of our
proposed method compared with GPC and GPC+.
