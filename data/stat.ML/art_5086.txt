Nonparametric Bayesian label prediction on a graph
An implementation of a nonparametric Bayesian approach to solving binary
classification problems on graphs is described. A hierarchical Bayesian
approach with a randomly scaled Gaussian prior is considered. The prior uses
the graph Laplacian to take into account the underlying geometry of the graph.
A method based on a theoretically optimal prior and a more flexible variant
using partial conjugacy are proposed. Two simulated data examples and two
examples using real data are used in order to illustrate the proposed methods.
