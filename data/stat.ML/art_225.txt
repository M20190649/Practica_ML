Recovering Block-structured Activations Using Compressive Measurements
We consider the problems of detection and localization of a contiguous block
of weak activation in a large matrix, from a small number of noisy, possibly
adaptive, compressive (linear) measurements. This is closely related to the
problem of compressed sensing, where the task is to estimate a sparse vector
using a small number of linear measurements. Contrary to results in compressed
sensing, where it has been shown that neither adaptivity nor contiguous
structure help much, we show that for reliable localization the magnitude of
the weakest signals is strongly influenced by both structure and the ability to
choose measurements adaptively while for detection neither adaptivity nor
structure reduce the requirement on the magnitude of the signal. We
characterize the precise tradeoffs between the various problem parameters, the
signal strength and the number of measurements required to reliably detect and
localize the block of activation. The sufficient conditions are complemented
with information theoretic lower bounds.
