Binary classification of multi-channel EEG records based on the
  $Îµ$-complexity of continuous vector functions
A methodology for binary classification of EEG records which correspond to
different mental states is proposed. This model-free methodology is based on
our theory of the $\epsilon$-complexity of continuous functions which is
extended here (see Appendix) to the case of vector functions. This extension
permits us to handle multichannel EEG recordings. The essence of the
methodology is to use the $\epsilon$-complexity coefficients as features to
classify (using well known classifiers) different types of vector functions
representing EEG-records corresponding to different types of mental states. We
apply our methodology to the problem of classification of multichannel
EEG-records related to a group of healthy adolescents and a group of
adolescents with schizophrenia. We found that our methodology permits accurate
classification of the data in the four-dimensional feather space of the
$\epsilon$-complexity coefficients.
