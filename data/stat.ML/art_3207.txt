Marginalizing Gaussian Process Hyperparameters using Sequential Monte
  Carlo
Gaussian process regression is a popular method for non-parametric
probabilistic modeling of functions. The Gaussian process prior is
characterized by so-called hyperparameters, which often have a large influence
on the posterior model and can be difficult to tune. This work provides a
method for numerical marginalization of the hyperparameters, relying on the
rigorous framework of sequential Monte Carlo. Our method is well suited for
online problems, and we demonstrate its ability to handle real-world problems
with several dimensions and compare it to other marginalization methods. We
also conclude that our proposed method is a competitive alternative to the
commonly used point estimates maximizing the likelihood, both in terms of
computational load and its ability to handle multimodal posteriors.
