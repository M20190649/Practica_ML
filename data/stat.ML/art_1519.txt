Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis simply explained
There are a multitude of methods to perform multi-set correlated component
analysis (MCCA), including some that require iterative solutions. The methods
differ on the criterion they optimize and the constraints placed on the
solutions. This note focuses perhaps on the simplest version, which can be
solved in a single step as the eigenvectors of matrix ${\bf D}^{-1} {\bf R}$.
Here ${\bf R}$ is the covariance matrix of the concatenated data, and ${\bf D}$
is its block-diagonal. This note shows that this solution maximizes inter-set
correlation (ISC) without further constraints. It also relates the solution to
a two step procedure, which first whitens each dataset using PCA, and then
performs an additional PCA on the concatenated and whitened data. Both these
solutions are known, although a clear derivation and simple implementation are
hard to find. This short note aims to remedy this.
