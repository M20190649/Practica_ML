Data-Efficient Exploration, Optimization, and Modeling of Diverse
  Designs through Surrogate-Assisted Illumination
The MAP-Elites algorithm produces a set of high-performing solutions that
vary according to features defined by the user. This technique has the
potential to be a powerful tool for design space exploration, but is limited by
the need for numerous evaluations. The Surrogate-Assisted Illumination
algorithm (SAIL), introduced here, integrates approximative models and
intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of
evaluations required by MAP-Elites.
  The ability of SAIL to efficiently produce both accurate models and diverse
high performing solutions is illustrated on a 2D airfoil design problem. The
search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a different
combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution
than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations.
The CMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with
the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal
solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin.
