Feature Elimination in Kernel Machines in moderately high dimensions
We develop an approach for feature elimination in statistical learning with
kernel machines, based on recursive elimination of features.We present
theoretical properties of this method and show that it is uniformly consistent
in finding the correct feature space under certain generalized assumptions.We
present four case studies to show that the assumptions are met in most
practical situations and present simulation results to demonstrate performance
of the proposed approach.
