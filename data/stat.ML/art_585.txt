Consistency of Spectral Hypergraph Partitioning under Planted Partition
  Model
Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of a number of problems in machine
learning and network sciences. Many algorithms for hypergraph partitioning have
been proposed that extend standard approaches for graph partitioning to the
case of hypergraphs. However, theoretical aspects of such methods have seldom
received attention in the literature as compared to the extensive studies on
the guarantees of graph partitioning. For instance, consistency results of
spectral graph partitioning under the stochastic block model are well known. In
this paper, we present a planted partition model for sparse random non-uniform
hypergraphs that generalizes the stochastic block model. We derive an error
bound for a spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under this model using
matrix concentration inequalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first consistency result related to partitioning non-uniform hypergraphs.
