Efficient Algorithm for Extremely Large Multi-task Regression with
  Massive Structured Sparsity
We develop a highly scalable optimization method called "hierarchical
group-thresholding" for solving a multi-task regression model with complex
structured sparsity constraints on both input and output spaces. Despite the
recent emergence of several efficient optimization algorithms for tackling
complex sparsity-inducing regularizers, true scalability in practical
high-dimensional problems where a huge amount (e.g., millions) of sparsity
patterns need to be enforced remains an open challenge, because all existing
algorithms must deal with ALL such patterns exhaustively in every iteration,
which is computationally prohibitive. Our proposed algorithm addresses the
scalability problem by screening out multiple groups of coefficients
simultaneously and systematically. We employ a hierarchical tree representation
of group constraints to accelerate the process of removing irrelevant
constraints by taking advantage of the inclusion relationships between group
sparsities, thereby avoiding dealing with all constraints in every optimization
step, and necessitating optimization operation only on a small number of
outstanding coefficients. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of
our method on simulation datasets, and in an application of detecting genetic
variants associated with gene expression traits.
