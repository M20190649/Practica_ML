Learning a Hybrid Architecture for Sequence Regression and Annotation
When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations can
often be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated from
the path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ-
ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation.
In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling both
latent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summary
response variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patible
with a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability of
additional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve the
annotation of the se- quential observations and yield good prediction
performance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets.
