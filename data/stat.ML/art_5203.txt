On the Sample Complexity of Graphical Model Selection for Non-Stationary
  Processes
We characterize the sample size required for accurate graphical model
selection from non-stationary samples. The observed data is modeled as a
vector-valued zero-mean Gaussian random process whose samples are uncorrelated
but have different covariance matrices. This model contains as special cases
the standard setting of i.i.d. samples as well as the case of samples forming a
stationary or underspread (non-stationary) processes. More generally, our model
applies to any process model for which an efficient decorrelation can be
obtained. By analyzing a particular model selection method, we derive a
sufficient condition on the required sample size for accurate graphical model
selection based on non-stationary data.
