Penalized estimation in large-scale generalized linear array models
Large-scale generalized linear array models (GLAMs) can be challenging to
fit. Computation and storage of its tensor product design matrix can be
impossible due to time and memory constraints, and previously considered design
matrix free algorithms do not scale well with the dimension of the parameter
vector. A new design matrix free algorithm is proposed for computing the
penalized maximum likelihood estimate for GLAMs, which, in particular, handles
nondifferentiable penalty functions. The proposed algorithm is implemented and
available via the R package \verb+glamlasso+. It combines several ideas --
previously considered separately -- to obtain sparse estimates while at the
same time efficiently exploiting the GLAM structure. In this paper the
convergence of the algorithm is treated and the performance of its
implementation is investigated and compared to that of \verb+glmnet+ on
simulated as well as real data. It is shown that the computation time for
