RKL: a general, invariant Bayes solution for Neyman-Scott
Neyman-Scott is a classic example of an estimation problem with a
partially-consistent posterior, for which standard estimation methods tend to
produce inconsistent results. Past attempts to create consistent estimators for
Neyman-Scott have led to ad-hoc solutions, to estimators that do not satisfy
representation invariance, to restrictions over the choice of prior and more.
We present a simple construction for a general-purpose Bayes estimator,
invariant to representation, which satisfies consistency on Neyman-Scott over
any non-degenerate prior. We argue that the good attributes of the estimator
are due to its intrinsic properties, and generalise beyond Neyman-Scott as
well.
