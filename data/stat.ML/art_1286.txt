Structured Sparse Modelling with Hierarchical GP
In this paper a new Bayesian model for sparse linear regression with a
spatio-temporal structure is proposed. It incorporates the structural
assumptions based on a hierarchical Gaussian process prior for spike and slab
coefficients. We design an inference algorithm based on Expectation Propagation
and evaluate the model over the real data.
