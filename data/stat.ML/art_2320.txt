Clustering of functional boxplots for multiple streaming time series
In this paper we introduce a micro-clustering strategy for Functional
Boxplots. The aim is to summarize a set of streaming time series splitted in
non overlapping windows. It is a two step strategy which performs at first, an
on-line summarization by means of functional data structures, named Functional
Boxplot micro-clusters; then it reveals the final summarization by processing,
off-line, the functional data structures. Our main contribute consists in
providing a new definition of micro-cluster based on Functional Boxplots and,
in defining a proximity measure which allows to compare and update them. This
allows to get a finer graphical summarization of the streaming time series by
five functional basic statistics of data. The obtained synthesis will be able
to keep track of the dynamic evolution of the multiple streams.
