Kernel-Based Methods for Non-Linear Reduced Modeling
An interesting application of kernel-based dynamic mode decomposition is
data-driven reduced modeling of dynamical systems. Such reduced models rely on
the solution of low-rank constrained optimization problems defined in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We propose tractable implementations of
these reduced models, even though they rely on the optimal solution of
infinite-dimensional problems. Particularizing to common kernels, we design
low-complexity algorithms going beyond state of the art of non-linear reduced
modeling.
