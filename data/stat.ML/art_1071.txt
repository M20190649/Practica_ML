Modeling Group Dynamics Using Probabilistic Tensor Decompositions
We propose a probabilistic modeling framework for learning the dynamic
patterns in the collective behaviors of social agents and developing profiles
for different behavioral groups, using data collected from multiple information
sources. The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in
which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the
mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group
is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover,
as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the
change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed
transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on
tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for
parameter estimation.
