Testing for Causality in Continuous Time Bayesian Network Models of
  High-Frequency Data
Continuous time Bayesian networks are investigated with a special focus on
their ability to express causality. A framework is presented for doing
inference in these networks. The central contributions are a representation of
the intensity matrices for the networks and the introduction of a causality
measure. A new model for high-frequency financial data is presented. It is
calibrated to market data and by the new causality measure it performs better
than older models.
