3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain Tumor Segmentation: A
  Comparison of Multi-resolution Architectures
This paper analyzes the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for brain
tumor segmentation in MR images. We address the problem using three different
architectures that combine fine and coarse features to obtain the final
segmentation. We compare three different networks that use multi-resolution
features in terms of both design and performance and we show that they improve
their single-resolution counterparts.
