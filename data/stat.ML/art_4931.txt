Sequence Graph Transform (SGT): A Feature Extraction Function for
  Sequence Data Mining (Extended Version)
The ubiquitous presence of sequence data across fields such as the web,
healthcare, bioinformatics, and text mining has made sequence mining a vital
research area. However, sequence mining is particularly challenging because of
difficulty in finding (dis)similarity/distance between sequences. This is
because a distance measure between sequences is not obvious due to their
unstructuredness---arbitrary strings of arbitrary length. Feature
representations, such as n-grams, are often used but they either compromise on
extracting both short- and long-term sequence patterns or have a high
computation. We propose a new function, Sequence Graph Transform (SGT), that
extracts the short- and long-term sequence features and embeds them in a
finite-dimensional feature space. Importantly, SGT has low computation and can
extract any amount of short- to long-term patterns without any increase in the
computation, also proved theoretically in this paper. Due to this, SGT yields
superior result with significantly higher accuracy and lower computation
compared to the existing methods. We show it via several experimentation and
SGT's real world application for clustering, classification, search and
visualization as examples.
