Distributionally Ambiguous Optimization Techniques for Batch Bayesian
  Optimization
We propose a novel, theoretically-grounded, acquisition function for Batch
Bayesian optimization informed by insights from distributionally ambiguous
optimization. Our acquisition function is a lower bound on the well-known
Expected Improvement function, which requires evaluation of a Gaussian
Expectation over a multivariate piecewise affine function. Our bound is
computed instead by evaluating the best-case expectation over all probability
distributions consistent with the same mean and variance as the original
Gaussian distribution. Unlike alternative approaches, including Expected
Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional
integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly - even on large batch sizes
- as the solution of a tractable convex optimization problem. Our suggested
acquisition function can also be optimized efficiently, since first and second
derivative information can be calculated inexpensively as by-products of the
acquisition function calculation itself. We derive various novel theorems that
ground our work theoretically and we demonstrate superior performance via
simple motivating examples, benchmark functions and real-world problems.
