A probabilistic network for the diagnosis of acute cardiopulmonary
  diseases
In this paper, the development of a probabilistic network for the diagnosis
of acute cardiopulmonary diseases is presented. This paper is a draft version
of the article published after peer review in 2018
(https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.201600206). A panel of expert physicians
collaborated to specify the qualitative part, that is a directed acyclic graph
defining a factorization of the joint probability distribution of domain
variables. The quantitative part, that is the set of all conditional
probability distributions defined by each factor, was estimated in the Bayesian
paradigm: we applied a special formal representation, characterized by a low
number of parameters and a parameterization intelligible for physicians,
elicited the joint prior distribution of parameters from medical experts, and
updated it by conditioning on a dataset of hospital patient records using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Refinement was cyclically performed until
the probabilistic network provided satisfactory Concordance Index values for a
selection of acute diseases and reasonable inference on six fictitious patient
cases. The probabilistic network can be employed to perform medical diagnosis
on a total of 63 diseases (38 acute and 25 chronic) on the basis of up to 167
patient findings.
