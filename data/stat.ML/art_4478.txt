Mixed LICORS: A Nonparametric Algorithm for Predictive State
  Reconstruction
We introduce 'mixed LICORS', an algorithm for learning nonlinear,
high-dimensional dynamics from spatio-temporal data, suitable for both
prediction and simulation. Mixed LICORS extends the recent LICORS algorithm
(Goerg and Shalizi, 2012) from hard clustering of predictive distributions to a
non-parametric, EM-like soft clustering. This retains the asymptotic predictive
optimality of LICORS, but, as we show in simulations, greatly improves
out-of-sample forecasts with limited data. The new method is implemented in the
publicly-available R package "LICORS"
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LICORS/).
