Numerical Coding of Nominal Data
In this paper, a novel approach for coding nominal data is proposed. For the
given nominal data, a rank in a form of complex number is assigned. The
proposed method does not lose any information about the attribute and brings
other properties previously unknown. The approach based on these knew
properties can been used for classification. The analyzed example shows that
classification with the use of coded nominal data or both numerical as well as
coded nominal data is more effective than the classification, which uses only
numerical data.
