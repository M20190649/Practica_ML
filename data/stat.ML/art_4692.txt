Accelerated Randomized Mirror Descent Algorithms For Composite
  Non-strongly Convex Optimization
We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of an average function of a
large number of smooth convex components and a general, possibly
non-differentiable, convex function. Although many methods have been proposed
to solve this problem with the assumption that the sum is strongly convex, few
methods support the non-strongly convex case. Adding a small quadratic
regularization is a common devise used to tackle non-strongly convex problems;
however, it may cause loss of sparsity of solutions or weaken the performance
of the algorithms. Avoiding this devise, we propose an accelerated randomized
mirror descent method for solving this problem without the strongly convex
assumption. Our method extends the deterministic accelerated proximal gradient
methods of Paul Tseng and can be applied even when proximal points are computed
inexactly. We also propose a scheme for solving the problem when the component
functions are non-smooth.
