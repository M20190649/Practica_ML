Relations Between Adjacency and Modularity Graph Partitioning
In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvector of
the unnormalized modularity matrix and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix
is developed. Based on this analysis a method to approximate the leading
eigenvector of the modularity matrix is given, and the relative error of the
approximation is derived. A complete proof of the equivalence between
normalized modularity clustering and normalized adjacency clustering is also
given. Some applications and experiments are given to illustrate and
corroborate the points that are made in the theoretical development.
