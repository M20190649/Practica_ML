Ensembling classification models based on phalanxes of variables with
  applications in drug discovery
Statistical detection of a rare class of objects in a two-class
classification problem can pose several challenges. Because the class of
interest is rare in the training data, there is relatively little information
in the known class response labels for model building. At the same time the
available explanatory variables are often moderately high dimensional. In the
four assays of our drug-discovery application, compounds are active or not
against a specific biological target, such as lung cancer tumor cells, and
active compounds are rare. Several sets of chemical descriptor variables from
computational chemistry are available to classify the active versus inactive
class; each can have up to thousands of variables characterizing molecular
structure of the compounds. The statistical challenge is to make use of the
richness of the explanatory variables in the presence of scant response
information. Our algorithm divides the explanatory variables into subsets
adaptively and passes each subset to a base classifier. The various base
classifiers are then ensembled to produce one model to rank new objects by
their estimated probabilities of belonging to the rare class of interest. The
essence of the algorithm is to choose the subsets such that variables in the
same group work well together; we call such groups phalanxes.
