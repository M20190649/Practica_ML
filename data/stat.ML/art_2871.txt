A Comprehensive Approach to Mode Clustering
Mode clustering is a nonparametric method for clustering that defines
clusters using the basins of attraction of a density estimator's modes. We
provide several enhancements to mode clustering: (i) a soft variant of cluster
assignment, (ii) a measure of connectivity between clusters, (iii) a technique
for choosing the bandwidth, (iv) a method for denoising small clusters, and (v)
an approach to visualizing the clusters. Combining all these enhancements gives
us a complete procedure for clustering in multivariate problems. We also
compare mode clustering to other clustering methods in several examples
