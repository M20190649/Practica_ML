Shift Aggregate Extract Networks
We introduce an architecture based on deep hierarchical decompositions to
learn effective representations of large graphs. Our framework extends classic
R-decompositions used in kernel methods, enabling nested "part-of-part"
relations. Unlike recursive neural networks, which unroll a template on input
graphs directly, we unroll a neural network template over the decomposition
hierarchy, allowing us to deal with the high degree variability that typically
characterize social network graphs. Deep hierarchical decompositions are also
amenable to domain compression, a technique that reduces both space and time
complexity by exploiting symmetries. We show empirically that our approach is
competitive with current state-of-the-art graph classification methods,
particularly when dealing with social network datasets.
