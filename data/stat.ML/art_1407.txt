Weighted Orthogonal Components Regression Analysis
In the multiple linear regression setting, we propose a general framework,
termed weighted orthogonal components regression (WOCR), which encompasses many
known methods as special cases, including ridge regression and principal
components regression. WOCR makes use of the monotonicity inherent in
orthogonal components to parameterize the weight function. The formulation
allows for efficient determination of tuning parameters and hence is
computationally advantageous. Moreover, WOCR offers insights for deriving new
better variants. Specifically, we advocate weighting components based on their
correlations with the response, which leads to enhanced predictive performance.
Both simulated studies and real data examples are provided to assess and
illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods.
