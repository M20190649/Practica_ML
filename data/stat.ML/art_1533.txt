History PCA: A New Algorithm for Streaming PCA
In this paper we propose a new algorithm for streaming principal component
analysis. With limited memory, small devices cannot store all the samples in
the high-dimensional regime. Streaming principal component analysis aims to
find the $k$-dimensional subspace which can explain the most variation of the
$d$-dimensional data points that come into memory sequentially. In order to
deal with large $d$ and large $N$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA
algorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then
dump the information right away to save memory. However the information
contained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea,
we develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this
goal. By using $O(Bd)$ memory with $B\approx 10$ being the block size, our
algorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By
changing the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further
reduced to $O(d)$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate
of convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that
our algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA
methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.
