Robust and Parallel Bayesian Model Selection
Effective and accurate model selection is an important problem in modern data
analysis. One of the major challenges is the computational burden required to
handle large data sets that cannot be stored or processed on one machine.
Another challenge one may encounter is the presence of outliers and
contaminations that damage the inference quality. The parallel "divide and
conquer" model selection strategy divides the observations of the full data set
into roughly equal subsets and perform inference and model selection
independently on each subset. After local subset inference, this method
aggregates the posterior model probabilities or other model/variable selection
criteria to obtain a final model by using the notion of geometric median. This
approach leads to improved concentration in finding the "correct" model and
model parameters and also is provably robust to outliers and data
contamination.
