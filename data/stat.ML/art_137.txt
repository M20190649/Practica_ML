Auto-associative models, nonlinear Principal component analysis,
  manifolds and projection pursuit
In this paper, auto-associative models are proposed as candidates to the
generalization of Principal Component Analysis. We show that these models are
dedicated to the approximation of the dataset by a manifold. Here, the word
"manifold" refers to the topology properties of the structure. The
approximating manifold is built by a projection pursuit algorithm. At each step
of the algorithm, the dimension of the manifold is incremented. Some
theoretical properties are provided. In particular, we can show that, at each
step of the algorithm, the mean residuals norm is not increased. Moreover, it
is also established that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps.
Some particular auto-associative models are exhibited and compared to the
classical PCA and some neural networks models. Implementation aspects are
discussed. We show that, in numerous cases, no optimization procedure is
required. Some illustrations on simulated and real data are presented.
