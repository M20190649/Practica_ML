Truncated Variational Sampling for "Black Box" Optimization of
  Generative Models
We investigate the optimization of two probabilistic generative models with
binary latent variables using a novel variational EM approach. The approach
distinguishes itself from previous variational approaches by using latent
states as variational parameters. Here we use efficient and general purpose
sampling procedures to vary the latent states, and investigate the "black box"
applicability of the resulting optimization procedure. For general purpose
applicability, samples are drawn from approximate marginal distributions of the
considered generative model as well as from the model's prior distribution. As
such, variational sampling is defined in a generic form, and is directly
executable for a given model. As a proof of concept, we then apply the novel
procedure (A) to Binary Sparse Coding (a model with continuous observables),
and (B) to basic Sigmoid Belief Networks (which are models with binary
observables). Numerical experiments verify that the investigated approach
efficiently as well as effectively increases a variational free energy
objective without requiring any additional analytical steps.
