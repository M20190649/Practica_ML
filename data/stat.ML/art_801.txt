Model Selection for Gaussian Process Regression by Approximation Set
  Coding
Gaussian processes are powerful, yet analytically tractable models for
supervised learning. A Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and
a covariance function (kernel), which are determined by a model selection
criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in their
parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which
function structure to choose, for instance to decide between a squared
exponential and a rational quadratic kernel. Based on the principle of
approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to rank
kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set
coding shows promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with
maximum evidence (also called marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out
cross-validation.
