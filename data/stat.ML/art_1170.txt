Iterative Thresholding for Demixing Structured Superpositions in High
  Dimensions
We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) high-dimensional vectors
from nonlinear observations when the number of such observations is far less
than the ambient dimension of the underlying vectors. Specifically, we
demonstrate an algorithm that stably estimate the underlying components under
general \emph{structured sparsity} assumptions on these components.
Specifically, we show that for certain types of structured superposition
models, our method provably recovers the components given merely $n =
\mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the number of nonzero entries in the
underlying components. Moreover, our method achieves a fast (linear)
convergence rate, and also exhibits fast (near-linear) per-iteration complexity
for certain types of structured models. We also provide a range of simulations
to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
