A general multiblock method for structured variable selection
Regularised canonical correlation analysis was recently extended to more than
two sets of variables by the multiblock method Regularised generalised
canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA). Further, Sparse GCCA (SGCCA) was
proposed to address the issue of variable selection. However, for technical
reasons, the variable selection offered by SGCCA was restricted to a covariance
link between the blocks (i.e., with $\tau=1$). One of the main contributions of
this paper is to go beyond the covariance link and to propose an extension of
SGCCA for the full RGCCA model (i.e., with $\tau\in[0, 1]$). In addition, we
propose an extension of SGCCA that exploits structural relationships between
variables within blocks. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that allows
structured and sparsity-inducing penalties to be included in the RGCCA
optimisation problem. The proposed multiblock method is illustrated on a real
three-block high-grade glioma data set, where the aim is to predict the
location of the brain tumours, and on a simulated data set, where the aim is to
illustrate the method's ability to reconstruct the true underlying weight
vectors.
