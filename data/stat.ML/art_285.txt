Structural Intervention Distance (SID) for Evaluating Causal Graphs
Causal inference relies on the structure of a graph, often a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). Different graphs may result in different causal inference
statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such
differences, we propose a (pre-) distance between DAGs, the structural
intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and
quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding
causal inference statements. It is therefore well-suited for evaluating graphs
that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs it is also possible
to compare CPDAGs, completed partially directed acyclic graphs that represent
Markov equivalence classes. Since it differs significantly from the popular
Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), the SID constitutes a valuable additional
measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide an efficient
implementation with software code available on the first author's homepage (an
R package is under construction).
