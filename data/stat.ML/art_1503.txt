Gradient descent revisited via an adaptive online learning rate
Any gradient descent optimization requires to choose a learning rate. With
deeper and deeper models, tuning that learning rate can easily become tedious
and does not necessarily lead to an ideal convergence. We propose a variation
of the gradient descent algorithm in the which the learning rate is not fixed.
Instead, we learn the learning rate itself, either by another gradient descent
(first-order method), or by Newton's method (second-order). This way, gradient
descent for any machine learning algorithm can be optimized.
