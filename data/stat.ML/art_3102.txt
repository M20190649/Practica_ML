N-sphere chord length distribution
This work studies the chord length distribution, in the case where both ends
lie on a $N$-dimensional hypersphere ($N \geq 2$). Actually, after connecting
this distribution to the recently estimated surface of a hyperspherical cap
\cite{SLi11}, closed-form expressions of both the probability density function
and the cumulative distribution function are straightforwardly extracted, which
are followed by a discussion on its basic properties, among which its
dependence from the hypersphere dimension. Additionally, the distribution of
the dot product of unitary vectors is estimated, a problem that is related to
the chord length.
