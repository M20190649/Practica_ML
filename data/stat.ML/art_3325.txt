Analysis of Nuclear Norm Regularization for Full-rank Matrix Completion
In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the nuclear-norm
regularized least squares for full-rank matrix completion. Although similar
formulations have been examined by previous studies, their results are
unsatisfactory because only additive upper bounds are provided. Under the
assumption that the top eigenspaces of the target matrix are incoherent, we
derive a relative upper bound for recovering the best low-rank approximation of
the unknown matrix. Our relative upper bound is tighter than previous additive
bounds of other methods if the mass of the target matrix is concentrated on its
top eigenspaces, and also implies perfect recovery if it is low-rank. The
analysis is built upon the optimality condition of the regularized formulation
and existing guarantees for low-rank matrix completion. To the best of our
knowledge, this is first time such a relative bound is proved for the
regularized formulation of matrix completion.
