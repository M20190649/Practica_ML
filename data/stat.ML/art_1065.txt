Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable
Tree ensembles, such as random forest and boosted trees, are renowned for
their high prediction performance, whereas their interpretability is critically
limited. In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the
model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree
ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is
interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM
algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic
experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably
as interpretable.
