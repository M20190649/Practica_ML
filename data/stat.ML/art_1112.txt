Clustering Mixed Datasets Using Homogeneity Analysis with Applications
  to Big Data
Datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes are routinely
encountered in many application domains. In this work we examine an approach to
clustering such datasets using homogeneity analysis. Homogeneity analysis
determines a euclidean representation of the data. This can be analyzed by
leveraging the large body of tools and techniques for data with a euclidean
representation. Experiments conducted as part of this study suggest that this
approach can be useful in the analysis and exploration of big datasets with a
mixture of numerical and categorical attributes.
