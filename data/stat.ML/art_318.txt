Perfect Clustering for Stochastic Blockmodel Graphs via Adjacency
  Spectral Embedding
Vertex clustering in a stochastic blockmodel graph has wide applicability and
has been the subject of extensive research. In thispaper, we provide a short
proof that the adjacency spectral embedding can be used to obtain perfect
clustering for the stochastic blockmodel and the degree-corrected stochastic
blockmodel. We also show an analogous result for the more general random dot
product graph model.
