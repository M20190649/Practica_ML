Decontamination of Mutual Contamination Models
Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination
models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different
convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions and the goal is to
infer these base distributions. This paper considers the general setting where
the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine
three popular machine learning problems that arise in this general setting:
multiclass classification with label noise, demixing of mixed membership
models, and classification with partial labels. In each case, we give
sufficient conditions for identifiability and present algorithms for the
infinite and finite sample settings, with associated performance guarantees.
