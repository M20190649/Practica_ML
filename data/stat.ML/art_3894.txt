A new kernel-based approach to system identification with quantized
  output data
In this paper we introduce a novel method for linear system identification
with quantized output data. We model the impulse response as a zero-mean
Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed
stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential
stability. This serves as a starting point to cast our system identification
problem into a Bayesian framework. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
to provide an estimate of the system. In particular, we design two methods
based on the so-called Gibbs sampler that allow also to estimate the kernel
hyperparameters by marginal likelihood maximization via the
expectation-maximization method. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme, as compared to the state-of-the-art kernel-based
methods when these are employed in system identification with quantized data.
