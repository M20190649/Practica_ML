An improved quasar detection method in EROS-2 and MACHO LMC datasets
We present a new classification method for quasar identification in the
EROS-2 and MACHO datasets based on a boosted version of Random Forest
classifier. We use a set of variability features including parameters of a
continuous auto regressive model. We prove that continuous auto regressive
parameters are very important discriminators in the classification process. We
create two training sets (one for EROS-2 and one for MACHO datasets) using
known quasars found in the LMC. Our model's accuracy in both EROS-2 and MACHO
training sets is about 90% precision and 86% recall, improving the state of the
art models accuracy in quasar detection. We apply the model on the complete,
including 28 million objects, EROS-2 and MACHO LMC datasets, finding 1160 and
2551 candidates respectively. To further validate our list of candidates, we
crossmatched our list with a previous 663 known strong candidates, getting 74%
of matches for MACHO and 40% in EROS-2. The main difference on matching level
is because EROS-2 is a slightly shallower survey which translates to
significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio lightcurves.
