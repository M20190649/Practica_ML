Multilabel Classification with R Package mlr
We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine
learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier
chains, nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be
used with any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access
to the multilabel classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All
these methods can be easily compared by different implemented multilabel
performance measures and resampling methods in the standardized mlr framework.
In a benchmark experiment with several multilabel datasets, the performance of
the different methods is evaluated.
