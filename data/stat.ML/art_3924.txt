Post Selection Inference with Kernels
We propose a novel kernel based post selection inference (PSI) algorithm,
which can not only handle non-linearity in data but also structured output such
as multi-dimensional and multi-label outputs. Specifically, we develop a PSI
algorithm for independence measures, and propose the Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion (HSIC) based PSI algorithm (hsicInf). The novelty of the
proposed algorithm is that it can handle non-linearity and/or structured data
through kernels. Namely, the proposed algorithm can be used for wider range of
applications including nonlinear multi-class classification and multi-variate
regressions, while existing PSI algorithms cannot handle them. Through
synthetic experiments, we show that the proposed approach can find a set of
statistically significant features for both regression and classification
problems. Moreover, we apply the hsicInf algorithm to a real-world data, and
show that hsicInf can successfully identify important features.
