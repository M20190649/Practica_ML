Bayesian Reconstruction of Missing Observations
We focus on an interpolation method referred to Bayesian reconstruction in
this paper. Whereas in standard interpolation methods missing data are
interpolated deterministically, in Bayesian reconstruction, missing data are
interpolated probabilistically using a Bayesian treatment. In this paper, we
address the framework of Bayesian reconstruction and its application to the
traffic data reconstruction problem in the field of traffic engineering. In the
latter part of this paper, we describe the evaluation of the statistical
performance of our Bayesian traffic reconstruction model using a statistical
mechanical approach and clarify its statistical behavior.
