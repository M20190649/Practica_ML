Sparse quadratic classification rules via linear dimension reduction
We consider the problem of high-dimensional classification between the two
groups with unequal covariance matrices. Rather than estimating the full
quadratic discriminant rule, we propose to perform simultaneous variable
selection and linear dimension reduction on original data, with the subsequent
application of quadratic discriminant analysis on the reduced space. In
contrast to quadratic discriminant analysis, the proposed framework doesn't
require estimation of precision matrices and scales linearly with the number of
measurements, making it especially attractive for the use on high-dimensional
datasets. We support the methodology with theoretical guarantees on variable
selection consistency, and empirical comparison with competing approaches. We
apply the method to gene expression data of breast cancer patients, and confirm
the crucial importance of ESR1 gene in differentiating estrogen receptor
status.
