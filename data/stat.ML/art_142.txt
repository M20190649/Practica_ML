A Risk Comparison of Ordinary Least Squares vs Ridge Regression
We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary least
squares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensional
subspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs an
ordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This note
shows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constant
factor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression.
