Parallel Chromatic MCMC with Spatial Partitioning
We introduce a novel approach for parallelizing MCMC inference in models with
spatially determined conditional independence relationships, for which existing
techniques exploiting graphical model structure are not applicable. Our
approach is motivated by a model of seismic events and signals, where events
detected in distant regions are approximately independent given those in
intermediate regions. We perform parallel inference by coloring a factor graph
defined over regions of latent space, rather than individual model variables.
Evaluating on a model of seismic event detection, we achieve significant
speedups over serial MCMC with no degradation in inference quality.
