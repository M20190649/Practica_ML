A Blockwise Descent Algorithm for Group-penalized Multiresponse and
  Multinomial Regression
In this paper we purpose a blockwise descent algorithm for group-penalized
multiresponse regression. Using a quasi-newton framework we extend this to
group-penalized multinomial regression. We give a publicly available
implementation for these in R, and compare the speed of this algorithm to a
competing algorithm --- we show that our implementation is an order of
magnitude faster than its competitor, and can solve gene-expression-sized
problems in real time.
