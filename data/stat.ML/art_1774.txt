A Variational Bayes Approach to Decoding in a Phase-Uncertain Digital
  Receiver
This paper presents a Bayesian approach to symbol and phase inference in a
phase-unsynchronized digital receiver. It primarily extends [Quinn 2011] to the
multi-symbol case, using the variational Bayes (VB) approximation to deal with
the combinatorial complexity of the phase inference in this case. The work
provides a fully Bayesian extension of the EM-based framework underlying
current turbo-synchronization methods, since it induces a von Mises prior on
the time-invariant phase parmeter. As a result, we achieve tractable iterative
algorithms with improved robustness in low SNR regimes, compared to the current
EM-based approaches. As a corollary to our analysis we also discover the
importance of prior regularization in elegantly tackling the significant
problem of phase ambiguity.
