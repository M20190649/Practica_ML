Variational Joint Filtering
State space models provide an interpretable framework for complex time series
by combining an intuitive dynamical system model with a probabilistic
observation model. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent
nonlinear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Our method utilizes the
stochastic gradient variational Bayes method to jointly optimize the parameters
of the nonlinear dynamics, observation model, and the black-box recognition
model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial
observation noise models and has potential of inferring in real-time. We test
our method on point process and Gaussian observations driven by continuous
attractor dynamics and nonstationary systems, demonstrating its ability to
recover the phase portrait, filtered trajectory, and produce long-term
predictions for online machine learning.
