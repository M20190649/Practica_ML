Sketchy Decisions: Convex Low-Rank Matrix Optimization with Optimal
  Storage
This paper concerns a fundamental class of convex matrix optimization
problems. It presents the first algorithm that uses optimal storage and
provably computes a low-rank approximation of a solution. In particular, when
all solutions have low rank, the algorithm converges to a solution. This
algorithm, SketchyCGM, modifies a standard convex optimization scheme, the
conditional gradient method, to store only a small randomized sketch of the
matrix variable. After the optimization terminates, the algorithm extracts a
low-rank approximation of the solution from the sketch. In contrast to
nonconvex heuristics, the guarantees for SketchyCGM do not rely on statistical
models for the problem data. Numerical work demonstrates the benefits of
SketchyCGM over heuristics.
