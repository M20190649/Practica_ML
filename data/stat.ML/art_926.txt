Kernel Conditional Exponential Family
A nonparametric family of conditional distributions is introduced, which
generalizes conditional exponential families using functional parameters in a
suitable RKHS. An algorithm is provided for learning the generalized natural
parameter, and consistency of the estimator is established in the well
specified case. In experiments, the new method generally outperforms a
competing approach with consistency guarantees, and is competitive with a deep
conditional density model on datasets that exhibit abrupt transitions and
heteroscedasticity.
