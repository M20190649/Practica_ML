The blessing of transitivity in sparse and stochastic networks
The interaction between transitivity and sparsity, two common features in
empirical networks, implies that there are local regions of large sparse
networks that are dense. We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has
consequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that
statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the
edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the
asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also
non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the
expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically
small. \n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small "local"
clusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation
when compared to "global" graph partitions. This paper provides the first
statistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are
also more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a "local"
clustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic
block of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only
constraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be
generated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation
for the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms.
