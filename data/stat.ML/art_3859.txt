Modeling and Estimation of Discrete-Time Reciprocal Processes via
  Probabilistic Graphical Models
Reciprocal processes are acausal generalizations of Markov processes
introduced by Bernstein in 1932. In the literature, a significant amount of
attention has been focused on developing dynamical models for reciprocal
processes. In this paper, we provide a probabilistic graphical model for
reciprocal processes. This leads to a principled solution of the smoothing
problem via message passing algorithms. For the finite state space case,
convergence analysis is revisited via the Hilbert metric.
