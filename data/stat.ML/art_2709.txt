Chebushev Greedy Algorithm in convex optimization
Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm is a generalization of the well known Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit defined in a Hilbert space to the case of Banach spaces. We
apply this algorithm for constructing sparse approximate solutions (with
respect to a given dictionary) to convex optimization problems. Rate of
convergence results in a style of the Lebesgue-type inequalities are proved.
