Optimal bandwidth estimation for a fast manifold learning algorithm to
  detect circular structure in high-dimensional data
We provide a way to infer about existence of topological circularity in
high-dimensional data sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ from its projection in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ obtained through a fast manifold learning map as a function of
the high-dimensional dataset $\mathbb{X}$ and a particular choice of a positive
real $\sigma$ known as bandwidth parameter. At the same time we also provide a
way to estimate the optimal bandwidth for fast manifold learning in this
setting through minimization of these functions of bandwidth. We also provide
limit theorems to characterize the behavior of our proposed functions of
bandwidth.
