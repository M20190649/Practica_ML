A General Method for Robust Bayesian Modeling
Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models,
providing protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from
the model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a
case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture
models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to
robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a
robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use
our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear
regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic
models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches,
especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.
