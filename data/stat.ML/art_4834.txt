Ballpark Learning: Estimating Labels from Rough Group Comparisons
We are interested in estimating individual labels given only coarse,
aggregated signal over the data points. In our setting, we receive sets
("bags") of unlabeled instances with constraints on label proportions. We relax
the unrealistic assumption of known label proportions, made in previous work;
instead, we assume only to have upper and lower bounds, and constraints on bag
differences. We motivate the problem, propose an intuitive formulation and
algorithm, and apply our methods to real-world scenarios. Across several
domains, we show how using only proportion constraints and no labeled examples,
we can achieve surprisingly high accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate how to
predict income level using rough stereotypes and how to perform sentiment
analysis using very little information. We also apply our method to guide
exploratory analysis, recovering geographical differences in twitter dialect.
