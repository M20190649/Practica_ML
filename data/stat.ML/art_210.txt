Learning Loosely Connected Markov Random Fields
We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call
loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths
between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence
test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel
maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected
correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples
required by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and the
constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several
previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random
fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity
than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new
results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns
general Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly with
running time O(np^5).
