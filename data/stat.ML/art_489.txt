A Nonparametric Adaptive Nonlinear Statistical Filter
We use statistical learning methods to construct an adaptive state estimator
for nonlinear stochastic systems. Optimal state estimation, in the form of a
Kalman filter, requires knowledge of the system's process and measurement
uncertainty. We propose that these uncertainties can be estimated from
(conditioned on) past observed data, and without making any assumptions of the
system's prior distribution. The system's prior distribution at each time step
is constructed from an ensemble of least-squares estimates on sub-sampled sets
of the data via jackknife sampling. As new data is acquired, the state
estimates, process uncertainty, and measurement uncertainty are updated
accordingly, as described in this manuscript.
