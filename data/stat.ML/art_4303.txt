Long-Term Online Smoothing Prediction Using Expert Advice
For the prediction with experts' advice setting, we construct forecasting
algorithms that suffer loss not much more than any expert in the pool. In
contrast to the standard approach, we investigate the case of long-term
forecasting of time series and consider two scenarios. In the first one, at
each step $t$ the learner has to combine the point forecasts of the experts
issued for the time interval $[t+1, t+d]$ ahead. Our approach implies that at
each time step experts issue point forecasts for arbitrary many steps ahead and
then the learner (algorithm) combines these forecasts and the forecasts made
earlier into one vector forecast for steps $[t+1,t+d]$. By combining past and
the current long-term forecasts we obtain a smoothing mechanism that protects
our algorithm from temporary trend changes, noise and outliers. In the second
scenario, at each step $t$ experts issue a prediction function, and the learner
has to combine these functions into the single one, which will be used for
long-term time-series prediction. For each scenario, we develop an algorithm
for combining experts forecasts and prove $O(\ln T)$ adversarial regret upper
bound for both algorithms.
