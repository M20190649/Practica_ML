Variational Semi-blind Sparse Deconvolution with Orthogonal Kernel Bases
  and its Application to MRFM
We present a variational Bayesian method of joint image reconstruction and
point spread function (PSF) estimation when the PSF of the imaging device is
only partially known. To solve this semi-blind deconvolution problem, prior
distributions are specified for the PSF and the 3D image. Joint image
reconstruction and PSF estimation is then performed within a Bayesian
framework, using a variational algorithm to estimate the posterior
distribution. The image prior distribution imposes an explicit atomic measure
that corresponds to image sparsity. Importantly, the proposed Bayesian
deconvolution algorithm does not require hand tuning. Simulation results
clearly demonstrate that the semi-blind deconvolution algorithm compares
favorably with previous Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) version of myopic
sparse reconstruction. It significantly outperforms mismatched non-blind
algorithms that rely on the assumption of the perfect knowledge of the PSF. The
algorithm is illustrated on real data from magnetic resonance force microscopy
(MRFM).
