Monte Carlo Structured SVI for Two-Level Non-Conjugate Models
The stochastic variational inference (SVI) paradigm, which combines
variational inference, natural gradients, and stochastic updates, was recently
proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and
demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family
of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but
without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this
context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured
variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than
previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating
variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting
approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope
of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with
latent Gaussian variables we propose a hybrid algorithm, using both standard
and natural gradients, which is shown to improve stability and convergence.
Applications in mixed effects models, sparse Gaussian processes, probabilistic
matrix factorization and correlated topic models demonstrate the generality of
the approach and the advantages of the proposed algorithms.
