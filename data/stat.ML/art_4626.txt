Markov models for ocular fixation locations in the presence and absence
  of colour
We propose to model the fixation locations of the human eye when observing a
still image by a Markovian point process in R 2 . Our approach is data driven
using k-means clustering of the fixation locations to identify distinct salient
regions of the image, which in turn correspond to the states of our Markov
chain. Bayes factors are computed as model selection criterion to determine the
number of clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behaviour of the human
eye differs from this model when colour information is removed from the given
image.
