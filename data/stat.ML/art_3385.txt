PeakSegJoint: fast supervised peak detection via joint segmentation of
  multiple count data samples
Joint peak detection is a central problem when comparing samples in genomic
data analysis, but current algorithms for this task are unsupervised and
limited to at most 2 sample types. We propose PeakSegJoint, a new constrained
maximum likelihood segmentation model for any number of sample types. To select
the number of peaks in the segmentation, we propose a supervised penalty
learning model. To infer the parameters of these two models, we propose to use
a discrete optimization heuristic for the segmentation, and convex optimization
for the penalty learning. In comparisons with state-of-the-art peak detection
algorithms, PeakSegJoint achieves similar accuracy, faster speeds, and a more
interpretable model with overlapping peaks that occur in exactly the same
positions across all samples.
