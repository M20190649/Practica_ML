PAC-Bayesian Analysis for a two-step Hierarchical Multiview Learning
  Approach
We study a two-level multiview learning with more than two views under the
PAC-Bayesian framework. This approach, sometimes referred as late fusion,
consists in learning sequentially multiple view-specific classifiers at the
first level, and then combining these view-specific classifiers at the second
level. Our main theoretical result is a generalization bound on the risk of the
majority vote which exhibits a term of diversity in the predictions of the
view-specific classifiers. From this result it comes out that controlling the
trade-off between diversity and accuracy is a key element for multiview
learning, which complements other results in multiview learning. Finally, we
experiment our principle on multiview datasets extracted from the Reuters
RCV1/RCV2 collection.
