An Adaptive Resample-Move Algorithm for Estimating Normalizing Constants
The estimation of normalizing constants is a fundamental step in
probabilistic model comparison. Sequential Monte Carlo methods may be used for
this task and have the advantage of being inherently parallelizable. However,
the standard choice of using a fixed number of particles at each iteration is
suboptimal because some steps will contribute disproportionately to the
variance of the estimate. We introduce an adaptive version of the Resample-Move
algorithm, in which the particle set is adaptively expanded whenever a better
approximation of an intermediate distribution is needed. The algorithm builds
on the expression for the optimal number of particles and the corresponding
minimum variance found under ideal conditions. Benchmark results on challenging
Gaussian Process Classification and Restricted Boltzmann Machine applications
show that Adaptive Resample-Move (ARM) estimates the normalizing constant with
a smaller variance, using less computational resources, than either
Resample-Move with a fixed number of particles or Annealed Importance Sampling.
A further advantage over Annealed Importance Sampling is that ARM is easier to
tune.
