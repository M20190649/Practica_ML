Shape Parameter Estimation
Performance of machine learning approaches depends strongly on the choice of
misfit penalty, and correct choice of penalty parameters, such as the threshold
of the Huber function. These parameters are typically chosen using expert
knowledge, cross-validation, or black-box optimization, which are time
consuming for large-scale applications. We present a principled, data-driven
approach to simultaneously learn the model pa- rameters and the misfit penalty
parameters. We discuss theoretical properties of these joint inference
problems, and develop algorithms for their solution. We show synthetic examples
of automatic parameter tuning for piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ) penalties,
and use the approach to develop a self-tuning robust PCA formulation for
background separation.
