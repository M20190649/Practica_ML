A statistical perspective of sampling scores for linear regression
In this paper, we consider a statistical problem of learning a linear model
from noisy samples. Existing work has focused on approximating the least
squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling
distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no
computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To
evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we
propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical
analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean
square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on
minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for
both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the
noise-to-signal ratio. Numerical simulations match the theoretical analysis
well.
