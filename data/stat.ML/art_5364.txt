A Unifying View of Explicit and Implicit Feature Maps of Graph Kernels
Non-linear kernel methods can be approximated by fast linear ones using
suitable explicit feature maps allowing their application to large scale
problems. We investigate how convolution kernels for structured data are
composed from base kernels and construct corresponding feature maps. On this
basis we propose exact and approximative feature maps for widely used graph
kernels based on the kernel trick. We analyze for which kernels and graph
properties computation by explicit feature maps is feasible and actually more
efficient. In particular, we derive approximative, explicit feature maps for
state-of-the-art kernels supporting real-valued attributes including the
GraphHopper and graph invariant kernels. In extensive experiments we show that
our approaches often achieve a classification accuracy close to the exact
methods based on the kernel trick, but require only a fraction of their running
time. Moreover, we propose and analyze algorithms for computing random walk,
shortest-path and subgraph matching kernels by explicit and implicit feature
maps. Our theoretical results are confirmed experimentally by observing a phase
transition when comparing running time with respect to label diversity, walk
lengths and subgraph size, respectively.
