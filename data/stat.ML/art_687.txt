Modularity Component Analysis versus Principal Component Analysis
In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvectors of
the modularity matrix and the singular vectors of an uncentered data matrix is
developed. Based on this analysis the concept of a modularity component is
defined, and its properties are developed. It is shown that modularity
component analysis can be used to cluster data similar to how traditional
principal component analysis is used except that modularity component analysis
does not require data centering.
