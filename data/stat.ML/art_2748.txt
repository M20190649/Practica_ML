Inference in High Dimensions with the Penalized Score Test
In recent years, there has been considerable theoretical development
regarding variable selection consistency of penalized regression techniques,
such as the lasso. However, there has been relatively little work on
quantifying the uncertainty in these selection procedures. In this paper, we
propose a new method for inference in high dimensions using a score test based
on penalized regression. In this test, we perform penalized regression of an
outcome on all but a single feature, and test for correlation of the residuals
with the held-out feature. This procedure is applied to each feature in turn.
Interestingly, when an $\ell_1$ penalty is used, the sparsity pattern of the
lasso corresponds exactly to a decision based on the proposed test. Further,
when an $\ell_2$ penalty is used, the test corresponds precisely to a score
test in a mixed effects model, in which the effects of all but one feature are
assumed to be random. We formulate the hypothesis being tested as a compromise
between the null hypotheses tested in simple linear regression on each feature
and in multiple linear regression on all features, and develop reference
distributions for some well-known penalties. We also examine the behavior of
the test on real and simulated data.
