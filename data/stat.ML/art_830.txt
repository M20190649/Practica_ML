Parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian processes (SpInGP)
We propose a parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian process
(SpInGP) for temporal models. It uses a sparse precision GP formulation and
sparse matrix routines to speed up the computations. Due to the state-space
formulation used in the algorithm, the time complexity of the basic SpInGP is
linear, and because all the computations are parallelizable, the parallel form
of the algorithm is sublinear in the number of data points. We provide example
algorithms to implement the sparse matrix routines and experimentally test the
method using both simulated and real data.
