A Dynamic Bayesian Network Model for Inventory Level Estimation in
  Retail Marketing
Many retailers today employ inventory management systems based on Re-Order
Point Policies, most of which rely on the assumption that all decreases in
product inventory levels result from product sales. Unfortunately, it usually
happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or
broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting.
This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products,
e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock
freezing problems, i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is
above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no
replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the
interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved
(i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale
and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic
program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear
programs for the M-step.
