Co-adaptive learning over a countable space
Co-adaptation is a special form of on-line learning where an algorithm
$\mathcal{A}$ must assist an unknown algorithm $\mathcal{B}$ to perform some
task. This is a general framework and has applications in recommendation
systems, search, education, and much more. Today, the most common use of
co-adaptive algorithms is in brain-computer interfacing (BCI), where algorithms
help patients gain and maintain control over prosthetic devices. While previous
studies have shown strong empirical results Kowalski et al. (2013); Orsborn et
al. (2014) or have been studied in specific examples Merel et al. (2013, 2015),
there is no general analysis of the co-adaptive learning problem. Here we will
study the co-adaptive learning problem in the online, closed-loop setting. We
will prove that, with high probability, co-adaptive learning is guaranteed to
outperform learning with a fixed decoder as long as a particular condition is
met.
