Reparameterizing the Birkhoff Polytope for Variational Permutation
  Inference
Many matching, tracking, sorting, and ranking problems require probabilistic
reasoning about possible permutations, a set that grows factorially with
dimension. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point
estimation, but fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this
high-dimensional, discrete space. To surmount this challenge, we start with the
usual step of relaxing a discrete set (here, of permutation matrices) to its
convex hull, which here is the Birkhoff polytope: the set of all
doubly-stochastic matrices. We then introduce two novel transformations: first,
an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps
unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope; second, a map that rounds points
toward the vertices of the polytope. Both transformations include a temperature
parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on permutation
matrices. We then exploit these transformations and reparameterization
gradients to introduce variational inference over permutation matrices, and we
demonstrate its utility in a series of experiments.
