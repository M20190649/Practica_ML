Exact Estimation of Multiple Directed Acyclic Graphs
This paper considers the problem of estimating the structure of multiple
related directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. Building on recent developments in
exact estimation of DAGs using integer linear programming (ILP), we present an
ILP approach for joint estimation over multiple DAGs, that does not require
that the vertices in each DAG share a common ordering. Furthermore, we allow
also for (potentially unknown) dependency structure between the DAGs. Results
are presented on both simulated data and fMRI data obtained from multiple
subjects.
