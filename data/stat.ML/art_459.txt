Raiders of the Lost Architecture: Kernels for Bayesian Optimization in
  Conditional Parameter Spaces
In practical Bayesian optimization, we must often search over structures with
differing numbers of parameters. For instance, we may wish to search over
neural network architectures with an unknown number of layers. To relate
performance data gathered for different architectures, we define a new kernel
for conditional parameter spaces that explicitly includes information about
which parameters are relevant in a given structure. We show that this kernel
improves model quality and Bayesian optimization results over several simpler
baseline kernels.
