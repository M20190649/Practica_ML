Detecting confounding in multivariate linear models via spectral
  analysis
We study a model where one target variable Y is correlated with a vector
X:=(X_1,...,X_d) of predictor variables being potential causes of Y. We
describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences
between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a
hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration
of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption
stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression
coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has `generic
orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the
special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils
this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to
quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding.
