Dimensionality Reduction for Binary Data through the Projection of
  Natural Parameters
Principal component analysis (PCA) for binary data, known as logistic PCA,
has become a popular alternative to dimensionality reduction of binary data. It
is motivated as an extension of ordinary PCA by means of a matrix
factorization, akin to the singular value decomposition, that maximizes the
Bernoulli log-likelihood. We propose a new formulation of logistic PCA which
extends Pearson's formulation of a low dimensional data representation with
minimum error to binary data. Our formulation does not require a matrix
factorization, as previous methods do, but instead looks for projections of the
natural parameters from the saturated model. Due to this difference, the number
of parameters does not grow with the number of observations and the principal
component scores on new data can be computed with simple matrix multiplication.
We derive explicit solutions for data matrices of special structure and provide
computationally efficient algorithms for solving for the principal component
loadings. Through simulation experiments and an analysis of medical diagnoses
data, we compare our formulation of logistic PCA to the previous formulation as
well as ordinary PCA to demonstrate its benefits.
