A Kernel Independence Test for Random Processes
A new non parametric approach to the problem of testing the independence of
two random process is developed. The test statistic is the Hilbert Schmidt
Independence Criterion (HSIC), which was used previously in testing
independence for i.i.d pairs of variables. The asymptotic behaviour of HSIC is
established when computed from samples drawn from random processes. It is shown
that earlier bootstrap procedures which worked in the i.i.d. case will fail for
random processes, and an alternative consistent estimate of the p-values is
proposed. Tests on artificial data and real-world Forex data indicate that the
new test procedure discovers dependence which is missed by linear approaches,
while the earlier bootstrap procedure returns an elevated number of false
positives. The code is available online:
