Dependence Modeling in Ultra High Dimensions with Vine Copulas and the
  Graphical Lasso
To model high dimensional data, Gaussian methods are widely used since they
remain tractable and yield parsimonious models by imposing strong assumptions
on the data. Vine copulas are more flexible by combining arbitrary marginal
distributions and (conditional) bivariate copulas. Yet, this adaptability is
accompanied by sharply increasing computational effort as the dimension
increases. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes this burden and makes
the first step into ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence modeling by
using a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we apply Gaussian methods to split
datasets into feasibly small subsets and second, apply parsimonious and
flexible vine copulas thereon. Finally, we reconcile them into one joint model.
We provide numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in
moderate dimensions and showcase its ability to estimate ultra high dimensional
non-Gaussian dependence models in thousands of dimensions.
