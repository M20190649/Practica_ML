An Efficient ADMM Algorithm for Structural Break Detection in
  Multivariate Time Series
We present an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm for segmenting a multivariate non-stationary time series with
structural breaks into stationary regions. We draw from recent work where the
series is assumed to follow a vector autoregressive model within segments and a
convex estimation procedure may be formulated using group fused lasso
penalties. Our ADMM approach first splits the convex problem into a global
quadratic program and a simple group lasso proximal update. We show that the
global problem may be parallelized over rows of the time dependent transition
matrices and furthermore that each subproblem may be rewritten in a form
identical to the log-likelihood of a Gaussian state space model. Consequently,
we develop a Kalman smoothing algorithm to solve the global update in time
linear in the length of the series.
