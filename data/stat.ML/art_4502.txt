Graph Matching: Relax at Your Own Risk
Graph matching---aligning a pair of graphs to minimize their edge
disagreements---has received wide-spread attention from both theoretical and
applied communities over the past several decades, including combinatorics,
computer vision, and connectomics. Its attention can be partially attributed to
its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been
proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have
any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax
the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners
to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite
relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal
permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover
the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing
the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical
performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these
theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both
benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.
