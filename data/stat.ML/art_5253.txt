Prediction of Kidney Function from Biopsy Images Using Convolutional
  Neural Networks
A Convolutional Neural Network was used to predict kidney function in
patients with chronic kidney disease from high-resolution digital pathology
scans of their kidney biopsies. Kidney biopsies were taken from participants of
the NEPTUNE study, a longitudinal cohort study whose goal is to set up
infrastructure for observing the evolution of 3 forms of idiopathic nephrotic
syndrome, including developing predictors for progression of kidney disease.
The knowledge of future kidney function is desirable as it can identify
high-risk patients and influence treatment decisions, reducing the likelihood
of irreversible kidney decline.
