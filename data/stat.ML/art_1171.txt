Stable Recovery Of Sparse Vectors From Random Sinusoidal Feature Maps
Random sinusoidal features are a popular approach for speeding up
kernel-based inference in large datasets. Prior to the inference stage, the
approach suggests performing dimensionality reduction by first multiplying each
data vector by a random Gaussian matrix, and then computing an element-wise
sinusoid. Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of
such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel
classification and regression.
  In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of
the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such
random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough.
In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the
data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity.
Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems,
such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors. We support the
efficacy of our approach via numerical experiments.
