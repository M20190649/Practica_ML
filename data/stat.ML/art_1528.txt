Conditional Density Estimation with Bayesian Normalising Flows
Modeling complex conditional distributions is critical in a variety of
settings. Despite a long tradition of research into conditional density
estimation, current methods employ either simple parametric forms or are
difficult to learn in practice. This paper employs normalising flows as a
flexible likelihood model and presents an efficient method for fitting them to
complex densities. These estimators must trade-off between modeling
distributional complexity, functional complexity and heteroscedasticity without
overfitting. We recognize these trade-offs as modeling decisions and develop a
Bayesian framework for placing priors over these conditional density estimators
using variational Bayesian neural networks. We evaluate this method on several
small benchmark regression datasets, on some of which it obtains state of the
art performance. Finally, we apply the method to two spatial density modeling
tasks with over 1 million datapoints using the New York City yellow taxi
dataset and the Chicago crime dataset.
