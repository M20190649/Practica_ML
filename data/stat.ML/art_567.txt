A Bennett Inequality for the Missing Mass
Novel concentration inequalities are obtained for the missing mass, i.e. the
total probability mass of the outcomes not observed in the sample. We derive
distribution-free deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size
for missing mass and improve the results of Berend and Kontorovich (2013) and
Yari Saeed Khanloo and Haffari (2015) for small deviations which is the most
important case in learning theory.
