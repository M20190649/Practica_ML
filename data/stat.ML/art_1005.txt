A Unified Framework for Sparse Non-Negative Least Squares using
  Multiplicative Updates and the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Problem
We study the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. S-NNLS
occurs naturally in a wide variety of applications where an unknown,
non-negative quantity must be recovered from linear measurements. We present a
unified framework for S-NNLS based on a rectified power exponential scale
mixture prior on the sparse codes. We show that the proposed framework
encompasses a large class of S-NNLS algorithms and provide a computationally
efficient inference procedure based on multiplicative update rules. Such update
rules are convenient for solving large sets of S-NNLS problems simultaneously,
which is required in contexts like sparse non-negative matrix factorization
(S-NMF). We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach by
showing that the local minima of the objective function being optimized are
sparse and the S-NNLS algorithms presented are guaranteed to converge to a set
of stationary points of the objective function. We then extend our framework to
S-NMF, showing that our framework leads to many well known S-NMF algorithms
under specific choices of prior and providing a guarantee that a popular
subclass of the proposed algorithms converges to a set of stationary points of
the objective function. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed
approaches on synthetic and real-world data.
