Variational Bayes Factor Analysis for i-Vector Extraction
In this document we are going to derive the equations needed to implement a
Variational Bayes i-vector extractor. This can be used to extract longer
i-vectors reducing the risk of overfittig or to adapt an i-vector extractor
from a database to another with scarce development data. This work is based on
Patrick Kenny's joint factor analysis and Christopher Bishop's variational
principal components.
