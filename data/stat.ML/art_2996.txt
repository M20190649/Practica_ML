Large-scale randomized-coordinate descent methods with non-separable
  linear constraints
We develop randomized (block) coordinate descent (CD) methods for linearly
constrained convex optimization. Unlike most CD methods, we do not assume the
constraints to be separable, but let them be coupled linearly. To our
knowledge, ours is the first CD method that allows linear coupling constraints,
without making the global iteration complexity have an exponential dependence
on the number of constraints. We present algorithms and analysis for four key
problem scenarios: (i) smooth; (ii) smooth + nonsmooth separable; (iii)
asynchronous parallel; and (iv) stochastic. We illustrate empirical behavior of
our algorithms by simulation experiments.
