k-Means Clustering Is Matrix Factorization
We show that the objective function of conventional k-means clustering can be
expressed as the Frobenius norm of the difference of a data matrix and a low
rank approximation of that data matrix. In short, we show that k-means
clustering is a matrix factorization problem. These notes are meant as a
reference and intended to provide a guided tour towards a result that is often
mentioned but seldom made explicit in the literature.
