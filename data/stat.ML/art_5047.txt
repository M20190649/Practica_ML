Multiple protein feature prediction with statistical relational learning
High throughput sequencing techniques have highly impactedon modern biology,
widening the gap between sequenced andannotated data. Automatic annotation
tools are thereforeof the foremost importance to guide biologists' experiments.
However, most of the state-of-the-art methods rely on annotation transfer,
offering reliable predictions only in homology settings. In this work we
present a novel appraoch to protein feature prediction, which exploits the
Semanti Based Regularization to inject prior knowledge in the learning process.
The experimental results conducted on the yeast genome show that the
introduction of the constraints positively impacts on the overall prediction
quality.
