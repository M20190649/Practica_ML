Tight Performance Bounds for Compressed Sensing With Conventional and
  Group Sparsity
In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a group sparse vector from
a small number of linear measurements. In the past the common approach has been
to use various "group sparsity-inducing" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for
this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is
also possible to use $\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We
introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and
show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted
isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse
recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative
than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where where
the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our
bounds reduce to one of the well-known "best possible" conditions for sparse
recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional
sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using
this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error
vector for all $p \in [1,2]$, and not just when $p = 2$. When the measurement
matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present
bounds on the number of measurements, which are less conservative than
currently known bounds.
