The Phylogenetic LASSO and the Microbiome
Scientific investigations that incorporate next generation sequencing involve
analyses of high-dimensional data where the need to organize, collate and
interpret the outcomes are pressingly important. Currently, data can be
collected at the microbiome level leading to the possibility of personalized
medicine whereby treatments can be tailored at this scale. In this paper, we
lay down a statistical framework for this type of analysis with a view toward
synthesis of products tailored to individual patients. Although the paper
applies the technique to data for a particular infectious disease, the
methodology is sufficiently rich to be expanded to other problems in medicine,
especially those in which coincident `-omics' covariates and clinical responses
are simultaneously captured.
