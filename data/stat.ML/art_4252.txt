Sampling and Reconstruction of Graph Signals via Weak Submodularity and
  Semidefinite Relaxation
We study the problem of sampling a bandlimited graph signal in the presence
of noise, where the objective is to select a node subset of prescribed
cardinality that minimizes the signal reconstruction mean squared error (MSE).
To that end, we formulate the task at hand as the minimization of MSE subject
to binary constraints, and approximate the resulting NP-hard problem via
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Moreover, we provide an alternative
formulation based on maximizing a monotone weak submodular function and propose
a randomized-greedy algorithm to find a sub-optimal subset. We then derive a
worst-case performance guarantee on the MSE returned by the randomized greedy
algorithm for general non-stationary graph signals. The efficacy of the
proposed methods is illustrated through numerical simulations on synthetic and
real-world graphs. Notably, the randomized greedy algorithm yields an
order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art greedy sampling schemes, while
incurring only a marginal MSE performance loss.
