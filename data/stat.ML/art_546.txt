Monte Carlo Planning method estimates planning horizons during
  interactive social exchange
Reciprocating interactions represent a central feature of all human
exchanges. They have been the target of various recent experiments, with
healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in
multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such
exchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity
with their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs
about the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan
different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise
account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what
underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive
partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various
complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we
show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a
variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the
algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert
observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate
the richness and sophistication of interactive inference.
