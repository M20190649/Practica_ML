Sparse Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis via $\ell_1$-regularization
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical technique
for finding the linear relationship between two sets of variables. The kernel
generalization of CCA named kernel CCA has been proposed to find nonlinear
relations between datasets. Despite their wide usage, they have one common
limitation that is the lack of sparsity in their solution. In this paper, we
consider sparse kernel CCA and propose a novel sparse kernel CCA algorithm
(SKCCA). Our algorithm is based on a relationship between kernel CCA and least
squares. Sparsity of the dual transformations is introduced by penalizing the
$\ell_{1}$-norm of dual vectors. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm not
only performs well in computing sparse dual transformations but also can
alleviate the over-fitting problem of kernel CCA.
