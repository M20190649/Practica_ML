Scalable Gaussian Processes for Characterizing Multidimensional Change
  Surfaces
We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and
characterizing smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning
changes in expressive covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features
to flexibly define a change surface in combination with expressive spectral
mixture kernels to capture the complex statistical structure. Finally, through
the use of novel methods for additive non-separable kernels, we can scale the
model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical and real world
data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we identify
previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time.
