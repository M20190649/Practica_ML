Causal Compression
We propose a new method of discovering causal relationships in temporal data
based on the notion of causal compression. To this end, we adopt the Pearlian
graph setting and the directed information as an information theoretic tool for
quantifying causality. We introduce chain rule for directed information and use
it to motivate causal sparsity. We show two applications of the proposed
method: causal time series segmentation which selects time points capturing the
incoming and outgoing causal flow between time points belonging to different
signals, and causal bipartite graph recovery. We prove that modelling of
causality in the adopted set-up only requires estimating the copula density of
the data distribution and thus does not depend on its marginals. We evaluate
the method on time resolved gene expression data.
