Median-Truncated Nonconvex Approach for Phase Retrieval with Outliers
This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a
signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. We develop statistically
and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the
measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values.
We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by
using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in
initialization and local search. Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped
quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and
median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal
number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d.
Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of
the measurements are adversarially corrupted. We further show that both
algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise. Our
analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of
median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest. We provide
numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
