Top-down Transformation Choice
Simple models are preferred over complex models, but over-simplistic models
could lead to erroneous interpretations. The classical approach is to start
with a simple model, whose shortcomings are assessed in residual-based model
diagnostics. Eventually, one increases the complexity of this initial overly
simple model and obtains a better-fitting model. I illustrate how
transformation analysis can be used as an alternative approach to model choice.
Instead of adding complexity to simple models, step-wise complexity reduction
is used to help identify simpler and better-interpretable models. As an
example, body mass index distributions in Switzerland are modelled by means of
transformation models to understand the impact of sex, age, smoking and other
lifestyle factors on a person's body mass index. In this process, I searched
for a compromise between model fit and model interpretability. Special emphasis
is given to the understanding of the connections between transformation models
of increasing complexity. The models used in this analysis ranged from
evergreens, such as the normal linear regression model with constant variance,
to novel models with extremely flexible conditional distribution functions,
such as transformation trees and transformation forests.
