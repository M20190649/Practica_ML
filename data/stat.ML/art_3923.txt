Decision trees unearth return sign correlation in the S&P 500
Technical trading rules and linear regressive models are often used by
practitioners to find trends in financial data. However, these models are
unsuited to find non-linearly separable patterns. We propose a decision tree
forecasting model that has the flexibility to capture arbitrary patterns. To
illustrate, we construct a binary Markov process with a deterministic component
that cannot be predicted with an autoregressive process. A simulation study
confirms the robustness of the trees and limitation of the autoregressive
model. Finally, adjusting for multiple testing, we show that some tree based
strategies achieve trading performance significant at the 99% confidence level
on the S&P 500 over the past 20 years. The best strategy breaks even with the
buy-and-hold strategy at 21 bps in transaction costs per round trip. A
four-factor regression analysis shows significant intercept and correlation
with the market. The return anomalies are strongest during the bursts of the
dotcom bubble, financial crisis, and European debt crisis. The correlation of
the return signs during these periods confirms the theoretical model.
