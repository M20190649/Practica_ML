On the Application of Support Vector Machines to the Prediction of
  Propagation Losses at 169 MHz for Smart Metering Applications
Recently, the need of deploying new wireless networks for smart gas metering
has raised the problem of radio planning in the169 MHz band. Unluckily,
software tools commonly adopted for radio planning in cellular communication
systems cannot be employed to solve this problem because of the substantially
lower transmission frequencies characterizing this application. In this
manuscript a novel data-centric solution, based on the use of support vector
machine techniques for classification and regression, is proposed. Our method
requires the availability of a limited set of received signal strength
measurements and the knowledge of a three-dimensional map of the propagation
environment of interest, and generates both an estimate of the coverage area
and a prediction of the field strength within it. Numerical results referring
to different Italian villages and cities evidence that our method is able to
achieve good accuracy at the price of an acceptable computational cost and of a
limited effort for the acquisition of measurements in the considered
environments.
