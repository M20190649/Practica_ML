Exact Sampling of Determinantal Point Processes without
  Eigendecomposition
Determinantal point processes (DPPs) enable the modeling of repulsion: they
provide diverse sets of points. The repulsion is encoded in a kernel $K$ that
can be seen as a matrix storing the similarity between points. The diversity
comes from the fact that the inclusion probability of a subset is equal to the
determinant of a submatrice of $K$. The exact algorithm to sample DPPs uses the
spectral decomposition of $K$, a computation that becomes costly when dealing
with a high number of points. Here, we present an alternative exact algorithm
in the discrete setting that avoids the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors
computation. Instead, it relies on Cholesky decompositions. This is a two steps
strategy: first, it samples a Bernoulli point process with an appropriate
distribution, then it samples the target DPP distribution through a thinning
procedure. Not only is the method used here innovative, but this algorithm can
be competitive with the original algorithm or even faster for some applications
specified below.
