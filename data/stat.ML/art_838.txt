Rapid Posterior Exploration in Bayesian Non-negative Matrix
  Factorization
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular tool for data
exploration. Bayesian NMF promises to also characterize uncertainty in the
factorization. Unfortunately, current inference approaches such as MCMC mix
slowly and tend to get stuck on single modes. We introduce a novel approach
using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) to asymptotically cover regions of
high posterior density. These are placed in a principled Bayesian framework via
an online extension to nonparametric variational inference. On experiments on
real and synthetic data, we obtain greater coverage of the posterior and higher
ELBO values than standard NMF inference approaches.
