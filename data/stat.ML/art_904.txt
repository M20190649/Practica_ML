Bayesian Semisupervised Learning with Deep Generative Models
Neural network based generative models with discriminative components are a
powerful approach for semi-supervised learning. However, these techniques a)
cannot account for model uncertainty in the estimation of the model's
discriminative component and b) lack flexibility to capture complex stochastic
patterns in the label generation process. To avoid these problems, we first
propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased
noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can
marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model.
Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and
produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values. This opens the door
for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning.
