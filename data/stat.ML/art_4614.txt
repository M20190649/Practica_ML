Variational inference for rare variant detection in deep, heterogeneous
  next-generation sequencing data
The detection of rare variants is important for understanding the genetic
heterogeneity in mixed samples. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have enabled the identification of single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) in mixed samples with high resolution. Yet, the noise inherent in the
biological processes involved in next-generation sequencing necessitates the
use of statistical methods to identify true rare variants. We propose a novel
Bayesian statistical model and a variational expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs
in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM
algorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more
computationally efficient on tests of low coverage ($27\times$ and $298\times$)
data. Furthermore, we show that our model with a variational EM inference
algorithm has higher specificity than many state-of-the-art algorithms. In an
analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to
identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel
variants that have not yet been reported. Our model also detects the emergence
of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a pair of
concomitant variants.
