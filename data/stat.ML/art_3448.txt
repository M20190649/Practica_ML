Analyzing statistical and computational tradeoffs of estimation
  procedures
The recent explosion in the amount and dimensionality of data has exacerbated
the need of trading off computational and statistical efficiency carefully, so
that inference is both tractable and meaningful. We propose a framework that
provides an explicit opportunity for practitioners to specify how much
statistical risk they are willing to accept for a given computational cost, and
leads to a theoretical risk-computation frontier for any given inference
problem. We illustrate the tradeoff between risk and computation and illustrate
the frontier in three distinct settings. First, we derive analytic forms for
the risk of estimating parameters in the classical setting of estimating the
mean and variance for normally distributed data and for the more general
setting of parameters of an exponential family. The second example concentrates
on computationally constrained Hodges-Lehmann estimators. We conclude with an
evaluation of risk associated with early termination of iterative matrix
inversion algorithms in the context of linear regression.
