Simultaneous Matrix Diagonalization for Structural Brain Networks
  Classification
This paper considers the problem of brain disease classification based on
connectome data. A connectome is a network representation of a human brain. The
typical connectome classification problem is very challenging because of the
small sample size and high dimensionality of the data. We propose to use
simultaneous approximate diagonalization of adjacency matrices in order to
compute their eigenstructures in more stable way. The obtained approximate
eigenvalues are further used as features for classification. The proposed
approach is demonstrated to be efficient for detection of Alzheimer's disease,
outperforming simple baselines and competing with state-of-the-art approaches
to brain disease classification.
