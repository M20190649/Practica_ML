On Semiparametric Exponential Family Graphical Models
We propose a new class of semiparametric exponential family graphical models
for the analysis of high dimensional mixed data. Different from the existing
mixed graphical models, we allow the nodewise conditional distributions to be
semiparametric generalized linear models with unspecified base measure
functions. Thus, one advantage of our method is that it is unnecessary to
specify the type of each node and the method is more convenient to apply in
practice. Under the proposed model, we consider both problems of parameter
estimation and hypothesis testing in high dimensions. In particular, we propose
a symmetric pairwise score test for the presence of a single edge in the graph.
Compared to the existing methods for hypothesis tests, our approach takes into
account of the symmetry of the parameters, such that the inferential results
are invariant with respect to the different parametrizations of the same edge.
Thorough numerical simulations and a real data example are provided to back up
our results.
