A new class of metrics for learning on real-valued and structured data
We propose a new class of metrics on sets, vectors, and functions that can be
used in various stages of data mining, including exploratory data analysis,
learning, and result interpretation. These new distance functions unify and
generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances
on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance
on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show
useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To
further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies
and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic
graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct
empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new
metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and
structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new
metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions
traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the
fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two
correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is
particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and
structured data in distance-based learning.
