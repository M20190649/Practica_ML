Identifying Outliers using Influence Function of Multiple Kernel
  Canonical Correlation Analysis
Imaging genetic research has essentially focused on discovering unique and
co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical
objects in genetic as well as non-genetics variables. Identifying significant
outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and
multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription
errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of
kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance
operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple
kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be
applied for more than two datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to
detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of
kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable
of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in
which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the
stem-and-leaf display. Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics
data (e.g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed
visualization can be applied effectively.
