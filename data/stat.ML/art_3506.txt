Adaptive Smoothing Algorithms for Nonsmooth Composite Convex
  Minimization
We propose an adaptive smoothing algorithm based on Nesterov's smoothing
technique in \cite{Nesterov2005c} for solving "fully" nonsmooth composite
convex optimization problems. Our method combines both Nesterov's accelerated
proximal gradient scheme and a new homotopy strategy for smoothness parameter.
By an appropriate choice of smoothing functions, we develop a new algorithm
that has the $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$-worst-case
iteration-complexity while preserves the same complexity-per-iteration as in
Nesterov's method and allows one to automatically update the smoothness
parameter at each iteration. Then, we customize our algorithm to solve four
special cases that cover various applications. We also specify our algorithm to
solve constrained convex optimization problems and show its convergence
guarantee on a primal sequence of iterates. We demonstrate our algorithm
through three numerical examples and compare it with other related algorithms.
