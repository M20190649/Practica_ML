Variational Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via Score Matching
Traditionally, the field of computational Bayesian statistics has been
divided into two main subfields: variational methods and Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC). In recent years, however, several methods have been proposed
based on combining variational Bayesian inference and MCMC simulation in order
to improve their overall accuracy and computational efficiency. This marriage
of fast evaluation and flexible approximation provides a promising means of
designing scalable Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we explore the
possibility of incorporating variational approximation into a state-of-the-art
MCMC method, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), to reduce the required gradient
computation in the simulation of Hamiltonian flow, which is the bottleneck for
many applications of HMC in big data problems. To this end, we use a {\it
free-form} approximation induced by a fast and flexible surrogate function
based on single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks. The surrogate
provides sufficiently accurate approximation while allowing for fast
exploration of parameter space, resulting in an efficient approximate inference
algorithm. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on both synthetic and
real data problems.
