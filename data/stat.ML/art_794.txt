Clustering Time-Series Energy Data from Smart Meters
Investigations have been performed into using clustering methods in data
mining time-series data from smart meters. The problem is to identify patterns
and trends in energy usage profiles of commercial and industrial customers over
24-hour periods, and group similar profiles. We tested our method on energy
usage data provided by several U.S. power utilities. The results show accurate
grouping of accounts similar in their energy usage patterns, and potential for
the method to be utilized in energy efficiency programs.
