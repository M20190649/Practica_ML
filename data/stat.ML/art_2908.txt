Convex Analysis of Mixtures for Separating Non-negative Well-grounded
  Sources
Blind Source Separation (BSS) has proven to be a powerful tool for the
analysis of composite patterns in engineering and science. We introduce Convex
Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) for separating non-negative well-grounded sources,
which learns the mixing matrix by identifying the lateral edges of the convex
data scatter plot. We prove a sufficient and necessary condition for
identifying the mixing matrix through edge detection, which also serves as the
foundation for CAM to be applied not only to the exact-determined and
over-determined cases, but also to the under-determined case. We show the
optimality of the edge detection strategy, even for cases where source
well-groundedness is not strictly satisfied. The CAM algorithm integrates
plug-in noise filtering using sector-based clustering, an efficient geometric
convex analysis scheme, and stability-based model order selection. We
demonstrate the principle of CAM on simulated data and numerically mixed
natural images. The superior performance of CAM against a panel of benchmark
BSS techniques is demonstrated on numerically mixed gene expression data. We
then apply CAM to dissect dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
data taken from breast tumors and time-course microarray gene expression data
derived from in-vivo muscle regeneration in mice, both producing biologically
plausible decomposition results.
