Admissibility of a posterior predictive decision rule
Recent decades have seen an interest in prediction problems for which
Bayesian methodology has been used ubiquitously. Sampling from or approximating
the posterior predictive distribution in a Bayesian model allows one to make
inferential statements about potentially observable random quantities given
observed data. The purpose of this note is to use statistical decision theory
as a basis to justify the use of a posterior predictive distribution for making
a point prediction.
