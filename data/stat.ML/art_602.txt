Generalized Spectral Kernels
In this paper we propose a family of tractable kernels that is dense in the
family of bounded positive semi-definite functions (i.e. can approximate any
bounded kernel with arbitrary precision). We start by discussing the case of
stationary kernels, and propose a family of spectral kernels that extends
existing approaches such as spectral mixture kernels and sparse spectrum
kernels. Our extension has two primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing
spectral approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the kernels we
introduce allow learning the degree of differentiability of the latent function
in Gaussian process (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that some of the
kernels we propose require fewer parameters than existing spectral kernels for
the same accuracy, thereby leading to faster and more robust inference.
Finally, we generalize our approach and propose a flexible and tractable family
of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any continuous bounded
nonstationary kernel.
