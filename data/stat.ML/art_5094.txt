Demographical Priors for Health Conditions Diagnosis Using Medicare Data
This paper presents an example of how demographical characteristics of
patients influence their susceptibility to certain medical conditions. In this
paper, we investigate the association of health conditions to age of patients
in a heterogeneous population. We show that besides the symptoms a patients is
having, the age has the potential of aiding the diagnostic process in
hospitals. Working with Electronic Health Records (EHR), we show that medical
conditions group into clusters that share distinctive population age densities.
We use Electronic Health Records from Brazil for a period of 15 months from
March of 2013 to July of 2014. The number of patients in the data is 1.7
million patients and the number of records is 47 million records. The findings
has the potential of helping in a setting where an automated system undergoes
the task of predicting the condition of a patient given their symptoms and
demographical information.
