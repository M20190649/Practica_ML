Random Forest Missing Data Algorithms
Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for
dealing with missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to
handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and
nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings.
Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms but relatively
little guidance about their efficacy, which motivated us to study their
performance. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, performance of
various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms.
Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation
utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class
representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called
missForest. Performance of algorithms was assessed by ability to impute data
accurately. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with
performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under
moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing
not at random.
