Whitening-Free Least-Squares Non-Gaussian Component Analysis
Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension
reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian "signals" from
high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as
a generalization of projection pursuit (PP) and independent component analysis
(ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed,
seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA
approach called least-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a
solution analytically through least-squares estimation of log-density gradients
and eigendecomposition. However, since pre-whitening of data is involved in
LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is
ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In
this paper, we propose a whitening-free LSNGCA method and experimentally
demonstrate its superiority.
