Orthogonal Machine Learning for Demand Estimation: High Dimensional
  Causal Inference in Dynamic Panels
There has been growing interest in how economists can import machine learning
tools designed for prediction to accelerate and automate the model selection
process, while still retaining desirable inference properties for causal
parameters. Focusing on partially linear models, we extend the Double ML
framework to allow for (1) a number of treatments that may grow with the sample
size and (2) the analysis of panel data under sequentially exogenous errors.
Our low-dimensional treatment (LD) regime directly extends the work in
[Chernozhukov et al., 2016], by showing that the coefficients from a second
stage, ordinary least squares estimator attain root-n convergence and desired
coverage even if the dimensionality of treatment is allowed to grow. In a
high-dimensional sparse (HDS) regime, we show that second stage LASSO and
debiased LASSO have asymptotic properties equivalent to oracle estimators with
no upstream error. We argue that these advances make Double ML methods a
desirable alternative for practitioners estimating short-term demand
elasticities in non-contractual settings.
