Additive Covariance Kernels for High-Dimensional Gaussian Process
  Modeling
Gaussian process models -also called Kriging models- are often used as
mathematical approximations of expensive experiments. However, the number of
observation required for building an emulator becomes unrealistic when using
classical covariance kernels when the dimension of input increases. In oder to
get round the curse of dimensionality, a popular approach is to consider
simplified models such as additive models. The ambition of the present work is
to give an insight into covariance kernels that are well suited for building
additive Kriging models and to describe some properties of the resulting
models.
