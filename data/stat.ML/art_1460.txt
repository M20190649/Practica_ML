Estimating the Operating Characteristics of Ensemble Methods
In this paper we present a technique for using the bootstrap to estimate the
operating characteristics and their variability for certain types of ensemble
methods. Bootstrapping a model can require a huge amount of work if the
training data set is large. Fortunately in many cases the technique lets us
determine the effect of infinite resampling without actually refitting a single
model. We apply the technique to the study of meta-parameter selection for
random forests. We demonstrate that alternatives to bootstrap aggregation and
to considering \sqrt{d} features to split each node, where d is the number of
features, can produce improvements in predictive accuracy.
