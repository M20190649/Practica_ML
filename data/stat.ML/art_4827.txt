Multi-View Kernel Consensus For Data Analysis
The input data features set for many data driven tasks is high-dimensional
while the intrinsic dimension of the data is low. Data analysis methods aim to
uncover the underlying low dimensional structure imposed by the low dimensional
hidden parameters by utilizing distance metrics that consider the set of
attributes as a single monolithic set. However, the transformation of the low
dimensional phenomena into the measured high dimensional observations might
distort the distance metric, This distortion can effect the desired estimated
low dimensional geometric structure. In this paper, we suggest to utilize the
redundancy in the attribute domain by partitioning the attributes into multiple
subsets we call views. The proposed methods utilize the agreement also called
consensus between different views to extract valuable geometric information
that unifies multiple views about the intrinsic relationships among several
different observations. This unification enhances the information that a single
view or a simple concatenations of views provides.
