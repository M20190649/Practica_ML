Simulation and Calibration of a Fully Bayesian Marked Multidimensional
  Hawkes Process with Dissimilar Decays
We propose a simulation method for multidimensional Hawkes processes based on
superposition theory of point processes. This formulation allows us to design
efficient simulations for Hawkes processes with differing exponentially
decaying intensities. We demonstrate that inter-arrival times can be decomposed
into simpler auxiliary variables that can be sampled directly, giving exact
simulation with no approximation. We establish that the auxiliary variables
provides information on the parent process for each event time. The algorithm
correctness is shown by verifying the simulated intensities with their
theoretical moments. A modular inference procedure consisting of Gibbs samplers
through the auxiliary variable augmentation and adaptive rejection sampling is
presented. Finally, we compare our proposed simulation method against existing
methods, and find significant improvement in terms of algorithm speed. Our
inference algorithm is used to discover the strengths of mutually excitations
in real dark networks.
