Towards Faster Rates and Oracle Property for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation
We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex
penalties. We first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster
statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear
norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on
the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys
oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides
attaining a faster rate. As far as we know, this is the first work that
establishes the theory of low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties,
confirming the advantages of nonconvex penalties for matrix completion.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our
theory.
