Nonparametric Quantile-Based Causal Discovery
Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data is a challenging
problem, especially in the bivariate case. Contemporary methods often assume an
independence between the cause and the generating mechanism of the effect given
the cause. From this postulate, they derive asymmetries to uncover causal
relationships. Leveraging the same postulate, in this work, we propose a novel
approach based on the link between Kolmogorov complexity and quantile scoring.
We use a nonparametric conditional quantile estimator based on copulas to
implement our procedure, thus avoiding restrictive assumptions about the joint
distribution between cause and effect. In an extensive study on real and
synthetic data, we show that quantile copula causal discovery (QCCD) compares
favorably to state-of-the-art methods.
