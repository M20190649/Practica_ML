Integrating Prior Knowledge Into Prognostic Biomarker Discovery based on
  Network Structure
Background: Predictive, stable and interpretable gene signatures are
generally seen as an important step towards a better personalized medicine.
During the last decade various methods have been proposed for that purpose.
However, one important obstacle for making gene signatures a standard tool in
clinics is the typical low reproducibility of these signatures combined with
the difficulty to achieve a clear biological interpretation. For that purpose
in the last years there has been a growing interest in approaches that try to
integrate information from molecular interaction networks. Results: We propose
a novel algorithm, called FrSVM, which integrates protein-protein interaction
network information into gene selection for prognostic biomarker discovery. Our
method is a simple filter based approach, which focuses on central genes with
large differences in their expression. Compared to several other competing
methods our algorithm reveals a significantly better prediction performance and
higher signature stability. More- over, obtained gene lists are highly enriched
with known disease genes and drug targets. We extendd our approach further by
integrating information on candidate disease genes and targets of disease
associated Transcript Factors (TFs).
