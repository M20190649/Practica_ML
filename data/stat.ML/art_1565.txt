Variational Inference for Gaussian Process with Panel Count Data
We present the first framework for Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson
processes when the temporal data appear in the form of panel counts. Panel
count data frequently arise when experimental subjects are observed only at
discrete time points and only the numbers of occurrences of the events between
subsequent observation times are available. The exact occurrence timestamps of
the events are unknown. The method of conducting the efficient variational
inference is presented, based on the assumption of a Gaussian-process-modulated
intensity function. We derive a tractable lower bound to alleviate the problems
of the intractable evidence lower bound inherent in the variational inference
framework. Our algorithm outperforms classical methods on both synthetic and
three real panel count sets.
