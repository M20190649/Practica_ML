Efficient Bayesian Nonparametric Modelling of Structured Point Processes
This paper presents a Bayesian generative model for dependent Cox point
processes, alongside an efficient inference scheme which scales as if the point
processes were modelled independently. We can handle missing data naturally,
infer latent structure, and cope with large numbers of observed processes. A
further novel contribution enables the model to work effectively in higher
dimensional spaces. Using this method, we achieve vastly improved predictive
performance on both 2D and 1D real data, validating our structured approach.
