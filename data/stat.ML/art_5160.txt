Permuted and Augmented Stick-Breaking Bayesian Multinomial Regression
To model categorical response variables given their covariates, we propose a
permuted and augmented stick-breaking (paSB) construction that one-to-one maps
the observed categories to randomly permuted latent sticks. This new
construction transforms multinomial regression into regression analysis of
stick-specific binary random variables that are mutually independent given
their covariate-dependent stick success probabilities, which are parameterized
by the regression coefficients of their corresponding categories. The paSB
construction allows transforming an arbitrary cross-entropy-loss binary
classifier into a Bayesian multinomial one. Specifically, we parameterize the
negative logarithms of the stick failure probabilities with a family of
covariate-dependent softplus functions to construct nonparametric Bayesian
multinomial softplus regression, and transform Bayesian support vector machine
(SVM) into Bayesian multinomial SVM. These Bayesian multinomial regression
models are not only capable of providing probability estimates, quantifying
uncertainty, increasing robustness, and producing nonlinear classification
decision boundaries, but also amenable to posterior simulation. Example results
demonstrate their attractive properties and performance.
