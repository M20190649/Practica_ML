Mixtures of conditional Gaussian scale mixtures applied to multiscale
  image representations
We present a probabilistic model for natural images which is based on
Gaussian scale mixtures and a simple multiscale representation. In contrast to
the dominant approach to modeling whole images focusing on Markov random
fields, we formulate our model in terms of a directed graphical model. We show
that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations
when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion based model. More
importantly, the directed model enables us to perform a principled evaluation.
While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our
model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with
respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average
log-likelihood.
