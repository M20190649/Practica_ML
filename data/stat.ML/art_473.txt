Variational Reformulation of Bayesian Inverse Problems
The classical approach to inverse problems is based on the optimization of a
misfit function. Despite its computational appeal, such an approach suffers
from many shortcomings, e.g., non-uniqueness of solutions, modeling prior
knowledge, etc. The Bayesian formalism to inverse problems avoids most of the
difficulties encountered by the optimization approach, albeit at an increased
computational cost. In this work, we use information theoretic arguments to
cast the Bayesian inference problem in terms of an optimization problem. The
resulting scheme combines the theoretical soundness of fully Bayesian inference
with the computational efficiency of a simple optimization.
