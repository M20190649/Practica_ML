Network cross-validation by edge sampling
While many statistical models and methods are now available for network
analysis, resampling network data remains a challenging problem.
Cross-validation is a useful general tool for model selection and parameter
tuning, but is not directly applicable to networks since splitting network
nodes into groups requires deleting edges and destroys some of the network
structure. Here we propose a new network resampling strategy based on splitting
node pairs rather than nodes applicable to cross-validation for a wide range of
network model selection tasks. We provide a theoretical justification for our
method in a general setting and examples of how our method can be used in
specific network model selection and parameter tuning tasks. Numerical results
on simulated networks and on a citation network of statisticians show that this
cross-validation approach works well for model selection.
