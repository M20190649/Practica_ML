Block modelling in dynamic networks with non-homogeneous Poisson
  processes and exact ICL
We develop a model in which interactions between nodes of a dynamic network
are counted by non homogeneous Poisson processes. In a block modelling
perspective, nodes belong to hidden clusters (whose number is unknown) and the
intensity functions of the counting processes only depend on the clusters of
nodes. In order to make inference tractable we move to discrete time by
partitioning the entire time horizon in which interactions are observed in
fixed-length time sub-intervals. First, we derive an exact integrated
classification likelihood criterion and maximize it relying on a greedy search
approach. This allows to estimate the memberships to clusters and the number of
clusters simultaneously. Then a maximum-likelihood estimator is developed to
estimate non parametrically the integrated intensities. We discuss the
over-fitting problems of the model and propose a regularized version solving
these issues. Experiments on real and simulated data are carried out in order
to assess the proposed methodology.
