A nonparametric HMM for genetic imputation and coalescent inference
Genetic sequence data are well described by hidden Markov models (HMMs) in
which latent states correspond to clusters of similar mutation patterns. Theory
from statistical genetics suggests that these HMMs are nonhomogeneous (their
transition probabilities vary along the chromosome) and have large support for
self transitions. We develop a new nonparametric model of genetic sequence
data, based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process, which supports these self
transitions and nonhomogeneity. Our model provides a parameterization of the
genetic process that is more parsimonious than other more general nonparametric
models which have previously been applied to population genetics. We provide
truncation-free MCMC inference for our model using a new auxiliary sampling
scheme for Bayesian nonparametric HMMs. In a series of experiments on male X
chromosome data from the Thousand Genomes Project and also on data simulated
from a population bottleneck we show the benefits of our model over the popular
finite model fastPHASE, which can itself be seen as a parametric truncation of
our model. We find that the number of HMM states found by our model is
correlated with the time to the most recent common ancestor in population
bottlenecks. This work demonstrates the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametrics
applied to large and complex genetic data.
