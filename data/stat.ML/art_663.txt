A Variational Bayesian State-Space Approach to Online Passive-Aggressive
  Regression
Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is a class of online margin-based
algorithms suitable for a wide range of real-time prediction tasks, including
classification and regression. PA algorithms are formulated in terms of
deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined
hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and
makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In
this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that
overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space
interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational
inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also
offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various
real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than
a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model.
