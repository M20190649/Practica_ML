Tensor Valued Common and Individual Feature Extraction:
  Multi-dimensional Perspective
A novel method for common and individual feature analysis from exceedingly
large-scale data is proposed, in order to ensure the tractability of both the
computation and storage and thus mitigate the curse of dimensionality, a major
bottleneck in modern data science. This is achieved by making use of the
inherent redundancy in so-called multi-block data structures, which represent
multiple observations of the same phenomenon taken at different times, angles
or recording conditions. Upon providing an intrinsic link between the
properties of the outer vector product and extracted features in tensor
decompositions (TDs), the proposed common and individual information extraction
from multi-block data is performed through imposing physical meaning to
otherwise unconstrained factorisation approaches. This is shown to dramatically
reduce the dimensionality of search spaces for subsequent classification
procedures and to yield greatly enhanced accuracy. Simulations on a multi-class
classification task of large-scale extraction of individual features from a
collection of partially related real-world images demonstrate the advantages of
the "blessing of dimensionality" associated with TDs.
