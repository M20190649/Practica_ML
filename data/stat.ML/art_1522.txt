Safe Triplet Screening for Distance Metric Learning
We study safe screening for metric learning. Distance metric learning can
optimize a metric over a set of triplets, each one of which is defined by a
pair of same class instances and an instance in a different class. However, the
number of possible triplets is quite huge even for a small dataset. Our safe
triplet screening identifies triplets which can be safely removed from the
optimization problem without losing the optimality. Compared with existing safe
screening studies, triplet screening is particularly significant because of (1)
the huge number of possible triplets, and (2) the semi-definite constraint in
the optimization. We derive several variants of screening rules, and analyze
their relationships. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of safe triplet screening.
