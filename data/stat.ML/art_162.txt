A General Theory of Concave Regularization for High Dimensional Sparse
  Estimation Problems
Concave regularization methods provide natural procedures for sparse
recovery. However, they are difficult to analyze in the high dimensional
setting. Only recently a few sparse recovery results have been established for
some specific local solutions obtained via specialized numerical procedures.
Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether
they are identical or their relationship to the global minimizer of the
underlying nonconvex formulation is unknown. The current paper fills this
conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under
appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads
to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the
global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be
obtained via different numerical procedures. Under this unified framework, we
present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The
unified view of this work leads to a more satisfactory treatment of concave
high dimensional sparse estimation procedures, and serves as guideline for
developing further numerical procedures for concave regularization.
