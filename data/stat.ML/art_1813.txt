Bayesian Optimization for Adaptive MCMC
This paper proposes a new randomized strategy for adaptive MCMC using
Bayesian optimization. This approach applies to non-differentiable objective
functions and trades off exploration and exploitation to reduce the number of
potentially costly objective function evaluations. We demonstrate the strategy
in the complex setting of sampling from constrained, discrete and densely
connected probabilistic graphical models where, for each variation of the
problem, one needs to adjust the parameters of the proposal mechanism
automatically to ensure efficient mixing of the Markov chains.
