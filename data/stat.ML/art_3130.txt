Convergence and rate of convergence of some greedy algorithms in convex
  optimization
The paper gives a systematic study of the approximate versions of three
greedy-type algorithms that are widely used in convex optimization. By
approximate version we mean the one where some of evaluations are made with an
error. Importance of such versions of greedy-type algorithms in convex
optimization and in approximation theory was emphasized in previous literature.
