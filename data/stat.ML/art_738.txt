Classification of weak multi-view signals by sharing factors in a
  mixture of Bayesian group factor analyzers
We propose a novel classification model for weak signal data, building upon a
recent model for Bayesian multi-view learning, Group Factor Analysis (GFA).
Instead of assuming all data to come from a single GFA model, we allow latent
clusters, each having a different GFA model and producing a different class
distribution. We show that sharing information across the clusters, by sharing
factors, increases the classification accuracy considerably; the shared factors
essentially form a flexible noise model that explains away the part of data not
related to classification. Motivation for the setting comes from single-trial
functional brain imaging data, having a very low signal-to-noise ratio and a
natural multi-view setting, with the different sensors, measurement modalities
(EEG, MEG, fMRI) and possible auxiliary information as views. We demonstrate
our model on a MEG dataset.
