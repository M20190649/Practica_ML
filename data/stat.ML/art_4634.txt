Nonparametric Bayesian Negative Binomial Factor Analysis
A common approach to analyze a covariate-sample count matrix, an element of
which represents how many times a covariate appears in a sample, is to
factorize it under the Poisson likelihood. We show its limitation in capturing
the tendency for a covariate present in a sample to both repeat itself and
excite related ones. To address this limitation, we construct negative binomial
factor analysis (NBFA) to factorize the matrix under the negative binomial
likelihood, and relate it to a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution based
mixed-membership model. To support countably infinite factors, we propose the
hierarchical gamma-negative binomial process. By exploiting newly proved
connections between discrete distributions, we construct two blocked and a
collapsed Gibbs sampler that all adaptively truncate their number of factors,
and demonstrate that the blocked Gibbs sampler developed under a compound
Poisson representation converges fast and has low computational complexity.
Example results show that NBFA has a distinct mechanism in adjusting its number
of inferred factors according to the sample lengths, and provides clear
advantages in parsimonious representation, predictive power, and computational
complexity over previously proposed discrete latent variable models, which
either completely ignore burstiness, or model only the burstiness of the
covariates but not that of the factors.
