Expectation propagation for continuous time stochastic processes
We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the posterior measure over
the trajec- tories of a diffusion process from discrete time observations and
continuous time constraints. We cast the problem in a Bayesian framework and
derive approximations to the posterior distributions of single time marginals
using variational approximate inference. We then show how the approximation can
be extended to a wide class of discrete-state Markov jump pro- cesses by making
use of the chemical Langevin equation. Our empirical results show that the
proposed method is computationally efficient and provides good approximations
for these classes of inverse problems.
