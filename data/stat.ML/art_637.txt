Completely random measures for modelling block-structured networks
Many statistical methods for network data parameterize the edge-probability
by attributing latent traits to the vertices such as block structure and assume
exchangeability in the sense of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem.
Empirical studies of networks indicate that many real-world networks have a
power-law distribution of the vertices which in turn implies the number of
edges scale slower than quadratically in the number of vertices. These
assumptions are fundamentally irreconcilable as the Aldous-Hoover theorem
implies quadratic scaling of the number of edges. Recently Caron and Fox (2014)
proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability due to Kallenberg
(2009) and obtained a network model which admits power-law behaviour while
retaining desirable statistical properties, however this model does not capture
latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the
use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg's notion of
exchangeability and thereby obtain a model which admits the inference of
block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the
likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not
significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to
block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets.
