A Ternary Non-Commutative Latent Factor Model for Scalable Three-Way
  Real Tensor Completion
Motivated by large-scale Collaborative-Filtering applications, we present a
Non-Commuting Latent Factor (NCLF) tensor-completion approach for modeling
three-way arrays, which is diagonal like the standard PARAFAC, but wherein
different terms distinguish different kinds of three-way relations of
co-clusters, as determined by permutations of latent factors. The first key
component of the algebraic representation is the usage of two non-commutative
real trilinear operations as the building blocks of the approximation. These
operations are the standard three dimensional triple-product and a trilinear
product on a two-dimensional real vector space, which is a representation of
the real Clifford Algebra Cl(1,1) (a certain Majorana spinor). Both operations
are purely ternary in that they cannot be decomposed into two group-operations
on the relevant spaces. The second key component of the method is combining
these operations using permutation-symmetry preserving linear combinations. We
apply the model to the MovieLens and Fannie Mae datasets, and find that it
outperforms the PARAFAC model. We propose some future directions, such as
unsupervised-learning.
