Estimation of matrix trace using machine learning
We present a new trace estimator of the matrix whose explicit form is not
given but its matrix multiplication to a vector is available. The form of the
estimator is similar to the Hutchison stochastic trace estimator, but instead
of the random noise vectors in Hutchison estimator, we use small number of
probing vectors determined by machine learning. Evaluation of the quality of
estimates and bias correction are discussed. An unbiased estimator is proposed
for the calculation of the expectation value of a function of traces. In the
numerical experiments with random matrices, it is shown that the precision of
trace estimates with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ probing vectors determined by the
machine learning is similar to that with $\mathcal{O}(10000)$ random noise
vectors.
