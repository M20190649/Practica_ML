Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable: A Bayesian Model Selection Approach
Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosted trees, are renowned for
their high prediction performance. However, their interpretability is
critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a
method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model.
Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model
selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the
simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To
this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the
simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical
experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were
reasonably approximated as interpretable.
