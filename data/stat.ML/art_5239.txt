Understanding food inflation in India: A Machine Learning approach
Over the past decade, the stellar growth of Indian economy has been
challenged by persistently high levels of inflation, particularly in food
prices. The primary reason behind this stubborn food inflation is mismatch in
supply-demand, as domestic agricultural production has failed to keep up with
rising demand owing to a number of proximate factors. The relative significance
of these factors in determining the change in food prices have been analysed
using gradient boosted regression trees (BRT), a machine learning technique.
The results from BRT indicates all predictor variables to be fairly significant
in explaining the change in food prices, with MSP and farm wages being
relatively more important than others. International food prices were found to
have limited relevance in explaining the variation in domestic food prices. The
challenge of ensuring food and nutritional security for growing Indian
population with rising incomes needs to be addressed through resolute policy
reforms.
