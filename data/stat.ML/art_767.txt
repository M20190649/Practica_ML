What is the distribution of the number of unique original items in a
  bootstrap sample?
Sampling with replacement occurs in many settings in machine learning,
notably in the bagging ensemble technique and the .632+ validation scheme. The
number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample can have an important
role in the behaviour of prediction models learned on it. Indeed, there are
uncontrived examples where duplicate items have no effect. The purpose of this
report is to present the distribution of the number of unique original items in
a bootstrap sample clearly and concisely, with a view to enabling other machine
learning researchers to understand and control this quantity in existing and
future resampling techniques. We describe the key characteristics of this
distribution along with the generalisation for the case where items come from
distinct categories, as in classification. In both cases we discuss the normal
limit, and conduct an empirical investigation to derive a heuristic for when a
normal approximation is permissible.
