Causal inference via algebraic geometry: feasibility tests for
  functional causal structures with two binary observed variables
We provide a scheme for inferring causal relations from uncontrolled
statistical data based on tools from computational algebraic geometry, in
particular, the computation of Groebner bases. We focus on causal structures
containing just two observed variables, each of which is binary. We consider
the consequences of imposing different restrictions on the number and
cardinality of latent variables and of assuming different functional
dependences of the observed variables on the latent ones (in particular, the
noise need not be additive). We provide an inductive scheme for classifying
functional causal structures into distinct observational equivalence classes.
For each observational equivalence class, we provide a procedure for deriving
constraints on the joint distribution that are necessary and sufficient
conditions for it to arise from a model in that class. We also demonstrate how
this sort of approach provides a means of determining which causal parameters
are identifiable and how to solve for these. Prospects for expanding the scope
of our scheme, in particular to the problem of quantum causal inference, are
also discussed.
