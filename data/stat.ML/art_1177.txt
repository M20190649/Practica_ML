Energy Prediction using Spatiotemporal Pattern Networks
This paper presents a novel data-driven technique based on the spatiotemporal
pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical
systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to
capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise
causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal
dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy
prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For
validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving
wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind
Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other,
residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the
Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features.
In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the
STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation
performance.
