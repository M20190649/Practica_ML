Nonlinear Channel Estimation for OFDM System by Complex LS-SVM under
  High Mobility Conditions
A nonlinear channel estimator using complex Least Square Support Vector
Machines (LS-SVM) is proposed for pilot-aided OFDM system and applied to Long
Term Evolution (LTE) downlink under high mobility conditions. The estimation
algorithm makes use of the reference signals to estimate the total frequency
response of the highly selective multipath channel in the presence of
non-Gaussian impulse noise interfering with pilot signals. Thus, the algorithm
maps trained data into a high dimensional feature space and uses the structural
risk minimization (SRM) principle to carry out the regression estimation for
the frequency response function of the highly selective channel. The
simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method which has good
performance and high precision to track the variations of the fading channels
compared to the conventional LS method and it is robust at high speed mobility.
