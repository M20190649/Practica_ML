Simultaneous Sparse Dictionary Learning and Pruning
Dictionary learning is a cutting-edge area in imaging processing, that has
recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The
idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a
learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis.
Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both
precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary
learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel
regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation
(GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can
simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary
size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the
non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are
presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with
other state-of-the-art approaches.
