Regularizing Solutions to the MEG Inverse Problem Using Space-Time
  Separable Covariance Functions
In magnetoencephalography (MEG) the conventional approach to source
reconstruction is to solve the underdetermined inverse problem independently
over time and space. Here we present how the conventional approach can be
extended by regularizing the solution in space and time by a Gaussian process
(Gaussian random field) model. Assuming a separable covariance function in
space and time, the computational complexity of the proposed model becomes
(without any further assumptions or restrictions) $\mathcal{O}(t^3 + n^3 +
m^2n)$, where $t$ is the number of time steps, $m$ is the number of sources,
and $n$ is the number of sensors. We apply the method to both simulated and
empirical data, and demonstrate the efficiency and generality of our Bayesian
source reconstruction approach which subsumes various classical approaches in
the literature.
