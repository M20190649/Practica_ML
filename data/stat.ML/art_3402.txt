A Topological Approach to Spectral Clustering
We propose a clustering algorithm which, for input, takes data assumed to be
sampled from a uniform distribution supported on a metric space $X$, and
outputs a clustering of the data based on a topological estimate of the
connected components of $X$. The algorithm works by choosing a weighted graph
on the samples from a natural one-parameter family of graphs using an error
based on the heat operator on the graphs. The estimated connected components of
$X$ are identified as the support of the eigenfunctions of the heat operator
with eigenvalue $1$, which allows the algorithm to work without requiring the
number of expected clusters as input.
