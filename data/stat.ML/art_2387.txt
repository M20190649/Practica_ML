Parameter Priors for Directed Acyclic Graphical Models and the
  Characterization of Several Probability Distributions
We show that the only parameter prior for complete Gaussian DAG models that
satisfies global parameter independence, complete model equivalence, and some
weak regularity assumptions, is the normal-Wishart distribution. Our analysis
is based on the following new characterization of the Wishart distribution: let
W be an n x n, n >= 3, positive-definite symmetric matrix of random variables
and f(W) be a pdf of W. Then, f(W) is a Wishart distribution if and only if
W_{11}-W_{12}W_{22}^{-1}W_{12}' is independent of {W_{12}, W_{22}} for every
block partitioning W_{11}, W_{12}, W_{12}', W_{22} of W. Similar
characterizations of the normal and normal-Wishart distributions are provided
as well. We also show how to construct a prior for every DAG model over X from
the prior of a single regression model.
