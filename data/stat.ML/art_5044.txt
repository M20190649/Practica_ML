Max-Norm Optimization for Robust Matrix Recovery
This paper studies the matrix completion problem under arbitrary sampling
schemes. We propose a new estimator incorporating both max-norm and
nuclear-norm regularization, based on which we can conduct efficient low-rank
matrix recovery using a random subset of entries observed with additive noise
under general non-uniform and unknown sampling distributions. This method
significantly relaxes the uniform sampling assumption imposed for the widely
used nuclear-norm penalized approach, and makes low-rank matrix recovery
feasible in more practical settings. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed
estimator achieves fast rates of convergence under different settings.
Computationally, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers
algorithm to efficiently compute the estimator, which bridges a gap between
theory and practice of machine learning methods with max-norm regularization.
Further, we provide thorough numerical studies to evaluate the proposed method
using both simulated and real datasets.
