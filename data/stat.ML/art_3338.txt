Prediction and Quantification of Individual Athletic Performance
We provide scientific foundations for athletic performance prediction on an
individual level, exposing the phenomenology of individual athletic running
performance in the form of a low-rank model dominated by an individual power
law. We present, evaluate, and compare a selection of methods for prediction of
individual running performance, including our own, \emph{local matrix
completion} (LMC), which we show to perform best. We also show that many
documented phenomena in quantitative sports science, such as the form of
scoring tables, the success of existing prediction methods including Riegel's
formula, the Purdy points scheme, the power law for world records performances
and the broken power law for world record speeds may be explained on the basis
of our findings in a unified way.
