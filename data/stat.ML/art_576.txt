Partition MCMC for inference on acyclic digraphs
Acyclic digraphs are the underlying representation of Bayesian networks, a
widely used class of probabilistic graphical models. Learning the underlying
graph from data is a way of gaining insights about the structural properties of
a domain. Structure learning forms one of the inference challenges of
statistical graphical models.
  MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior
distribution given the data are probably the only viable option for Bayesian
model averaging. Score modularity and restrictions on the number of parents of
each node allow the graphs to be grouped into larger collections, which can be
scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of
algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts
on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge
reversal moves.
  Here we propose a novel algorithm, which employs the underlying combinatorial
structure of DAGs to define a new grouping. As a result convergence is improved
compared to structure MCMC, while still retaining the property of producing an
unbiased sample. Finally the method can be combined with edge reversal moves to
improve the sampler further.
