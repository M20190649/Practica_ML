A Permutation Approach for Selecting the Penalty Parameter in Penalized
  Model Selection
We describe a simple, efficient, permutation based procedure for selecting
the penalty parameter in the LASSO. The procedure, which is intended for
applications where variable selection is the primary focus, can be applied in a
variety of structural settings, including generalized linear models. We briefly
discuss connections between permutation selection and existing theory for the
LASSO. In addition, we present a simulation study and an analysis of three real
data sets in which permutation selection is compared with cross-validation
(CV), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and a selection method based on
recently developed testing procedures for the LASSO.
