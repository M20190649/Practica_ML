A comparison of bandwidth selectors for mean shift clustering
We explore the performance of several automatic bandwidth selectors,
originally designed for density gradient estimation, as data-based procedures
for nonparametric, modal clustering. The key tool to obtain a clustering from
density gradient estimators is the mean shift algorithm, which allows to obtain
a partition not only of the data sample, but also of the whole space. The
results of our simulation study suggest that most of the methods considered
here, like cross validation and plug in bandwidth selectors, are useful for
cluster analysis via the mean shift algorithm.
