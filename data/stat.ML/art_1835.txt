A New Algorithm for Exploratory Projection Pursuit
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for exploratory projection pursuit.
The basis of the algorithm is the insight that previous approaches used fairly
narrow definitions of interestingness / non interestingness. We argue that
allowing these definitions to depend on the problem / data at hand is a more
natural approach in an exploratory technique. This also allows our technique
much greater applicability than the approaches extant in the literature.
Complementing this insight, we propose a class of projection indices based on
the spatial distribution function that can make use of such information.
  Finally, with the help of real datasets, we demonstrate how a range of
multivariate exploratory tasks can be addressed with our algorithm. The
examples further demonstrate that the proposed indices are quite capable of
focussing on the interesting structure in the data, even when this structure is
otherwise hard to detect or arises from very subtle patterns.
