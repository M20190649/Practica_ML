Tree Space Prototypes: Another Look at Making Tree Ensembles
  Interpretable
Ensembles of decision trees have good prediction accuracy but suffer from a
lack of interpretability. We propose a new approach for interpreting tree
ensembles by finding prototypes in tree space, utilizing the naturally-learned
similarity measure from the tree ensemble. Demonstrating the method on random
forests, we show that the method benefits from unique aspects of tree ensembles
by leveraging tree structure to sequentially find prototypes. The method
provides good prediction accuracy when found prototypes are used in
nearest-prototype classifiers, while using fewer prototypes than competitor
methods. We are investigating the sensitivity of the method to different
prototype-finding procedures and demonstrating it on higher-dimensional data.
