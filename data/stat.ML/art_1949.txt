Corrected Kriging update formulae for batch-sequential data assimilation
Recently, a lot of effort has been paid to the efficient computation of
Kriging predictors when observations are assimilated sequentially. In
particular, Kriging update formulae enabling significant computational savings
were derived in Barnes and Watson (1992), Gao et al. (1996), and Emery (2009).
Taking advantage of the previous Kriging mean and variance calculations helps
avoiding a costly $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ matrix inversion when adding one
observation to the $n$ already available ones. In addition to traditional
update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) also
proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when $r > 1$ new
observations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the Kriging variance and
covariance formulae given without proof in Emery (2009) for the
batch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper we fix this issue and
establish corrected expressions for updated Kriging variances and covariances
when assimilating several observations in parallel.
