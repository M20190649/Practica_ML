A Birth and Death Process for Bayesian Network Structure Inference
Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models that are useful for representing
high-dimensional probability distributions. There has been a great deal of
interest in recent years in the NP-hard problem of learning the structure of a
BN from observed data. Typically, one assigns a score to various structures and
the search becomes an optimization problem that can be approached with either
deterministic or stochastic methods. In this paper, we walk through the space
of graphs by modeling the appearance and disappearance of edges as a birth and
death process and compare our novel approach to the popular Metropolis-Hastings
search strategy. We give empirical evidence that the birth and death process
has superior mixing properties.
