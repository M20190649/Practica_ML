YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge Approach and Applications
This paper introduces the YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge hosted as
a Kaggle competition and also describes my approach to experimenting with
various models. For each of my experiments, I provide the score result as well
as possible improvements to be made. Towards the end of the paper, I discuss
the various ensemble learning techniques that I applied on the dataset which
significantly boosted my overall competition score. At last, I discuss the
exciting future of video understanding research and also the many applications
that such research could significantly improve.
