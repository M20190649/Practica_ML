A Mutually-Dependent Hadamard Kernel for Modelling Latent Variable
  Couplings
We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across
multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along
inputs and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A
latent correlation Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary
latent components into multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix.
Probit classification and support for multiple observation sets are derived by
Variational Bayesian inference. Results on several datasets indicate that the
LCGP model can recover the correlations between latent signals while
simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. We highlight the latent
covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent brain processes and
their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model.
