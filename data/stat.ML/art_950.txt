Predicting readmission risk from doctors' notes
We develop a model using deep learning techniques and natural language
processing on unstructured text from medical records to predict hospital-wide
$30$-day unplanned readmission, with c-statistic $.70$. Our model is
constructed to allow physicians to interpret the significant features for
prediction.
