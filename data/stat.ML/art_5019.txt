Predicting Shot Making in Basketball Learnt from Adversarial Multiagent
  Trajectories
In this paper, we predict the likelihood of a player making a shot in
basketball from multiagent trajectories. Previous approaches to similar
problems center on hand-crafting features to capture domain specific knowledge.
Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is
prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we
present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially
represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature
of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN.
Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we "fade" the
player trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional
FFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained
CNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a
combined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%.
