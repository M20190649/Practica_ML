Learning task structure via sparsity grouped multitask learning
Sparse mapping has been a key methodology in many high-dimensional scientific
problems. When multiple tasks share the set of relevant features, learning them
jointly in a group drastically improves the quality of relevant feature
selection. However, in practice this technique is used limitedly since such
grouping information is usually hidden. In this paper, our goal is to recover
the group structure on the sparsity patterns and leverage that information in
the sparse learning. Toward this, we formulate a joint optimization problem in
the task parameter and the group membership, by constructing an appropriate
regularizer to encourage sparse learning as well as correct recovery of task
groups. We further demonstrate that our proposed method recovers groups and the
sparsity patterns in the task parameters accurately by extensive experiments.
