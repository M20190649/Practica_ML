On the Generalization of the C-Bound to Structured Output Ensemble
  Methods
This paper generalizes an important result from the PAC-Bayesian literature
for binary classification to the case of ensemble methods for structured
outputs. We prove a generic version of the \Cbound, an upper bound over the
risk of models expressed as a weighted majority vote that is based on the first
and second statistical moments of the vote's margin. This bound may
advantageously $(i)$ be applied on more complex outputs such as multiclass
labels and multilabel, and $(ii)$ allow to consider margin relaxations. These
results open the way to develop new ensemble methods for structured output
prediction with PAC-Bayesian guarantees.
