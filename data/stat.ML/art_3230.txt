Finding Dantzig selectors with a proximity operator based fixed-point
  algorithm
In this paper, we study a simple iterative method for finding the Dantzig
selector, which was designed for linear regression problems. The method
consists of two main stages. The first stage is to approximate the Dantzig
selector through a fixed-point formulation of solutions to the Dantzig selector
problem. The second stage is to construct a new estimator by regressing data
onto the support of the approximated Dantzig selector. We compare our method to
an alternating direction method, and present the results of numerical
simulations using both the proposed method and the alternating direction method
on synthetic and real data sets. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the
two methods produce results of similar quality, however the proposed method
tends to be significantly faster.
