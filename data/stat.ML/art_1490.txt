Compressive sensing adaptation for polynomial chaos expansions
Basis adaptation in Homogeneous Chaos spaces rely on a suitable rotation of
the underlying Gaussian germ. Several rotations have been proposed in the
literature resulting in adaptations with different convergence properties. In
this paper we present a new adaptation mechanism that builds on compressive
sensing algorithms, resulting in a reduced polynomial chaos approximation with
optimal sparsity. The developed adaptation algorithm consists of a two-step
optimization procedure that computes the optimal coefficients and the input
projection matrix of a low dimensional chaos expansion with respect to an
optimally rotated basis. We demonstrate the attractive features of our
algorithm through several numerical examples including the application on
Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations of turbulent combustion in a HIFiRE
scramjet engine.
