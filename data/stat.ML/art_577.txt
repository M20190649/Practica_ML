Nonparametric Testing for Heterogeneous Correlation
In the presence of weak overall correlation, it may be useful to investigate
if the correlation is significantly and substantially more pronounced over a
subpopulation. Two different testing procedures are compared. Both are based on
the rankings of the values of two variables from a data set with a large number
n of observations. The first maintains its level against Gaussian copulas; the
second adapts to general alternatives in the sense that that the number of
parameters used in the test grows with n. An analysis of wine quality
illustrates how the methods detect heterogeneity of association between
chemical properties of the wine, which are attributable to a mix of different
cultivars.
