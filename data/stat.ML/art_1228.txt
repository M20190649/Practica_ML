A statistical model for aggregating judgments by incorporating peer
  predictions
We propose a probabilistic model to aggregate the answers of respondents
answering multiple-choice questions. The model does not assume that everyone
has access to the same information, and so does not assume that the consensus
answer is correct. Instead, it infers the most probable world state, even if
only a minority vote for it. Each respondent is modeled as receiving a signal
contingent on the actual world state, and as using this signal to both
determine their own answer and predict the answers given by others. By
incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers
latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the
probability of different signals being received in all possible world states,
including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for
aggregation, our model applies to both single and multiple questions, in which
case it estimates each respondent's expertise. The model shows good
performance, compared to a number of other probabilistic models, on data from
seven studies covering different types of expertise.
