Clustering categorical data via ensembling dissimilarity matrices
We present a technique for clustering categorical data by generating many
dissimilarity matrices and averaging over them. We begin by demonstrating our
technique on low dimensional categorical data and comparing it to several other
techniques that have been proposed. Then we give conditions under which our
method should yield good results in general. Our method extends to high
dimensional categorical data of equal lengths by ensembling over many choices
of explanatory variables. In this context we compare our method with two other
methods. Finally, we extend our method to high dimensional categorical data
vectors of unequal length by using alignment techniques to equalize the
lengths. We give examples to show that our method continues to provide good
results, in particular, better in the context of genome sequences than
clusterings suggested by phylogenetic trees.
