BDgraph: An R Package for Bayesian Structure Learning in Graphical
  Models
Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in
multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine
learning. In this paper, we introduce the R package BDgraph which performs
Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models
(decomposable and non-decomposable) with continuous, discrete, and mixed
variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the
Bayesian literature, including that of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Dobra and
Mohammadi (2018). To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks
have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R, and the package has
parallel computing capabilities. In addition, the package contains several
functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate
datasets taken from the literature and used to describe the package
capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods
which have been implemented in the package. The main part of the paper explains
how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package's functionality
in both real and artificial examples.
