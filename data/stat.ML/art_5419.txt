Student-t Process Quadratures for Filtering of Non-Linear Systems with
  Heavy-Tailed Noise
The aim of this article is to design a moment transformation for Student- t
distributed random variables, which is able to account for the error in the
numerically computed mean. We employ Student-t process quadrature, an instance
of Bayesian quadrature, which allows us to treat the integral itself as a
random variable whose variance provides information about the incurred
integration error. Advantage of the Student- t process quadrature over the
traditional Gaussian process quadrature, is that the integral variance depends
also on the function values, allowing for a more robust modelling of the
integration error. The moment transform is applied in nonlinear sigma-point
filtering and evaluated on two numerical examples, where it is shown to
outperform the state-of-the-art moment transforms.
