A Composite Quantile Fourier Neural Network for Multi-Horizon
  Probabilistic Forecasting
A novel quantile Fourier neural network is presented for nonparametric
probabilistic forecasting. Prediction are provided in the form of composite
quantiles using time as the only input to the model. This effectively is a form
of extrapolation based quantile regression applied for forecasting. Empirical
results showcase that for time series data that have clear seasonality and
trend, the model provides high quality probabilistic predictions. This work
introduces a new class of forecasting of using only time as the input versus
using past data such as an autoregressive model. Extrapolation based regression
has not been studied before for probabilistic forecasting.
