Linear Regression with Shuffled Labels
Is it possible to perform linear regression on datasets whose labels are
shuffled with respect to the inputs? We explore this question by proposing
several estimators that recover the weights of a noisy linear model from labels
that are shuffled by an unknown permutation. We show that the analog of the
classical least-squares estimator produces inconsistent estimates in this
setting, and introduce an estimator based on the self-moments of the input
features and labels. We study the regimes in which each estimator excels, and
generalize the estimators to the setting where partial ordering information is
available in the form of experiments replicated independently. The result is a
framework that enables robust inference, as we demonstrate by experiments on
both synthetic and standard datasets, where we are able to recover approximate
weights using only shuffled labels. Our work demonstrates that linear
regression in the absence of complete ordering information is possible and can
be of practical interest, particularly in experiments that characterize
populations of particles, such as flow cytometry.
