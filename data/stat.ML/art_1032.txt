Orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix factorization under the
  stochastic block model
We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix
tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in
complex networks. While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist
and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an
optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained
through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of
the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such
factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a
block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected
components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community
detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree
corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis
show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations,
including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral
clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of
the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs
and the karate club data.
