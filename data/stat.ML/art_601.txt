Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Appendix
We show that a neural network with arbitrary depth and non-linearities, with
dropout applied before every weight layer, is mathematically equivalent to an
approximation to a well known Bayesian model. This interpretation might offer
an explanation to some of dropout's key properties, such as its robustness to
over-fitting. Our interpretation allows us to reason about uncertainty in deep
learning, and allows the introduction of the Bayesian machinery into existing
deep learning frameworks in a principled way.

Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning" by Gal and
