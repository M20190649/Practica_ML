Algebraic-Combinatorial Methods for Low-Rank Matrix Completion with
  Application to Athletic Performance Prediction
This paper presents novel algorithms which exploit the intrinsic algebraic
and combinatorial structure of the matrix completion task for estimating
missing en- tries in the general low rank setting. For positive data, we
achieve results out- performing the state of the art nuclear norm, both in
accuracy and computational efficiency, in simulations and in the task of
predicting athletic performance from partially observed data.
