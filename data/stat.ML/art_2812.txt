Blind and fully constrained unmixing of hyperspectral images
This paper addresses the problem of blind and fully constrained unmixing of
hyperspectral images. Unmixing is performed without the use of any dictionary,
and assumes that the number of constituent materials in the scene and their
spectral signatures are unknown. The estimated abundances satisfy the desired
sum-to-one and nonnegativity constraints. Two models with increasing complexity
are developed to achieve this challenging task, depending on how noise
interacts with hyperspectral data. The first one leads to a convex optimization
problem, and is solved with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.
The second one accounts for signal-dependent noise, and is addressed with a
Reweighted Least Squares algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
