Polish - English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the
  IWSLT 2013
This research explores the effects of various training settings from Polish
to English Statistical Machine Translation system for spoken language. Various
elements of the TED parallel text corpora for the IWSLT 2013 evaluation
campaign were used as the basis for training of language models, and for
development, tuning and testing of the translation system. The BLEU, NIST,
METEOR and TER metrics were used to evaluate the effects of data preparations
on translation results. Our experiments included systems, which use stems and
morphological information on Polish words. We also conducted a deep analysis of
provided Polish data as preparatory work for the automatic data correction and
cleaning phase.
