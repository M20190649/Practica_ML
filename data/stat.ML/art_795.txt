Skill-Based Differences in Spatio-Temporal Team Behavior in Defence of
  The Ancients 2
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played
digital games in the world. In these games, teams of players fight against each
other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat.
Mastering MOBAs requires extensive practice, as is exemplified in the popular
MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2). In this paper, we present three
data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA 2: 1) Zone changes; 2)
Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy
approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA
2. We investigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of
the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players.
Results indicate that spatio-temporal behavior of MOBA teams is related to team
skill, with professional teams having smaller within-team distances and
conducting more zone changes than amateur teams. The temporal distribution of
the within-team distances of professional and high-skilled teams also generally
follows patterns distinct from lower skill ranks.
