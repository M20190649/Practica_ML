Inferring Team Strengths Using a Discrete Markov Random Field
We propose an original model for inferring team strengths using a Markov
Random Field, which can be used to generate historical estimates of the
offensive and defensive strengths of a team over time. This model was designed
to be applied to sports such as soccer or hockey, in which contest outcomes
take value in a limited discrete space. We perform inference using a
combination of Expectation Maximization and Loopy Belief Propagation. The
challenges of working with a non-convex optimization problem and a
high-dimensional parameter space are discussed. The performance of the model is
demonstrated on professional soccer data from the English Premier League.
