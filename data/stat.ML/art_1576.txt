Gaussian Processes indexed on the symmetric group: prediction and
  learning
In the framework of the supervised learning of a real function defined on a
space X , the so called Kriging method stands on a real Gaussian field defined
on X. The Euclidean case is well known and has been widely studied. In this
paper, we explore the less classical case where X is the non commutative finite
group of permutations. In this setting, we propose and study an harmonic
analysis of the covariance operators that enables to consider Gaussian
processes models and forecasting issues. Our theory is motivated by statistical
ranking problems.
