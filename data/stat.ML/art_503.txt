Optimal variable selection in multi-group sparse discriminant analysis
This article considers the problem of multi-group classification in the
setting where the number of variables $p$ is larger than the number of
observations $n$. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that
address this problem, however their variable selection performance is either
unknown or suboptimal to the results known in the two-group case. In this work
we provide sharp conditions for the consistent recovery of relevant variables
in the multi-group case using the discriminant analysis proposal of Gaynanova
et al., 2014. We achieve the rates of convergence that attain the optimal
scaling of the sample size $n$, number of variables $p$ and the sparsity level
$s$. These rates are significantly faster than the best known results in the
multi-group case. Moreover, they coincide with the optimal minimax rates for
the two-group case. We validate our theoretical results with numerical
analysis.
