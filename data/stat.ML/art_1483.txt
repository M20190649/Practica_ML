A Mathematical Programming Approach for Integrated Multiple Linear
  Regression Subset Selection and Validation
Subset selection for multiple linear regression aims to construct a
regression model that minimizes errors by selecting a small number of
explanatory variables. Once a model is built, various statistical tests and
diagnostics are conducted to validate the model and to determine whether
regression assumptions are met. Most traditional approaches require human
decisions at this step, for example, the user adding or removing a variable
until a satisfactory model is obtained. However, this trial-and-error strategy
cannot guarantee that a subset that minimizes the errors while satisfying all
regression assumptions will be found. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated model building procedure for multiple linear regression subset
selection that integrates model building and validation based on mathematical
programming. The proposed model minimizes mean squared errors while ensuring
that the majority of the important regression assumptions are met. When no
subset satisfies all of the considered regression assumptions, our model
provides an alternative subset that satisfies most of these assumptions.
Computational results show that our model yields better solutions (i.e.,
satisfying more regression assumptions) compared to benchmark models while
maintaining similar explanatory power.
