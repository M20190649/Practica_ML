Faster independent component analysis by preconditioning with Hessian
  approximations
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique for unsupervised
exploration of multi-channel data that is widely used in observational
sciences. In its classic form, ICA relies on modeling the data as linear
mixtures of non-Gaussian independent sources. The maximization of the
corresponding likelihood is a challenging problem if it has to be completed
quickly and accurately on large sets of real data. We introduce the
Preconditioned ICA for Real Data (Picard) algorithm, which is a relative L-BFGS
algorithm preconditioned with sparse Hessian approximations. Extensive
numerical comparisons to several algorithms of the same class demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed technique, especially on real data, for
which the ICA model does not necessarily hold.
