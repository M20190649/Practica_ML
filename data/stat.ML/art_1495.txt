A graph-embedded deep feedforward network for disease outcome
  classification and feature selection using gene expression data
Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model
building, because of the small number of samples $(n)$ compared to the huge
amount of features $(p)$. This "$n<<p$" property has hampered application of
deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by
incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution
to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (1) there are
tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (2) the
scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of
convolutional neural networks. To address these issues and build a robust
classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks
(GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep
neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection
between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's
capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and a real data analysis
using a breast cancer RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The
resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature
selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current
classification models and feature selection procedures. The method is available
