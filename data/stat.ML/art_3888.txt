On the Geometry of Message Passing Algorithms for Gaussian Reciprocal
  Processes
Reciprocal processes are acausal generalizations of Markov processes
introduced by Bernstein in 1932. In the literature, a significant amount of
attention has been focused on developing dynamical models for reciprocal
processes. Recently, probabilistic graphical models for reciprocal processes
have been provided. This opens the way to the application of efficient
inference algorithms in the machine learning literature to solve the smoothing
problem for reciprocal processes. Such algorithms are known to converge if the
underlying graph is a tree. This is not the case for a reciprocal process,
whose associated graphical model is a single loop network. The contribution of
this paper is twofold. First, we introduce belief propagation for Gaussian
reciprocal processes. Second, we establish a link between convergence analysis
of belief propagation for Gaussian reciprocal processes and stability theory
for differentially positive systems.
