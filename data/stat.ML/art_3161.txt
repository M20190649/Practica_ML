Concentration for matrix martingales in continuous time and microscopic
  activity of social networks
This paper gives new concentration inequalities for the spectral norm of a
wide class of matrix martingales in continuous time. These results extend
previously established Freedman and Bernstein inequalities for series of random
matrices to the class of continuous time processes. Our analysis relies on a
new supermartingale property of the trace exponential proved within the
framework of stochastic calculus. We provide also several examples that
illustrate the fact that our results allow us to recover easily several
formerly obtained sharp bounds for discrete time matrix martingales.
