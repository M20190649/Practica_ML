On the estimation of initial conditions in kernel-based system
  identification
Recent developments in system identification have brought attention to
regularized kernel-based methods, where, adopting the recently introduced
stable spline kernel, prior information on the unknown process is enforced.
This reduces the variance of the estimates and thus makes kernel-based methods
particularly attractive when few input-output data samples are available. In
such cases however, the influence of the system initial conditions may have a
significant impact on the output dynamics. In this paper, we specifically
address this point. We propose three methods that deal with the estimation of
initial conditions using different types of information. The methods consist in
various mixed maximum likelihood--a posteriori estimators which estimate the
initial conditions and tune the hyperparameters characterizing the stable
spline kernel. To solve the related optimization problems, we resort to the
expectation-maximization method, showing that the solutions can be attained by
iterating among simple update steps. Numerical experiments show the advantages,
in terms of accuracy in reconstructing the system impulse response, of the
proposed strategies, compared to other kernel-based schemes not accounting for
the effect initial conditions.
