Exact ICL maximization in a non-stationary temporal extension of the
  stochastic block model for dynamic networks
The stochastic block model (SBM) is a flexible probabilistic tool that can be
used to model interactions between clusters of nodes in a network. However, it
does not account for interactions of time varying intensity between clusters.
The extension of the SBM developed in this paper addresses this shortcoming
through a temporal partition: assuming interactions between nodes are recorded
on fixed-length time intervals, the inference procedure associated with the
model we propose allows to cluster simultaneously the nodes of the network and
the time intervals. The number of clusters of nodes and of time intervals, as
well as the memberships to clusters, are obtained by maximizing an exact
integrated complete-data likelihood, relying on a greedy search approach.
Experiments on simulated and real data are carried out in order to assess the
proposed methodology.
