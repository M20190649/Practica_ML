Automatic Dimension Selection for a Non-negative Factorization Approach
  to Clustering Multiple Random Graphs
We consider a problem of grouping multiple graphs into several clusters using
singular value thesholding and non-negative factorization. We derive a model
selection information criterion to estimate the number of clusters. We
demonstrate our approach using "Swimmer data set" as well as simulated data
set, and compare its performance with two standard clustering algorithms.
