Assessing Functional Neural Connectivity as an Indicator of Cognitive
  Performance
Studies in recent years have demonstrated that neural organization and
structure impact an individual's ability to perform a given task. Specifically,
individuals with greater neural efficiency have been shown to outperform those
with less organized functional structure. In this work, we compare the
predictive ability of properties of neural connectivity on a working memory
task. We provide two novel approaches for characterizing functional network
connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG), and compare these features to
the average power across frequency bands in EEG channels. Our first novel
approach represents functional connectivity structure through the distribution
of eigenvalues making up channel coherence matrices in multiple frequency
bands. Our second approach creates a connectivity network at each frequency
band, and assesses variability in average path lengths of connected components
and degree across the network. Failures in digit and sentence recall on single
trials are detected using a Gaussian classifier for each feature set, at each
frequency band. The classifier results are then fused across frequency bands,
with the resulting detection performance summarized using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic. Fused AUC results of
0.63/0.58/0.61 for digit recall failure and 0.58/0.59/0.54 for sentence recall
failure are obtained from the connectivity structure, graph variability, and
channel power features respectively.
