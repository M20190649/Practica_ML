String Gaussian Process Kernels
We introduce a new class of nonstationary kernels, which we derive as
covariance functions of a novel family of stochastic processes we refer to as
string Gaussian processes (string GPs). We construct string GPs to allow for
multiple types of local patterns in the data, while ensuring a mild global
regularity condition. In this paper, we illustrate the efficacy of the approach
using synthetic data and demonstrate that the model outperforms competing
approaches on well studied, real-life datasets that exhibit nonstationary
features.
