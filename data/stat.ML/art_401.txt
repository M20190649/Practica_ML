Optimal Schatten-q and Ky-Fan-k Norm Rate of Low Rank Matrix Estimation
In this paper, we consider low rank matrix estimation using either
matrix-version Dantzig Selector $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^d$ or matrix-version LASSO
estimator $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^L$. We consider sub-Gaussian measurements, $i.e.$,
the measurements $X_1,\ldots,X_n\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ have $i.i.d.$
sub-Gaussian entries. Suppose $\textrm{rank}(A_0)=r$. We proved that, when
$n\geq Cm[r^2\vee r\log(m)\log(n)]$ for some $C>0$, both $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^d$
and $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^L$ can obtain optimal upper bounds(except some
logarithmic terms) for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. By applying
metric entropy of Grassmann manifolds, we construct (near) matching minimax
lower bound for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. We also give upper
bounds and matching minimax lower bound(except some logarithmic terms) for
estimation accuracy under Schatten-q norm for every $1\leq q\leq\infty$. As a
direct corollary, we show both upper bounds and minimax lower bounds of
estimation accuracy under Ky-Fan-k norms for every $1\leq k\leq m$.
