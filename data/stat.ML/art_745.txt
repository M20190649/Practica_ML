Post-Regularization Inference for Time-Varying Nonparanormal Graphical
  Models
We propose a novel class of time-varying nonparanormal graphical models,
which allows us to model high dimensional heavy-tailed systems and the
evolution of their latent network structures. Under this model, we develop
statistical tests for presence of edges both locally at a fixed index value and
globally over a range of values. The tests are developed for a high-dimensional
regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly
assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high
dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel
smoothed Kendall's tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator
consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly
in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is
shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical
simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set.
