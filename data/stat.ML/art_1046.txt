Extreme Stochastic Variational Inference: Distributed and Asynchronous
Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for
scaling variational inference to large-datasets, is inherently serial.
Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single
processor; this is problematic when the number of parameters is in billions. In
this paper, we propose extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), an
asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for
mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations
of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a
subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism
simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESVI by running Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on UMBC-3B, a dataset that has a vocabulary of 3
million and a token size of 3 billion. In our experiments, we found that ESVI
not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better
quality solution. In addition, we propose a strategy to speed up computation
and save memory when fitting large number of topics.
