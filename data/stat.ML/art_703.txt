Streaming regularization parameter selection via stochastic gradient
  descent
We propose a framework to perform streaming covariance selection. Our
approach employs regularization constraints where a time-varying sparsity
parameter is iteratively estimated via stochastic gradient descent. This allows
for the regularization parameter to be efficiently learnt in an online manner.
The proposed framework is developed for linear regression models and extended
to graphical models via neighbourhood selection. Under mild assumptions, we are
able to obtain convergence results in a non-stochastic setting. The
capabilities of such an approach are demonstrated using both synthetic data as
well as neuroimaging data.
