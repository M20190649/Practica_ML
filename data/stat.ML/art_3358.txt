Variable subset selection via GA and information complexity in mixtures
  of Poisson and negative binomial regression models
Count data, for example the number of observed cases of a disease in a city,
often arise in the fields of healthcare analytics and epidemiology. In this
paper, we consider performing regression on multivariate data in which our
outcome is a count. Specifically, we derive log-likelihood functions for finite
mixtures of regression models involving counts that come from a Poisson
distribution, as well as a negative binomial distribution when the counts are
significantly overdispersed. Within our proposed modeling framework, we carry
out optimal component selection using the information criteria scores AIC, BIC,
CAIC, and ICOMP. We demonstrate applications of our approach on simulated data,
as well as on a real data set of HIV cases in Tennessee counties from the year
2010. Finally, using a genetic algorithm within our framework, we perform
variable subset selection to determine the covariates that are most responsible
for categorizing Tennessee counties. This leads to some interesting insights
into the traits of counties that have high HIV counts.
