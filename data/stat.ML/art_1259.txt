Dictionary-based Tensor Canonical Polyadic Decomposition
To ensure interpretability of extracted sources in tensor decomposition, we
introduce in this paper a dictionary-based tensor canonical polyadic
decomposition which enforces one factor to belong exactly to a known
dictionary. A new formulation of sparse coding is proposed which enables high
dimensional tensors dictionary-based canonical polyadic decomposition. The
benefits of using a dictionary in tensor decomposition models are explored both
in terms of parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy. Performances of
the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the decomposition of simulated data
and the unmixing of hyperspectral images.
