Polish to English Statistical Machine Translation
This research explores the effects of various training settings on a Polish
to English Statistical Machine Translation system for spoken language. Various
elements of the TED, Europarl, and OPUS parallel text corpora were used as the
basis for training of language models, for development, tuning and testing of
the translation system. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER metrics were used to
evaluate the effects of the data preparations on the translation results.
