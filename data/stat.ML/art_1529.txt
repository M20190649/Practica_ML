Vertex nomination: The canonical sampling and the extended spectral
  nomination schemes
Suppose that one particular block in a stochastic block model is deemed
"interesting," but block labels are only observed for a few of the vertices.
Utilizing a graph realized from the model, the vertex nomination task is to
order the vertices with unobserved block labels into a "nomination list" with
the goal of having an abundance of interesting vertices near the top of the
list. In this paper we extend and enhance two basic vertex nomination schemes;
the canonical nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^C$ and the spectral partitioning
nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^P$.
  The canonical nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^C$ is provably optimal, but is
computationally intractable, being impractical to implement even on modestly
sized graphs. With this in mind, we introduce a scalable, Markov chain Monte
Carlo-based nomination scheme, called the {\it canonical sampling nomination
scheme} ${\mathcal L}^{CS}$, that converges to the canonical nomination scheme
${\mathcal L}^{C}$ as the amount of sampling goes to infinity. We also
introduce a novel spectral partitioning nomination scheme called the {\it
extended spectral partitioning nomination scheme} ${\mathcal L}^{EP}$.
Real-data and simulation experiments are employed to illustrate the
effectiveness of these vertex nomination schemes, as well as their empirical
computational complexity.
