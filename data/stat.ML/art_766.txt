Robust Kernel (Cross-) Covariance Operators in Reproducing Kernel
  Hilbert Space toward Kernel Methods
To the best of our knowledge, there are no general well-founded robust
methods for statistical unsupervised learning. Most of the unsupervised methods
explicitly or implicitly depend on the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO)
or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). They are sensitive to
contaminated data, even when using bounded positive definite kernels. First, we
propose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel
crosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss
function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence
function of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel
CCA). Third, using this influence function, we propose a visualization method
to detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a
method based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel
CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than
classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel
methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments
on synthesized and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed
visualization and robust kernel CCA can be applied effectively to both ideal
data and contaminated data. The robust methods show the superior performance
over the state-of-the-art methods.
