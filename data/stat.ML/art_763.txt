Selective Inference Approach for Statistically Sound Predictive Pattern
  Mining
Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important
challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of
taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact
that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in
databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern
mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is
built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called
selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as
statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions
conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a
tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection
bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to
characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main
contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of
predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic
framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically
significant patterns from databases.
