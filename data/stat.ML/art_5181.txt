MEBoost: Variable Selection in the Presence of Measurement Error
We present a novel method for variable selection in regression models when
covariates are measured with error. The iterative algorithm we propose,
MEBoost, follows a path defined by estimating equations that correct for
covariate measurement error. Via simulation, we evaluated our method and
compare its performance to the recently-proposed Convex Conditioned Lasso
(CoCoLasso) and to the "naive" Lasso which does not correct for measurement
error. Increasing the degree of measurement error increased prediction error
and decreased the probability of accurate covariate selection, but this loss of
accuracy was least pronounced when using MEBoost. We illustrate the use of
MEBoost in practice by analyzing data from the Box Lunch Study, a clinical
trial in nutrition where several variables are based on self-report and hence
measured with error.
