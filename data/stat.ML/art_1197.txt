Spectral Clustering using PCKID - A Probabilistic Cluster Kernel for
  Incomplete Data
In this paper, we propose PCKID, a novel, robust, kernel function for
spectral clustering, specifically designed to handle incomplete data. By
combining posterior distributions of Gaussian Mixture Models for incomplete
data on different scales, we are able to learn a kernel for incomplete data
that does not depend on any critical hyperparameters, unlike the commonly used
RBF kernel. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on two real
datasets. PCKID outperforms the baseline methods for all fractions of missing
values and in some cases outperforms the baseline methods with up to 25
percentage points.
