A unifying framework for relaxations of the causal assumptions in Bell's
  theorem
Bell's Theorem shows that quantum mechanical correlations can violate the
constraints that the causal structure of certain experiments impose on any
classical explanation. It is thus natural to ask to which degree the causal
assumptions -- e.g. locality or measurement independence -- have to be relaxed
in order to allow for a classical description of such experiments. Here, we
develop a conceptual and computational framework for treating this problem. We
employ the language of Bayesian networks to systematically construct
alternative causal structures and bound the degree of relaxation using
quantitative measures that originate from the mathematical theory of causality.
The main technical insight is that the resulting problems can often be
expressed as computationally tractable linear programs. We demonstrate the
versatility of the framework by applying it to a variety of scenarios, ranging
from relaxations of the measurement independence, locality and bilocality
assumptions, to a novel causal interpretation of CHSH inequality violations.
