An experimental study of graph-based semi-supervised classification with
  additional node information
The volume of data generated by internet and social networks is increasing
every day, and there is a clear need for efficient ways of extracting useful
information from them. As those data can take different forms, it is important
to use all the available data representations for prediction.
  In this paper, we focus our attention on supervised classification using both
regular plain, tabular, data and structural information coming from a network
structure. 14 techniques are investigated and compared in this study and can be
divided in three classes: the first one uses only the plain data to build a
classification model, the second uses only the graph structure and the last
uses both information sources. The relative performances in these three cases
are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using a graph embedding and
well-known indicators in spatial statistics is also studied.
  Possible applications are automatic classification of web pages or other
linked documents, of people in a social network or of proteins in a biological
complex system, to name a few.
  Based on our comparison, we draw some general conclusions and advices to
tackle this particular classification task: some datasets can be better
explained by their graph structure (graph-driven), or by their feature set
(features-driven). The most efficient methods are discussed in both cases.
