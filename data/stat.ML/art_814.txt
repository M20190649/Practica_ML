Spatio-temporal Gaussian processes modeling of dynamical systems in
  systems biology
Quantitative modeling of post-transcriptional regulation process is a
challenging problem in systems biology. A mechanical model of the regulatory
process needs to be able to describe the available spatio-temporal protein
concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the continuous
spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are required to identify model
parameters. A promising approach to deal with these difficulties is proposed
using Gaussian process as a prior distribution over the latent function of
protein concentration and mRNA expression. In this study, we consider a partial
differential equation mechanical model with differential operators and latent
function. Since the operators at stake are linear, the information from the
physical model can be encoded into the kernel function. Hybrid Monte Carlo
methods are employed to carry out Bayesian inference of the partial
differential equation parameters and Gaussian process kernel parameters. The
spatio-temporal field of protein concentration and mRNA expression are
reconstructed without explicitly solving the partial differential equation.
