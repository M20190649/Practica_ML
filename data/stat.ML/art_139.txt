Unified Treatment of Hidden Markov Switching Models
Many real-world problems encountered in several disciplines deal with the
modeling of time-series containing different underlying dynamical regimes, for
which probabilistic approaches are very often employed. In this paper we
describe several such approaches in the common framework of graphical models.
We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature,
which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables
us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not
observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference
routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint.
