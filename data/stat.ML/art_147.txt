Restricted Collapsed Draw: Accurate Sampling for Hierarchical Chinese
  Restaurant Process Hidden Markov Models
We propose a restricted collapsed draw (RCD) sampler, a general Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampler of simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Chinese
restaurant process (HCRP) with restriction. Models that require simultaneous
draws from a hierarchical Dirichlet process with restriction, such as infinite
Hidden markov models (iHMM), were difficult to enjoy benefits of \markerg{the}
HCRP due to combinatorial explosion in calculating distributions of coupled
draws. By constructing a proposal of seating arrangements (partitioning) and
stochastically accepts the proposal by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the
RCD sampler makes accurate sampling for complex combination of draws while
retaining efficiency of HCRP representation. Based on the RCD sampler, we
developed a series of sophisticated sampling algorithms for iHMMs, including
blocked Gibbs sampling, beam sampling, and split-merge sampling, that
outperformed conventional iHMM samplers in experiments
