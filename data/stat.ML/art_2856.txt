Beyond Bell's Theorem II: Scenarios with arbitrary causal structure
It has recently been found that Bell scenarios are only a small subclass of
interesting setups for studying the non-classical features of quantum theory
within spacetime. We find that it is possible to talk about classical
correlations, quantum correlations and other kinds of correlations on any
directed acyclic graph, and this captures various extensions of Bell scenarios
which have been considered in the literature. From a conceptual point of view,
the main feature of our approach is its high level of unification: while the
notions of source, choice of setting and measurement play all seemingly
different roles in a Bell scenario, our formalism shows that they are all
instances of the same concept of "event".
  Our work can also be understood as a contribution to the subject of causal
inference with latent variables. Among other things, we introduce hidden
Bayesian networks as a generalization of hidden Markov models.
