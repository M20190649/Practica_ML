Generalized notions of sparsity and restricted isometry property. Part
  I: A unified framework
The restricted isometry property (RIP) is an integral tool in the analysis of
various inverse problems with sparsity models. Motivated by the applications of
compressed sensing and dimensionality reduction of low-rank tensors, we propose
generalized notions of sparsity and provide a unified framework for the
corresponding RIP, in particular when combined with isotropic group actions.
Our results extend an approach by Rudelson and Vershynin to a much broader
context including commutative and noncommutative function spaces. Moreover, our
Banach space notion of sparsity applies to affine group actions. The
generalized approach in particular applies to high order tensor products.
