The CMA Evolution Strategy: A Tutorial
This tutorial introduces the CMA Evolution Strategy (ES), where CMA stands
for Covariance Matrix Adaptation. The CMA-ES is a stochastic, or randomized,
method for real-parameter (continuous domain) optimization of non-linear,
non-convex functions. We try to motivate and derive the algorithm from
intuitive concepts and from requirements of non-linear, non-convex search in
continuous domain.
