On the Equivalence of Factorized Information Criterion Regularization
  and the Chinese Restaurant Process Prior
Factorized Information Criterion (FIC) is a recently developed information
criterion, based on which a novel model selection methodology, namely
Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) Inference, has been developed and
successfully applied to various hierarchical Bayesian models. The Dirichlet
Process (DP) prior, and one of its well known representations, the Chinese
Restaurant Process (CRP), derive another line of model selection methods. FIC
can be viewed as a prior distribution over the latent variable configurations.
Under this view, we prove that when the parameter dimensionality $D_{c}=2$, FIC
is equivalent to CRP. We argue that when $D_{c}>2$, FIC avoids an inherent
problem of DP/CRP, i.e. the data likelihood will dominate the impact of the
prior, and thus the model selection capability will weaken as $D_{c}$
increases. However, FIC overestimates the data likelihood. As a result, FIC may
be overly biased towards models with less components. We propose a natural
generalization of FIC, which finds a middle ground between CRP and FIC, and may
yield more accurate model selection results than FIC.
