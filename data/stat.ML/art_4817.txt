Gamblets for opening the complexity-bottleneck of implicit schemes for
  hyperbolic and parabolic ODEs/PDEs with rough coefficients
Implicit schemes are popular methods for the integration of time dependent
PDEs such as hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs. However the necessity to solve
corresponding linear systems at each time step constitutes a complexity
bottleneck in their application to PDEs with rough coefficients. We present a
generalization of gamblets introduced in \cite{OwhadiMultigrid:2015} enabling
the resolution of these implicit systems in near-linear complexity and provide
rigorous a-priori error bounds on the resulting numerical approximations of
hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs. These generalized gamblets induce a
multiresolution decomposition of the solution space that is adapted to both the
underlying (hyperbolic and parabolic) PDE (and the system of ODEs resulting
from space discretization) and to the time-steps of the numerical scheme.
