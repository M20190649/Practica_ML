Differentially Private Data Releasing for Smooth Queries with Synthetic
  Database Output
We consider accurately answering smooth queries while preserving differential
privacy. A query is said to be $K$-smooth if it is specified by a function
defined on $[-1,1]^d$ whose partial derivatives up to order $K$ are all
bounded. We develop an $\epsilon$-differentially private mechanism for the
class of $K$-smooth queries. The major advantage of the algorithm is that it
outputs a synthetic database. In real applications, a synthetic database output
is appealing. Our mechanism achieves an accuracy of $O
(n^{-\frac{K}{2d+K}}/\epsilon )$, and runs in polynomial time. We also
generalize the mechanism to preserve $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
with slightly improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the mechanisms have good accuracy and are efficient.
