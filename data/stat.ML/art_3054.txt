Stochastic Blockmodeling for Online Advertising
Online advertising is an important and huge industry. Having knowledge of the
website attributes can contribute greatly to business strategies for
ad-targeting, content display, inventory purchase or revenue prediction.
Classical inferences on users and sites impose challenge, because the data is
voluminous, sparse, high-dimensional and noisy. In this paper, we introduce a
stochastic blockmodeling for the website relations induced by the event of
online user visitation. We propose two clustering algorithms to discover the
instrinsic structures of websites, and compare the performance with a
goodness-of-fit method and a deterministic graph partitioning method. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both simulation and AOL
website dataset.
