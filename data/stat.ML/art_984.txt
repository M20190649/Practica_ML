Distributional Equivalence and Structure Learning for Bow-free Acyclic
  Path Diagrams
We consider the problem of structure learning for bow-free acyclic path
diagrams (BAPs). BAPs can be viewed as a generalization of linear Gaussian DAG
models that allow for certain hidden variables. We present a first method for
this problem using a greedy score-based search algorithm. We also prove some
necessary and some sufficient conditions for distributional equivalence of BAPs
which are used in an algorithmic ap- proach to compute (nearly) equivalent
model structures. This allows us to infer lower bounds of causal effects. We
also present applications to real and simulated datasets using our publicly
available R-package.
