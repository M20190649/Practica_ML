Learning Non-Parametric Basis Independent Models from Point Queries via
  Low-Rank Methods
We consider the problem of learning multi-ridge functions of the form f(x) =
g(Ax) from point evaluations of f. We assume that the function f is defined on
an l_2-ball in R^d, g is twice continuously differentiable almost everywhere,
and A \in R^{k \times d} is a rank k matrix, where k << d. We propose a
randomized, polynomial-complexity sampling scheme for estimating such
functions. Our theoretical developments leverage recent techniques from low
rank matrix recovery, which enables us to derive a polynomial time estimator of
the function f along with uniform approximation guarantees. We prove that our
scheme can also be applied for learning functions of the form: f(x) =
\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i(a_i^T x), provided f satisfies certain smoothness conditions
in a neighborhood around the origin. We also characterize the noise robustness
of the scheme. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the
theoretical bounds in action.
