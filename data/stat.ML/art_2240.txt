Signal Recovery in Unions of Subspaces with Applications to Compressive
  Imaging
In applications ranging from communications to genetics, signals can be
modeled as lying in a union of subspaces. Under this model, signal coefficients
that lie in certain subspaces are active or inactive together. The potential
subspaces are known in advance, but the particular set of subspaces that are
active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show
that exploiting knowledge of subspaces can further reduce the number of
measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds
for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that
it only depends on the number of subspaces under consideration, and their
orientation relative to each other. The particulars of the subspaces (e.g.,
compositions, dimensions, extents, overlaps, etc.) does not affect the results
we obtain. In the process, we derive sample complexity bounds for the special
case of the group lasso with overlapping groups (the latent group lasso), which
is used in a variety of applications. Finally, we also show that wavelet
transform coefficients of images can be modeled as lying in groups, and hence
can be efficiently recovered using group lasso methods.
