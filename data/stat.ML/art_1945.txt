Semi-blind Sparse Image Reconstruction with Application to MRFM
We propose a solution to the image deconvolution problem where the
convolution kernel or point spread function (PSF) is assumed to be only
partially known. Small perturbations generated from the model are exploited to
produce a few principal components explaining the PSF uncertainty in a high
dimensional space. Unlike recent developments on blind deconvolution of natural
images, we assume the image is sparse in the pixel basis, a natural sparsity
arising in magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). Our approach adopts a
Bayesian Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. The performance of our
Bayesian semi-blind algorithm for sparse images is superior to previously
proposed semi-blind algorithms such as the alternating minimization (AM)
algorithm and blind algorithms developed for natural images. We illustrate our
myopic algorithm on real MRFM tobacco virus data.
