Model-based Dashboards for Customer Analytics
Automating the customer analytics process is crucial for companies that
manage distinct customer bases. In such data-rich and dynamic environments,
visualization plays a key role in understanding events of interest. These ideas
have led to the popularity of analytics dashboards, yet academic research has
paid scant attention to these managerial needs. We develop a probabilistic,
nonparametric framework for understanding and predicting individual-level
spending using Gaussian process priors over latent functions that describe
customer spending along calendar time, interpurchase time, and customer
lifetime dimensions. These curves form a dashboard that provides a visual
model-based representation of purchasing dynamics that is easily
comprehensible. The model flexibly and automatically captures the form and
duration of the impact of events that influence spend propensity, even when
such events are unknown a-priori. We illustrate the use of our Gaussian Process
Propensity Model (GPPM) on data from two popular mobile games. We show that the
GPPM generalizes hazard and buy-till-you-die models by incorporating calendar
time dynamics while simultaneously accounting for recency and lifetime effects.
It therefore provides insights about spending propensity beyond those available
from these models. Finally, we show that the GPPM outperforms these benchmarks
both in fitting and forecasting real and simulated spend data.
