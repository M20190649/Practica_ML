Model Criticism in Latent Space
Model criticism is usually carried out by assessing if replicated data
generated under the fitted model looks similar to the observed data, see e.g.
Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin [2004, p. 165]. This paper presents a method
for latent variable models by pulling back the data into the space of latent
variables, and carrying out model criticism in that space. Making use of a
model's structure enables a more direct assessment of the assumptions made in
the prior and likelihood. We demonstrate the method with examples of model
criticism in latent space applied to factor analysis, linear dynamical systems
and Gaussian processes.
