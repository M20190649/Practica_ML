The Discrete Infinite Logistic Normal Distribution
We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a
Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a
generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models
correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We
derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed
random variables, and study its statistical properties. We consider
applications to topic modeling and derive a variational inference algorithm for
approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical performance of the DILN
topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the
correlated topic model (CTM). To deal with large-scale data sets, we also
develop an online inference algorithm for DILN and compare with online HDP and
online LDA on the Nature magazine, which contains approximately 350,000
articles.
