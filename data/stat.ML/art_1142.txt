Characterizing the maximum parameter of the total-variation denoising
  through the pseudo-inverse of the divergence
We focus on the maximum regularization parameter for anisotropic
total-variation denoising. It corresponds to the minimum value of the
regularization parameter above which the solution remains constant. While this
value is well know for the Lasso, such a critical value has not been
investigated in details for the total-variation. Though, it is of importance
when tuning the regularization parameter as it allows fixing an upper-bound on
the grid for which the optimal parameter is sought. We establish a closed form
expression for the one-dimensional case, as well as an upper-bound for the
two-dimensional case, that appears reasonably tight in practice. This problem
is directly linked to the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the divergence,
which can be quickly obtained by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain.
