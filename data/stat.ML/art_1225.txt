Practical Bayesian Optimization for Variable Cost Objectives
We propose a novel Bayesian Optimization approach for black-box functions
with an environmental variable whose value determines the tradeoff between
evaluation cost and the fidelity of the evaluations. Further, we use a novel
approach to sampling support points, allowing faster construction of the
acquisition function. This allows us to achieve optimization with lower
overheads than previous approaches and is implemented for a more general class
of problem. We show this approach to be effective on synthetic and real world
benchmark problems.
