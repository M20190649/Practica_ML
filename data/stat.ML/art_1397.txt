Statistical Inference for Data-adaptive Doubly Robust Estimators with
  Survival Outcomes
The consistency of doubly robust estimators relies on consistent estimation
of at least one of two nuisance regression parameters. In moderate to large
dimensions, the use of flexible data-adaptive regression estimators may aid in
achieving this consistency. However, $n^{1/2}$-consistency of doubly robust
estimators is not guaranteed if one of the nuisance estimators is inconsistent.
In this paper we present a doubly robust estimator for survival analysis with
the novel property that it converges to a Gaussian variable at $n^{1/2}$-rate
for a large class of data-adaptive estimators of the nuisance parameters, under
the only assumption that at least one of them is consistently estimated at a
$n^{1/4}$-rate. This result is achieved through adaptation of recent ideas in
semiparametric inference, which amount to: (i) Gaussianizing (i.e., making
asymptotically linear) a drift term that arises in the asymptotic analysis of
the doubly robust estimator, and (ii) using cross-fitting to avoid entropy
conditions on the nuisance estimators. We present the formula of the asymptotic
variance of the estimator, which allows computation of doubly robust confidence
intervals and p-values. We illustrate the finite-sample properties of the
estimator in simulation studies, and demonstrate its use in a phase III
clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment
of HER2 positive breast cancer.
