Sparsity by Worst-Case Penalties
This paper proposes a new interpretation of sparse penalties such as the
elastic-net and the group-lasso. Beyond providing a new viewpoint on these
penalization schemes, our approach results in a unified optimization strategy.
Our experiments demonstrate that this strategy, implemented on the elastic-net,
is computationally extremely efficient for small to medium size problems. Our
accompanying software solves problems very accurately, at machine precision, in
the time required to get a rough estimate with competing state-of-the-art
algorithms. We illustrate on real and artificial datasets that this accuracy is
required to for the correctness of the support of the solution, which is an
important element for the interpretability of sparsity-inducing penalties.
