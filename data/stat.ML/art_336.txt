Nonlinear unmixing of hyperspectral images using a semiparametric model
  and spatial regularization
Incorporating spatial information into hyperspectral unmixing procedures has
been shown to have positive effects, due to the inherent spatial-spectral
duality in hyperspectral scenes. Current research works that consider spatial
information are mainly focused on the linear mixing model. In this paper, we
investigate a variational approach to incorporating spatial correlation into a
nonlinear unmixing procedure. A nonlinear algorithm operating in reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces, associated with an $\ell_1$ local variation norm as the
spatial regularizer, is derived. Experimental results, with both synthetic and
real data, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
