Regularization and Bayesian Learning in Dynamical Systems: Past, Present
  and Future
Regularization and Bayesian methods for system identification have been
repopularized in the recent years, and proved to be competitive w.r.t.
classical parametric approaches. In this paper we shall make an attempt to
illustrate how the use of regularization in system identification has evolved
over the years, starting from the early contributions both in the Automatic
Control as well as Econometrics and Statistics literature. In particular we
shall discuss some fundamental issues such as compound estimation problems and
exchangeability which play and important role in regularization and Bayesian
approaches, as also illustrated in early publications in Statistics. The
historical and foundational issues will be given more emphasis (and space), at
the expense of the more recent developments which are only briefly discussed.
The main reason for such a choice is that, while the recent literature is
readily available, and surveys have already been published on the subject, in
the author's opinion a clear link with past work had not been completely
clarified.
