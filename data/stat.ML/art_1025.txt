Destination Prediction by Trajectory Distribution Based Model
In this paper we propose a new method to predict the final destination of
vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first review how
we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we
explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian
distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which
produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present
how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory
based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the
new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use
characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final
destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for
classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of
timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different
datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to
different subsets.
