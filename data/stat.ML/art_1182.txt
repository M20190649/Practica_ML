An Efficient, Expressive and Local Minima-free Method for Learning
  Controlled Dynamical Systems
We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled
dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and
receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the
Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key
property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional
distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this
representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to
achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent
controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient
and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric
representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear
dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an
experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
