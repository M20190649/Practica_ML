Genomic Prediction of Quantitative Traits using Sparse and Locally
  Epistatic Models
In plant and animal breeding studies a distinction is made between the
genetic value (additive + epistatic genetic effects) and the breeding value
(additive genetic effects) of an individual since it is expected that some of
the epistatic genetic effects will be lost due to recombination. In this paper,
we argue that the breeder can take advantage of some of the epistatic marker
effects in regions of low recombination. The models introduced here aim to
estimate local epistatic line heritability by using the genetic map information
and combine the local additive and epistatic effects. To this end, we have used
semi-parametric mixed models with multiple local genomic relationship matrices
with hierarchical designs and lasso post-processing for sparsity in the final
model. Our models produce good predictive performance along with good
explanatory information.
