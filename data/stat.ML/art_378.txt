Identifiability of an Integer Modular Acyclic Additive Noise Model and
  its Causal Structure Discovery
The notion of causality is used in many situations dealing with uncertainty.
We consider the problem whether causality can be identified given data set
generated by discrete random variables rather than continuous ones. In
particular, for non-binary data, thus far it was only known that causality can
be identified except rare cases. In this paper, we present necessary and
sufficient condition for an integer modular acyclic additive noise (IMAN) of
two variables. In addition, we relate bivariate and multivariate causal
identifiability in a more explicit manner, and develop a practical algorithm to
find the order of variables and their parent sets. We demonstrate its
performance in applications to artificial data and real world body motion data
with comparisons to conventional methods.
