Likelihood Inflating Sampling Algorithm
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a posterior distribution
corresponding to a massive data set can be computationally prohibitive since
producing one sample requires a number of operations that is linear in the data
size. In this paper, we introduce a new communication-free parallel method, the
Likelihood Inflating Sampling Algorithm (LISA), that significantly reduces
computational costs by randomly splitting the dataset into smaller subsets and
running MCMC methods independently in parallel on each subset using different
processors. Each processor will be used to run an MCMC chain that samples
sub-posterior distributions which are defined using an "inflated" likelihood
function. We develop a strategy for combining the draws from different
sub-posteriors to study the full posterior of the Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART) model. The performance of the method is tested using both
simulated and real data.
