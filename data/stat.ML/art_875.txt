GAN and VAE from an Optimal Transport Point of View
This short article revisits some of the ideas introduced in arXiv:1701.07875
and arXiv:1705.07642 in a simple setup. This sheds some lights on the
connexions between Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) and Minimum Kantorovitch Estimators (MKE).
