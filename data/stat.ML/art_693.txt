Cascaded High Dimensional Histograms: A Generative Approach to Density
  Estimation
We present tree- and list- structured density estimation methods for high
dimensional binary/categorical data. Our density estimation models are high
dimensional analogies to variable bin width histograms. In each leaf of the
tree (or list), the density is constant, similar to the flat density within the
bin of a histogram. Histograms, however, cannot easily be visualized in higher
dimensions, whereas our models can. The accuracy of histograms fades as
dimensions increase, whereas our models have priors that help with
generalization. Our models are sparse, unlike high-dimensional histograms. We
present three generative models, where the first one allows the user to specify
the number of desired leaves in the tree within a Bayesian prior. The second
model allows the user to specify the desired number of branches within the
prior. The third model returns lists (rather than trees) and allows the user to
specify the desired number of rules and the length of rules within the prior.
Our results indicate that the new approaches yield a better balance between
sparsity and accuracy of density estimates than other methods for this task.
