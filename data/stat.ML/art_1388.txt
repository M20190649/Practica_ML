Towards life cycle identification of malaria parasites using machine
  learning and Riemannian geometry
Malaria is a serious infectious disease that is responsible for over half
million deaths yearly worldwide. The major cause of these mortalities is late
or inaccurate diagnosis. Manual microscopy is currently considered as the
dominant diagnostic method for malaria. However, it is time consuming and prone
to human errors. The aim of this paper is to automate the diagnosis process and
minimize the human intervention. We have developed the hardware and software
for a cost-efficient malaria diagnostic system. This paper describes the
manufactured hardware and also proposes novel software to handle parasite
detection and life-stage identification. A motorized microscope is developed to
take images from Giemsa-stained blood smears. A patch-based unsupervised
statistical clustering algorithm is proposed which offers a novel method for
classification of different regions within blood images. The proposed method
provides better robustness against different imaging settings. The core of the
proposed algorithm is a model called Mixture of Independent Component Analysis.
A manifold based optimization method is proposed that facilitates the
application of the model for high dimensional data usually acquired in medical
microscopy. The method was tested on 600 blood slides with various imaging
conditions. The speed of the method is higher than current supervised systems
while its accuracy is comparable to or better than them.
