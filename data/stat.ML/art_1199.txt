Deep Nonparametric Estimation of Discrete Conditional Distributions via
  Smoothed Dyadic Partitioning
We present an approach to deep estimation of discrete conditional probability
distributions. Such models have several applications, including generative
modeling of audio, image, and video data. Our approach combines two main
techniques: dyadic partitioning and graph-based smoothing of the discrete
space. By recursively decomposing each dimension into a series of binary splits
and smoothing over the resulting distribution using graph-based trend
filtering, we impose a strict structure to the model and achieve much higher
sample efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model through a series
of benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in some cases reducing
the error by nearly half in comparison to other popular methods in the
literature. All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow and publicly
available at https://github.com/tansey/sdp .
