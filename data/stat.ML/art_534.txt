Laplacian Mixture Modeling for Network Analysis and Unsupervised
  Learning on Graphs
Laplacian mixture models identify overlapping regions of influence in
unlabeled graph and network data in a scalable and computationally efficient
way, yielding useful low-dimensional representations. By combining Laplacian
eigenspace and finite mixture modeling methods, they provide probabilistic or
fuzzy dimensionality reductions or domain decompositions for a variety of input
data types, including mixture distributions, feature vectors, and graphs or
networks. Provable optimal recovery using the algorithm is analytically shown
for a nontrivial class of cluster graphs. Heuristic approximations for scalable
high-performance implementations are described and empirically tested.
Connections to PageRank and community detection in network analysis demonstrate
the wide applicability of this approach. The origins of fuzzy spectral methods,
beginning with generalized heat or diffusion equations in physics, are reviewed
and summarized. Comparisons to other dimensionality reduction and clustering
methods for challenging unsupervised machine learning problems are also
discussed.
