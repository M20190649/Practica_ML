The Group Lasso for Design of Experiments
We introduce an application of the group lasso to design of experiments. Note
that we are NOT trying to explain experimental design for the group lasso.
Conversely, we explain how we can use the idea of the group lasso in
experimental design, showing that the problem of constructing an optimal design
matrix can be transformed into a problem of the group lasso. In some numerical
examples, we show that we can obtain the orthogonal arrays as the solutions of
the group lasso problems.
