Optimal whitening and decorrelation
Whitening, or sphering, is a common preprocessing step in statistical
analysis to transform random variables to orthogonality. However, due to
rotational freedom there are infinitely many possible whitening procedures.
Consequently, there is a diverse range of sphering methods in use, for example
based on principal component analysis (PCA), Cholesky matrix decomposition and
zero-phase component analysis (ZCA), among others.
  Here we provide an overview of the underlying theory and discuss five natural
whitening procedures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that investigating the
cross-covariance and the cross-correlation matrix between sphered and original
variables allows to break the rotational invariance and to identify optimal
whitening transformations. As a result we recommend two particular approaches:
ZCA-cor whitening to produce sphered variables that are maximally similar to
the original variables, and PCA-cor whitening to obtain sphered variables that
maximally compress the original variables.
