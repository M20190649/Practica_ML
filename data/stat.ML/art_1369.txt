Health Analytics: a systematic review of approaches to detect phenotype
  cohorts using electronic health records
The paper presents a systematic review of state-of-the-art approaches to
identify patient cohorts using electronic health records. It gives a
comprehensive overview of the most commonly de-tected phenotypes and its
underlying data sets. Special attention is given to preprocessing of in-put
data and the different modeling approaches. The literature review confirms
natural language processing to be a promising approach for electronic
phenotyping. However, accessibility and lack of natural language process
standards for medical texts remain a challenge. Future research should develop
such standards and further investigate which machine learning approaches are
best suited to which type of medical data.
