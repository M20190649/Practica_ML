Learning to Predict with Highly Granular Temporal Data: Estimating
  individual behavioral profiles with smart meter data
Big spatio-temporal datasets, available through both open and administrative
data sources, offer significant potential for social science research. The
magnitude of the data allows for increased resolution and analysis at
individual level. While there are recent advances in forecasting techniques for
highly granular temporal data, little attention is given to segmenting the time
series and finding homogeneous patterns. In this paper, it is proposed to
estimate behavioral profiles of individuals' activities over time using
Gaussian Process-based models. In particular, the aim is to investigate how
individuals or groups may be clustered according to the model parameters. Such
a Bayesian non-parametric method is then tested by looking at the
predictability of the segments using a combination of models to fit different
parts of the temporal profiles. Model validity is then tested on a set of
holdout data. The dataset consists of half hourly energy consumption records
from smart meters from more than 100,000 households in the UK and covers the
period from 2015 to 2016. The methodological approach developed in the paper
may be easily applied to datasets of similar structure and granularity, for
example social media data, and may lead to improved accuracy in the prediction
of social dynamics and behavior.
