Locally-adapted convolution-based super-resolution of
  irregularly-sampled ocean remote sensing data
Super-resolution is a classical problem in image processing, with numerous
applications to remote sensing image enhancement. Here, we address the
super-resolution of irregularly-sampled remote sensing images. Using an optimal
interpolation as the low-resolution reconstruction, we explore locally-adapted
multimodal convolutional models and investigate different dictionary-based
decompositions, namely based on principal component analysis (PCA), sparse
priors and non-negativity constraints. We consider an application to the
reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources,
along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The reported
experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model, especially
locally-adapted parametrizations with non-negativity constraints, to outperform
optimally-interpolated reconstructions.
