A Fast and Flexible Algorithm for the Graph-Fused Lasso
We propose a new algorithm for solving the graph-fused lasso (GFL), a method
for parameter estimation that operates under the assumption that the signal
tends to be locally constant over a predefined graph structure. Our key insight
is to decompose the graph into a set of trails which can then each be solved
efficiently using techniques for the ordinary (1D) fused lasso. We leverage
these trails in a proximal algorithm that alternates between closed form primal
updates and fast dual trail updates. The resulting techinque is both faster
than previous GFL methods and more flexible in the choice of loss function and
graph structure. Furthermore, we present two algorithms for constructing trail
sets and show empirically that they offer a tradeoff between preprocessing time
and convergence rate.
