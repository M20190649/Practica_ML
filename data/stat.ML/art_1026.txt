A note on the statistical view of matrix completion
A very simple interpretation of matrix completion problem is introduced based
on statistical models. Combined with the well-known results from missing data
analysis, such interpretation indicates that matrix completion is still a valid
and principled estimation procedure even without the missing completely at
random (MCAR) assumption, which almost all of the current theoretical studies
of matrix completion assume.
