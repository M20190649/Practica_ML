Order-invariant prior specification in Bayesian factor analysis
In (exploratory) factor analysis, the loading matrix is identified only up to
orthogonal rotation. For identifiability, one thus often takes the loading
matrix to be lower triangular with positive diagonal entries. In Bayesian
inference, a standard practice is then to specify a prior under which the
loadings are independent, the off-diagonal loadings are normally distributed,
and the diagonal loadings follow a truncated normal distribution. This prior
specification, however, depends in an important way on how the variables and
associated rows of the loading matrix are ordered. We show how a minor
modification of the approach allows one to compute with the identifiable lower
triangular loading matrix but maintain invariance properties under reordering
of the variables.
