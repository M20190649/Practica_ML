Fast and reliable inference algorithm for hierarchical stochastic block
  models
Network clustering reveals the organization of a network or corresponding
complex system with elements represented as vertices and interactions as edges
in a (directed, weighted) graph. Although the notion of clustering can be
somewhat loose, network clusters or groups are generally considered as nodes
with enriched interactions and edges sharing common patterns. Statistical
inference often treats groups as latent variables, with observed networks
generated from latent group structure, termed a stochastic block model.
Regardless of the definitions, statistical inference can be either translated
to modularity maximization, which is provably an NP-complete problem.
  Here we present scalable and reliable algorithms that recover hierarchical
stochastic block models fast and accurately. Our algorithm scales almost
linearly in number of edges, and inferred models were more accurate that other
scalable methods.
