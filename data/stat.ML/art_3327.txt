Bayesian kernel-based system identification with quantized output data
In this paper we introduce a novel method for linear system identification
with quantized output data. We model the impulse response as a zero-mean
Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed
stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential
stability. This serves as a starting point to cast our system identification
problem into a Bayesian framework. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods to provide an estimate of the system. In particular, we show how to
design a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target distribution.
Numerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the
estimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods when employed in
identification of systems with quantized data.
