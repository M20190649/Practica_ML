Beating level-set methods for 3D seismic data interpolation: a
  primal-dual alternating approach
Acquisition cost is a crucial bottleneck for seismic workflows, and low-rank
formulations for data interpolation allow practitioners to `fill in' data
volumes from critically subsampled data acquired in the field. Tremendous size
of seismic data volumes required for seismic processing remains a major
challenge for these techniques.
  We propose a new approach to solve residual constrained formulations for
interpolation. We represent the data volume using matrix factors, and build a
block-coordinate algorithm with constrained convex subproblems that are solved
with a primal-dual splitting scheme. The new approach is competitive with state
of the art level-set algorithms that interchange the role of objectives with
constraints. We use the new algorithm to successfully interpolate a large scale
5D seismic data volume, generated from the geologically complex synthetic 3D
Compass velocity model, where 80% of the data has been removed.
