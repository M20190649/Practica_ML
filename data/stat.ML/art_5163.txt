High Dimensional Multi-Level Covariance Estimation and Kriging
With the advent of big data sets much of the computational science and
engineering communities have been moving toward data-driven approaches to
regression and classification. However, they present a significant challenge
due to the increasing size, complexity and dimensionality of the problems. In
this paper a multi-level kriging method that scales well with dimensions is
developed. A multi-level basis is constructed that is adapted to a random
projection tree (or kD-tree) partitioning of the observations and a sparse grid
approximation. This approach identifies the high dimensional underlying
phenomena from the noise in an accurate and numerically stable manner.
Furthermore, numerically unstable covariance matrices are transformed into well
conditioned multi-level matrices without compromising accuracy. A-posteriori
error estimates are derived, such as the sub-exponential decay of the
coefficients of the multi-level covariance matrix. The multi-level method is
tested on numerically unstable problems of up to 50 dimensions. Accurate
solutions with feasible computational cost are obtained.
