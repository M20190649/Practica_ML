Robust Local Scaling using Conditional Quantiles of Graph Similarities
Spectral analysis of neighborhood graphs is one of the most widely used
techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from
machine learning to social sciences. In such applications, it is typical to
first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate
similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as
k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice
of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities.
In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale
estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an
auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a
similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of
the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying
data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike
several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and
single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs
outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches.
