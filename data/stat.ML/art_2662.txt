Regularization of $\ell_1$ minimization for dealing with outliers and
  noise in Statistics and Signal Recovery
We study the robustness properties of $\ell_1$ norm minimization for the
classical linear regression problem with a given design matrix and
contamination restricted to the dependent variable. We perform a fine error
analysis of the $\ell_1$ estimator for measurements errors consisting of
outliers coupled with noise. We introduce a new estimation technique resulting
from a regularization of $\ell_1$ minimization by inf-convolution with the
$\ell_2$ norm. Concerning robustness to large outliers, the proposed estimator
keeps the breakdown point of the $\ell_1$ estimator, and reduces to least
squares when there are not outliers. We present a globally convergent
forward-backward algorithm for computing our estimator and some numerical
experiments confirming its theoretical properties.
