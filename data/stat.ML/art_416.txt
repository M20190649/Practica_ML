Causal Inference through a Witness Protection Program
One of the most fundamental problems in causal inference is the estimation of
a causal effect when variables are confounded. This is difficult in an
observational study, because one has no direct evidence that all confounders
have been adjusted for. We introduce a novel approach for estimating causal
effects that exploits observational conditional independencies to suggest
"weak" paths in a unknown causal graph. The widely used faithfulness condition
of Spirtes et al. is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of "path
cancellations" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the
existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution
over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and
Bayesian inference. We claim this approach should be used in regular practice
along with other default tools in observational studies.
