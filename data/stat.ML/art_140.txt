Joint estimation of linear non-Gaussian acyclic models
A linear non-Gaussian structural equation model called LiNGAM is an
identifiable model for exploratory causal analysis. Previous methods estimate a
causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single
dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under
different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a
single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate
multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering
but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed
variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately
than estimating them separately.
