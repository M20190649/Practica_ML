An Improved Oscillating-Error Classifier with Branching
This paper extends the earlier work on an oscillating error correction
technique. Specifically, it extends the design to include further corrections,
by adding new layers to the classifier through a branching method. This
technique is still consistent with earlier work and also neural networks in
general. With this extended design, the classifier can now achieve the high
levels of accuracy reported previously.
