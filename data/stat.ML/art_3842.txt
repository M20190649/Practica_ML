Classical Statistics and Statistical Learning in Imaging Neuroscience
Neuroimaging research has predominantly drawn conclusions based on classical
statistics, including null-hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVA. Throughout
recent years, statistical learning methods enjoy increasing popularity,
including cross-validation, pattern classification, and sparsity-inducing
regression. These two methodological families used for neuroimaging data
analysis can be viewed as two extremes of a continuum. Yet, they originated
from different historical contexts, build on different theories, rest on
different assumptions, evaluate different outcome metrics, and permit different
conclusions. This paper portrays commonalities and differences between
classical statistics and statistical learning with their relation to
neuroimaging research. The conceptual implications are illustrated in three
common analysis scenarios. It is thus tried to resolve possible confusion
between classical hypothesis testing and data-guided model estimation by
discussing their ramifications for the neuroimaging access to neurobiology.
