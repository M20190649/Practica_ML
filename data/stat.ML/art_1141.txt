Smoothing Effects of Bagging: Von Mises Expansions of Bagged Statistical
  Functionals
Bagging is a device intended for reducing the prediction error of learning
algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the
training sample, applies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and
then averages the resulting prediction rules.
  We extend the definition of bagging from statistics to statistical
functionals and study the von Mises expansion of bagged statistical
functionals. We show that the expansion is related to the Efron-Stein ANOVA
expansion of the raw (unbagged) functional. The basic observation is that a
bagged functional is always smooth in the sense that the von Mises expansion
exists and is finite of length 1 + resample size $M$. This holds even if the
raw functional is rough or unstable. The resample size $M$ acts as a smoothing
parameter, where a smaller $M$ means more smoothing.
