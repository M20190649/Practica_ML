Region Detection in Markov Random Fields: Gaussian Case
We consider the problem of model selection in Gaussian Markov fields in the
sample deficient scenario. The benchmark information-theoretic results in the
case of d-regular graphs require the number of samples to be at least
proportional to the logarithm of the number of vertices to allow consistent
graph recovery. When the number of samples is less than this amount, reliable
detection of all edges is impossible. In many applications, it is more
important to learn the distribution of the edge (coupling) parameters over the
network than the specific locations of the edges. Assuming that the entire
graph can be partitioned into a number of spatial regions with similar edge
parameters and reasonably regular boundaries, we develop new
information-theoretic sample complexity bounds and show that a bounded number
of samples can be sufficient to consistently recover these regions. Finally, we
introduce and analyze an efficient region growing algorithm capable of
recovering the regions with high accuracy. We show that it is consistent and
demonstrate its performance benefits in synthetic simulations.
