Application of Support Vector Machine Modeling and Graph Theory Metrics
  for Disease Classification
Disease classification is a crucial element of biomedical research. Recent
studies have demonstrated that machine learning techniques, such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) modeling, produce similar or improved predictive
capabilities in comparison to the traditional method of Logistic Regression. In
addition, it has been found that social network metrics can provide useful
predictive information for disease modeling. In this study, we combine
simulated social network metrics with SVM to predict diabetes in a sample of
data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In this dataset,
Logistic Regression outperformed SVM with ROC index of 81.8 and 81.7 for models
with and without graph metrics, respectively. SVM with a polynomial kernel had
ROC index of 72.9 and 75.6 for models with and without graph metrics,
respectively. Although this did not perform as well as Logistic Regression, the
results are consistent with previous studies utilizing SVM to classify
diabetes.
