Sparse Linear Isotonic Models
In machine learning and data mining, linear models have been widely used to
model the response as parametric linear functions of the predictors. To relax
such stringent assumptions made by parametric linear models, additive models
consider the response to be a summation of unknown transformations applied on
the predictors; in particular, additive isotonic models (AIMs) assume the
unknown transformations to be monotone. In this paper, we introduce sparse
linear isotonic models (SLIMs) for highdimensional problems by hybridizing
ideas in parametric sparse linear models and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing
advantages over both. In the high-dimensional setting, a two-step algorithm is
proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as well as the monotone functions
over predictors. Under mild statistical assumptions, we show that the algorithm
can accurately estimate the parameters. Promising preliminary experiments are
presented to support the theoretical results.
