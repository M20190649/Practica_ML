Multi-view Regularized Gaussian Processes
Gaussian processes (GPs) have been proven to be powerful tools in various
areas of machine learning. However, there are very few applications of GPs in
the scenario of multi-view learning. In this paper, we present a new GP model
for multi-view learning. Unlike existing methods, it combines multiple views by
regularizing marginal likelihood with the consistency among the posterior
distributions of latent functions from different views. Moreover, we give a
general point selection scheme for multi-view learning and improve the proposed
model by this criterion. Experimental results on multiple real world data sets
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and witnessed the
performance improvement through employing this novel point selection scheme.
