The Knowledge Gradient with Logistic Belief Models for Binary
  Classification
We consider sequential decision making problems for binary classification
scenario in which the learner takes an active role in repeatedly selecting
samples from the action pool and receives the binary label of the selected
alternatives. Our problem is motivated by applications where observations are
time consuming and/or expensive, resulting in small samples. The goal is to
identify the best alternative with the highest response. We use Bayesian
logistic regression to predict the response of each alternative. By formulating
the problem as a Markov decision process, we develop a knowledge-gradient type
policy to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information
of labeling each alternative and provide a finite-time analysis on the
estimated error. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.
