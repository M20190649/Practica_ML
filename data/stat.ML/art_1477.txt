High-dimensional robust regression and outliers detection with SLOPE
The problems of outliers detection and robust regression in a
high-dimensional setting are fundamental in statistics, and have numerous
applications. Following a recent set of works providing methods for
simultaneous robust regression and outliers detection, we consider in this
paper a model of linear regression with individual intercepts, in a
high-dimensional setting. We introduce a new procedure for simultaneous
estimation of the linear regression coefficients and intercepts, using two
dedicated sorted-$\ell_1$ penalizations, also called SLOPE. We develop a
complete theory for this problem: first, we provide sharp upper bounds on the
statistical estimation error of both the vector of individual intercepts and
regression coefficients. Second, we give an asymptotic control on the False
Discovery Rate (FDR) and statistical power for support selection of the
individual intercepts. As a consequence, this paper is the first to introduce a
procedure with guaranteed FDR and statistical power control for outliers
detection under the mean-shift model. Numerical illustrations, with a
comparison to recent alternative approaches, are provided on both simulated and
several real-world datasets. Experiments are conducted using an open-source
software written in Python and C++.
