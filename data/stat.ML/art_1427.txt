Reconstruction from Periodic Nonlinearities, With Applications to HDR
  Imaging
We consider the problem of reconstructing signals and images from periodic
nonlinearities. For such problems, we design a measurement scheme that supports
efficient reconstruction; moreover, our method can be adapted to extend to
compressive sensing-based signal and image acquisition systems. Our techniques
can be potentially useful for reducing the measurement complexity of high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging systems, with little loss in reconstruction
quality. Several numerical experiments on real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.
