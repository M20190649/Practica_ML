Constructive sparse trigonometric approximation for functions with small
  mixed smoothness
The paper gives a constructive method, based on greedy algorithms, that
provides for the classes of functions with small mixed smoothness the best
possible in the sense of order approximation error for the $m$-term
approximation with respect to the trigonometric system.
