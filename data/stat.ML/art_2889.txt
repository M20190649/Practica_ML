Personalized Medical Treatments Using Novel Reinforcement Learning
  Algorithms
In both the fields of computer science and medicine there is very strong
interest in developing personalized treatment policies for patients who have
variable responses to treatments. In particular, I aim to find an optimal
personalized treatment policy which is a non-deterministic function of the
patient specific covariate data that maximizes the expected survival time or
clinical outcome. I developed an algorithmic framework to solve multistage
decision problem with a varying number of stages that are subject to censoring
in which the "rewards" are expected survival times. In specific, I developed a
novel Q-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts for these parameters.
Furthermore, I found finite upper bounds on the generalized error of the
treatment paths constructed by this algorithm. I have also shown that when the
optimal Q-function is an element of the approximation space, the anticipated
survival times for the treatment regime constructed by the algorithm will
converge to the optimal treatment path. I demonstrated the performance of the
proposed algorithmic framework via simulation studies and through the analysis
of chronic depression data and a hypothetical clinical trial. The censored
Q-learning algorithm I developed is more effective than the state of the art
clinical decision support systems and is able to operate in environments when
many covariate parameters may be unobtainable or censored.
