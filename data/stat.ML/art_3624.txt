Bayesian Inference in Cumulative Distribution Fields
One approach for constructing copula functions is by multiplication. Given
that products of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are also CDFs, an
adjustment to this multiplication will result in a copula model, as discussed
by Liebscher (J Mult Analysis, 2008). Parameterizing models via products of
CDFs has some advantages, both from the copula perspective (e.g., it is
well-defined for any dimensionality) and from general multivariate analysis
(e.g., it provides models where small dimensional marginal distributions can be
easily read-off from the parameters). Independently, Huang and Frey (J Mach
Learn Res, 2011) showed the connection between certain sparse graphical models
and products of CDFs, as well as message-passing (dynamic programming) schemes
for computing the likelihood function of such models. Such schemes allows
models to be estimated with likelihood-based methods. We discuss and
demonstrate MCMC approaches for estimating such models in a Bayesian context,
their application in copula modeling, and how message-passing can be strongly
simplified. Importantly, our view of message-passing opens up possibilities to
scaling up such methods, given that even dynamic programming is not a scalable
solution for calculating likelihood functions in many models.
