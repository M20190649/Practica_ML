Parallel Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Matrix
  Factorisation Models
For large matrix factorisation problems, we develop a distributed Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD) that we call Parallel SGLD (PSGLD). PSGLD has very favourable scaling
properties with increasing data size and is comparable in terms of
computational requirements to optimisation methods based on stochastic gradient
descent. PSGLD achieves high performance by exploiting the conditional
independence structure of the MF models to sub-sample data in a systematic
manner as to allow parallelisation and distributed computation. We provide a
convergence proof of the algorithm and verify its superior performance on
various architectures such as Graphics Processing Units, shared memory
multi-core systems and multi-computer clusters.
