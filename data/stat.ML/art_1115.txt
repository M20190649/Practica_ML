Formal Concept Analysis of Rodent Carriers of Zoonotic Disease
The technique of Formal Concept Analysis is applied to a dataset describing
the traits of rodents, with the goal of identifying zoonotic disease
carriers,or those species carrying infections that can spillover to cause human
disease. The concepts identified among these species together provide
rules-of-thumb about the intrinsic biological features of rodents that carry
zoonotic diseases, and offer utility for better targeting field surveillance
efforts in the search for novel disease carriers in the wild.
