Learning Gaussian Graphical Models Using Discriminated Hub Graphical
  Lasso
We develop a new method called Discriminated Hub Graphical Lasso (DHGL) based
on Hub Graphical Lasso (HGL) by providing prior information of hubs. We apply
this new method in two situations: with known hubs and without known hubs. Then
we compare DHGL with HGL using several measures of performance. When some hubs
are known, we can always estimate the precision matrix better via DHGL than
HGL. When no hubs are known, we use Graphical Lasso (GL) to provide information
of hubs and find that the performance of DHGL will always be better than HGL if
correct prior information is given and will seldom degenerate when the prior
information is wrong.
