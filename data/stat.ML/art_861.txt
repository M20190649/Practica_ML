Variational Fourier features for Gaussian processes
This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the
variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of
Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the
benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and
computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key
result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the
Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these
expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more
dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of
additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the
dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4
million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With
non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from
O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the
number of data and M is the number of features.
