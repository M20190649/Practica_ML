On the construction of probabilistic Newton-type algorithms
It has recently been shown that many of the existing quasi-Newton algorithms
can be formulated as learning algorithms, capable of learning local models of
the cost functions. Importantly, this understanding allows us to safely start
assembling probabilistic Newton-type algorithms, applicable in situations where
we only have access to noisy observations of the cost function and its
derivatives. This is where our interest lies.
  We make contributions to the use of the non-parametric and probabilistic
Gaussian process models in solving these stochastic optimisation problems.
Specifically, we present a new algorithm that unites these approximations
together with recent probabilistic line search routines to deliver a
probabilistic quasi-Newton approach.
  We also show that the probabilistic optimisation algorithms deliver promising
results on challenging nonlinear system identification problems where the very
nature of the problem is such that we can only access the cost function and its
derivative via noisy observations, since there are no closed-form expressions
available.
