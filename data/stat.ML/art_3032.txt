Hierarchical models for neural population dynamics in the presence of
  non-stationarity
Neural population activity often exhibits rich variability and temporal
structure. This variability is thought to arise from single-neuron
stochasticity, neural dynamics on short time-scales, as well as from
modulations of neural firing properties on long time-scales, often referred to
as "non-stationarity". To better understand the nature of co-variability in
neural circuits and their impact on cortical information processing, we need
statistical models that are able to capture multiple sources of variability on
different time-scales. Here, we introduce a hierarchical statistical model of
neural population activity which models both neural population dynamics as well
as inter-trial modulations in firing rates. In addition, we extend the model to
allow us to capture non-stationarities in the population dynamics itself (i.e.,
correlations across neurons).
  We develop variational inference methods for learning model parameters, and
demonstrate that the method can recover non-stationarities in both average
firing rates and correlation structure. Applied to neural population recordings
from anesthetized macaque primary visual cortex, our models provide a better
account of the structure of neural firing than stationary dynamics models.
