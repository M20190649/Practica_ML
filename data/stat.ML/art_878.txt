Improving Variational Auto-Encoders using convex combination linear
  Inverse Autoregressive Flow
In this paper, we propose a new volume-preserving flow and show that it
performs similarly to the linear general normalizing flow. The idea is to
enrich a linear Inverse Autoregressive Flow by introducing multiple
lower-triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal and combining them using a
convex combination. In the experimental studies on MNIST and Histopathology
data we show that the proposed approach outperforms other volume-preserving
flows and is competitive with current state-of-the-art linear normalizing flow.
