Minimax Policies for Combinatorial Prediction Games
We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the
forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the
magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study
the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full
information, and the partial information models of the so-called "semi-bandit",
and "bandit" problems. We consider both $L_\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of
restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary.
  We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a
potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the
series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al.
(2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et
al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck
(2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We
propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower
bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the
bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor.
Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the
exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\infty}$
adversaries.
