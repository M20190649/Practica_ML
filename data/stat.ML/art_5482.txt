A comparative study of counterfactual estimators
We provide a comparative study of several widely used off-policy estimators
(Empirical Average, Basic Importance Sampling and Normalized Importance
Sampling), detailing the different regimes where they are individually
suboptimal. We then exhibit properties optimal estimators should possess. In
the case where examples have been gathered using multiple policies, we show
that fused estimators dominate basic ones but can still be improved.
