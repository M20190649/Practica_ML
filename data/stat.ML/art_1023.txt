Mean Absolute Percentage Error for regression models
We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We prove the
existence of an optimal MAPE model and we show the universal consistency of
Empirical Risk Minimization based on the MAPE. We also show that finding the
best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) regression, and we apply this weighting strategy to kernel regression.
The behavior of the MAPE kernel regression is illustrated on simulated data.
