Structural Agnostic Modeling: Adversarial Learning of Causal Graphs
A new causal discovery method, Structural Agnostic Modeling (SAM), is
presented in this paper. Leveraging both conditional independencies and
distributional asymmetries in the data, SAM aims at recovering full causal
models from continuous observational data along a multivariate non-parametric
setting. The approach is based on a game between $d$ players estimating each
variable distribution conditionally to the others as a neural net, and an
adversary aimed at discriminating the overall joint conditional distribution,
and that of the original data. An original learning criterion combining
distribution estimation, sparsity and acyclicity constraints is used to enforce
the end-to-end optimization of the graph structure and parameters through
stochastic gradient descent. Besides the theoretical analysis of the approach
in the large sample limit, SAM is extensively experimentally validated on
synthetic and real data.
