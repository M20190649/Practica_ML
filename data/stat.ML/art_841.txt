Super-resolution estimation of cyclic arrival rates
Exploiting the fact that most arrival processes exhibit cyclic behaviour, we
propose a simple procedure for estimating the intensity of a nonhomogeneous
Poisson process. The estimator is the super-resolution analogue to Shao 2010
and Shao & Lii 2011, which is a sum of $p$ sinusoids where $p$ and the
frequency, amplitude, and phase of each wave are not known and need to be
estimated. This results in an interpretable yet flexible specification that is
suitable for use in modelling as well as in high resolution simulations.
  Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and
atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window
functions in the point process domain, our approach attains super-resolution
without semidefinite programming. Under suitable conditions, finite sample
guarantees can be derived for our procedure. These resolve some open questions
and expand existing results in spectral estimation literature.
