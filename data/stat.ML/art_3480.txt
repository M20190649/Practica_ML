Smooth Alternating Direction Methods for Nonsmooth Constrained Convex
  Optimization
We propose two new alternating direction methods to solve "fully" nonsmooth
constrained convex problems. Our algorithms have the best known worst-case
iteration-complexity guarantee under mild assumptions for both the objective
residual and feasibility gap. Through theoretical analysis, we show how to
update all the algorithmic parameters automatically with clear impact on the
convergence performance. We also provide a representative numerical example
showing the advantages of our methods over the classical alternating direction
methods using a well-known feasibility problem.
