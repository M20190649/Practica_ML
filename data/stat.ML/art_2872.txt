Formal Hypothesis Tests for Additive Structure in Random Forests
While statistical learning methods have proved powerful tools for predictive
modeling, the black-box nature of the models they produce can severely limit
their interpretability and the ability to conduct formal inference. However,
the natural structure of ensemble learners like bagged trees and random forests
has been shown to admit desirable asymptotic properties when base learners are
built with proper subsamples. In this work, we demonstrate that by defining an
appropriate grid structure on the covariate space, we may carry out formal
hypothesis tests for both variable importance and underlying additive model
structure. To our knowledge, these tests represent the first statistical tools
for investigating the underlying regression structure in a context such as
random forests. We develop notions of total and partial additivity and further
demonstrate that testing can be carried out at no additional computational cost
by estimating the variance within the process of constructing the ensemble.
Furthermore, we propose a novel extension of these testing procedures utilizing
random projections in order to allow for computationally efficient testing
procedures that retain high power even when the grid size is much larger than
that of the training set.
