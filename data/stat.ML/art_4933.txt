Depth and depth-based classification with R-package ddalpha
Following the seminal idea of Tukey, data depth is a function that measures
how close an arbitrary point of the space is located to an implicitly defined
center of a data cloud. Having undergone theoretical and computational
developments, it is now employed in numerous applications with classification
being the most popular one. The R-package ddalpha is a software directed to
fuse experience of the applicant with recent achievements in the area of data
depth and depth-based classification.
  ddalpha provides an implementation for exact and approximate computation of
most reasonable and widely applied notions of data depth. These can be further
used in the depth-based multivariate and functional classifiers implemented in
the package, where the $DD\alpha$-procedure is in the main focus. The package
is expandable with user-defined custom depth methods and separators. The
implemented functions for depth visualization and the built-in benchmark
procedures may also serve to provide insights into the geometry of the data and
the quality of pattern recognition.
