Non-Parametric Cluster Significance Testing with Reference to a Unimodal
  Null Distribution
Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning strategy that can be employed to
identify subgroups of observations in data sets of unknown structure. This
strategy is particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data such as
microarray gene expression data. Many clustering methods are available, but it
is challenging to determine if the identified clusters represent distinct
subgroups. We propose a novel strategy to investigate the significance of
identified clusters by comparing the within- cluster sum of squares from the
original data to that produced by clustering an appropriate unimodal null
distribution. The null distribution we present for this problem uses kernel
density estimation and thus does not require that the data follow any
particular distribution. We find that our method can accurately test for the
presence of clustering even when the number of features is high.
