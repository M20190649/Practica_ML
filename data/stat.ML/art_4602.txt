Hankel Matrix Nuclear Norm Regularized Tensor Completion for
  $N$-dimensional Exponential Signals
Signals are generally modeled as a superposition of exponential functions in
spectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. For fast data
acquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, only a small amount of
samples may be acquired and thus how to recover the full signal becomes an
active research topic. But existing approaches can not efficiently recover
$N$-dimensional exponential signals with $N\geq 3$. In this paper, we study the
problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly $N\geq 3$) exponential
signals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank
tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is
reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC structure and
the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is
promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of
Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance
spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full
signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.
