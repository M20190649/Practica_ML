Group-sparse block PCA and explained variance
The paper addresses the simultneous determination of goup-sparse loadings by
block optimization, and the correlated problem of defining explained variance
for a set of non orthogonal components. We give in both cases a comprehensive
mathematical presentation of the problem, which leads to propose i) a new
formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the
definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The
numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over
deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of
group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms
according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of
explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the
definition of choice for explained variance.
