Regression Phalanxes
Tomal et al. (2015) introduced the notion of "phalanxes" in the context of
rare-class detection in two-class classification problems. A phalanx is a
subset of features that work well for classification tasks. In this paper, we
propose a different class of phalanxes for application in regression settings.
We define a "Regression Phalanx" - a subset of features that work well together
for prediction. We propose a novel algorithm which automatically chooses
Regression Phalanxes from high-dimensional data sets using hierarchical
clustering and builds a prediction model for each phalanx for further
ensembling. Through extensive simulation studies and several real-life
applications in various areas (including drug discovery, chemical analysis of
spectra data, microarray analysis and climate projections) we show that an
ensemble of Regression Phalanxes improves prediction accuracy when combined
with effective prediction methods like Lasso or Random Forests.
