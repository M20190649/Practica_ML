Order-preserving factor analysis (OPFA)
We present a novel factor analysis method that can be applied to the
discovery of common factors shared among trajectories in multivariate time
series data. These factors satisfy a precedence-ordering property: certain
factors are recruited only after some other factors are activated.
Precedence-ordering arise in applications where variables are activated in a
specific order, which is unknown. The proposed method is based on a linear
model that accounts for each factor's inherent delays and relative order. We
present an algorithm to fit the model in an unsupervised manner using
techniques from convex and non-convex optimization that enforce sparsity of the
factor scores and consistent precedence-order of the factor loadings. We
illustrate the Order-Preserving Factor Analysis (OPFA) method for the problem
of extracting precedence-ordered factors from a longitudinal (time course)
study of gene expression data.
