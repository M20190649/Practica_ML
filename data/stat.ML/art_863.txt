Time Series Structure Discovery via Probabilistic Program Synthesis
There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from
time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian
Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single
time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is
generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of
temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice.
This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic
program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using
abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii)
represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using
probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final
probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in
Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that
involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and
extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over
both non-parametric and standard regression baselines.
