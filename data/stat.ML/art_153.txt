Online algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the
  Itakura-Saito divergence
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source
separation. When learning NMF on large audio databases, one major drawback is
that the complexity in time is O(FKN) when updating the dictionary (where (F;N)
is the dimension of the input power spectrograms, and K the number of basis
spectra), thus forbidding its application on signals longer than an hour. We
provide an online algorithm with a complexity of O(FK) in time and memory for
updates in the dictionary. We show on audio simulations that the online
approach is faster for short audio signals and allows to analyze audio signals
of several hours.
