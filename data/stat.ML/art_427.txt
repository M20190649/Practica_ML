LOCO: Distributing Ridge Regression with Random Projections
We propose LOCO, an algorithm for large-scale ridge regression which
distributes the features across workers on a cluster. Important dependencies
between variables are preserved using structured random projections which are
cheap to compute and must only be communicated once. We show that LOCO obtains
a solution which is close to the exact ridge regression solution in the fixed
design setting. We verify this experimentally in a simulation study as well as
an application to climate prediction. Furthermore, we show that LOCO achieves
significant speedups compared with a state-of-the-art distributed algorithm on
a large-scale regression problem.
