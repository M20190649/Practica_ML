Accelerated Inference for Latent Variable Models
Inference of latent feature models in the Bayesian nonparametric setting is
generally difficult, especially in high dimensional settings, because it
usually requires proposing features from some prior distribution. In special
cases, where the integration is tractable, we could sample new feature
assignments according to a predictive likelihood. However, this still may not
be efficient in high dimensions. We present a novel method to accelerate the
mixing of latent variable model inference by proposing feature locations from
the data, as opposed to the prior. First, we introduce our accelerated feature
proposal mechanism that we will show is a valid Bayesian inference algorithm
and next we propose an approximate inference strategy to perform accelerated
inference in parallel. This sampling method is efficient for proper mixing of
the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, computationally attractive, and is
theoretically guaranteed to converge to the posterior distribution as its
limiting distribution.
