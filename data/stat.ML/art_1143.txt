A New Spectral Method for Latent Variable Models
This paper presents an algorithm for the unsupervised learning of latent
variable models from unlabeled sets of data. We base our technique on spectral
decomposition, providing a technique that proves to be robust both in theory
and in practice. We also describe how to use this algorithm to learn the
parameters of two well known text mining models: single topic model and Latent
Dirichlet Allocation, providing in both cases an efficient technique to
retrieve the parameters to feed the algorithm. We compare the results of our
algorithm with those of existing algorithms on synthetic data, and we provide
examples of applications to real world text corpora for both single topic model
and LDA, obtaining meaningful results.
