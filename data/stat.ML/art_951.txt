Faster ICA under orthogonal constraint
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique for unsupervised
exploration of multi-channel data widely used in observational sciences. In its
classical form, ICA relies on modeling the data as a linear mixture of
non-Gaussian independent sources. The problem can be seen as a likelihood
maximization problem. We introduce Picard-O, a preconditioned L-BFGS strategy
over the set of orthogonal matrices, which can quickly separate both super- and
sub-Gaussian signals. It returns the same set of sources as the widely used
FastICA algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method is
faster and more robust than FastICA on real data.
