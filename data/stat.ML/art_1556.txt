Application of RÃ©nyi and Tsallis Entropies to Topic Modeling
  Optimization
This is full length article (draft version) where problem number of topics in
Topic Modeling is discussed. We proposed idea that Renyi and Tsallis entropy
can be used for identification of optimal number in large textual collections.
We also report results of numerical experiments of Semantic stability for 4
topic models, which shows that semantic stability play very important role in
problem topic number. The calculation of Renyi and Tsallis entropy based on
thermodynamics approach.
