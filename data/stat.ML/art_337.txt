Convergence analysis of kernel LMS algorithm with pre-tuned dictionary
The kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm is an appealing tool for online
identification of nonlinear systems due to its simplicity and robustness. In
addition to choosing a reproducing kernel and setting filter parameters,
designing a KLMS adaptive filter requires to select a so-called dictionary in
order to get a finite-order model. This dictionary has a significant impact on
performance, and requires careful consideration. Theoretical analysis of KLMS
as a function of dictionary setting has rarely, if ever, been addressed in the
literature. In an analysis previously published by the authors, the dictionary
elements were assumed to be governed by the same probability density function
of the input data. In this paper, we modify this study by considering the
dictionary as part of the filter parameters to be set. This theoretical
analysis paves the way for future investigations on KLMS dictionary design.
