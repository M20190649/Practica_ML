One-Trial Correction of Legacy AI Systems and Stochastic Separation
  Theorems
We consider the problem of efficient "on the fly" tuning of existing, or {\it
legacy}, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The legacy AI systems are
allowed to be of arbitrary class, albeit the data they are using for computing
interim or final decision responses should posses an underlying structure of a
high-dimensional topological real vector space. The tuning method that we
propose enables dealing with errors without the need to re-train the system.
Instead of re-training a simple cascade of perceptron nodes is added to the
legacy system. The added cascade modulates the AI legacy system's decisions. If
applied repeatedly, the process results in a network of modulating rules
"dressing up" and improving performance of existing AI systems. Mathematical
rationale behind the method is based on the fundamental property of measure
concentration in high dimensional spaces. The method is illustrated with an
example of fine-tuning a deep convolutional network that has been pre-trained
to detect pedestrians in images.
