Infinite Mixture Model of Markov Chains
We propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for prediction- and
information extraction tasks with an efficient inference scheme. It models
categorical-valued time series that exhibit dynamics from multiple underlying
patterns (e.g. user behavior traces). We simplify the idea of capturing these
patterns by hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs) - and extend the existing
approaches by the additional representation of structural information. Our
empirical results are based on both synthetic- and real world data. They
indicate that the results are easily interpretable, and that the model excels
at segmentation and prediction performance: it successfully identifies the
generating patterns and can be used for effective prediction of future
observations.
