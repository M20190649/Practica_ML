Classical vs. Bayesian methods for linear system identification: point
  estimators and confidence sets
This paper compares classical parametric methods with recently developed
Bayesian methods for system identification. A Full Bayes solution is considered
together with one of the standard approximations based on the Empirical Bayes
paradigm. Results regarding point estimators for the impulse response as well
as for confidence regions are reported.
