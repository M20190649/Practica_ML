Tick: a Python library for statistical learning, with a particular
  emphasis on time-dependent modelling
Tick is a statistical learning library for Python~3, with a particular
emphasis on time-dependent models, such as point processes, and tools for
generalized linear models and survival analysis. The core of the library is an
optimization module providing model computational classes, solvers and proximal
operators for regularization. tick relies on a C++ implementation and
state-of-the-art optimization algorithms to provide very fast computations in a
single node multi-core setting. Source code and documentation can be downloaded
