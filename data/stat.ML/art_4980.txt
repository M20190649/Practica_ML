A Tutorial on Online Supervised Learning with Applications to Node
  Classification in Social Networks
We revisit the elegant observation of T. Cover '65 which, perhaps, is not as
well-known to the broader community as it should be. The first goal of the
tutorial is to explain---through the prism of this elementary result---how to
solve certain sequence prediction problems by modeling sets of solutions rather
than the unknown data-generating mechanism. We extend Cover's observation in
several directions and focus on computational aspects of the proposed
algorithms. The applicability of the methods is illustrated on several
examples, including node classification in a network.
  The second aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate the following phenomenon:
it is possible to predict as well as a combinatorial "benchmark" for which we
have a certain multiplicative approximation algorithm, even if the exact
computation of the benchmark given all the data is NP-hard. The proposed
prediction methods, therefore, circumvent some of the computational
difficulties associated with finding the best model given the data. These
difficulties arise rather quickly when one attempts to develop a probabilistic
model for graph-based or other problems with a combinatorial structure.
