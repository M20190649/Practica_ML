Using Machine Learning to Predict the Outcome of English County twenty
  over Cricket Matches
Cricket betting is a multi-billion dollar market. Therefore, there is a
strong incentive for models that can predict the outcomes of games and beat the
odds provided by bookers. The aim of this study was to investigate to what
degree it is possible to predict the outcome of cricket matches. The target
competition was the English twenty over county cricket cup. The original
features alongside engineered features gave rise to more than 500 team and
player statistics. The models were optimized firstly with team features only
and then both team and player features. The performance of the models was
tested over individual seasons from 2009 to 2014 having been trained over
previous season data in each case. The optimal model was a simple prediction
method combined with complex hierarchical features and was shown to
significantly outperform a gambling industry benchmark.
