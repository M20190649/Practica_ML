A Simple Approach to Sparse Clustering
Consider the problem of sparse clustering, where it is assumed that only a
subset of the features are useful for clustering purposes. In the framework of
the COSA method of Friedman and Meulman, subsequently improved in the form of
the Sparse K-means method of Witten and Tibshirani, a natural and simpler
hill-climbing approach is introduced. The new method is shown to be competitive
with these two methods and others.
