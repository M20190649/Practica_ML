Dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for Abnormal Behaviour Detection
  in Video
This paper proposes a novel dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process topic
model that considers the dependence between successive observations.
Conventional posterior inference algorithms for this kind of models require
processing of the whole data through several passes. It is computationally
intractable for massive or sequential data. We design the batch and online
inference algorithms, based on the Gibbs sampling, for the proposed model. It
allows to process sequential data, incrementally updating the model by a new
observation. The model is applied to abnormal behaviour detection in video
sequences. A new abnormality measure is proposed for decision making. The
proposed method is compared with the method based on the non- dynamic
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for which we also derive the online Gibbs
sampler and the abnormality measure. The results with synthetic and real data
show that the consideration of the dynamics in a topic model improves the
classification performance for abnormal behaviour detection.
