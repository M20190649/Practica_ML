Regression shrinkage and grouping of highly correlated predictors with
  HORSES
Identifying homogeneous subgroups of variables can be challenging in high
dimensional data analysis with highly correlated predictors. We propose a new
method called Hexagonal Operator for Regression with Shrinkage and Equality
Selection, HORSES for short, that simultaneously selects positively correlated
variables and identifies them as predictive clusters. This is achieved via a
constrained least-squares problem with regularization that consists of a linear
combination of an L_1 penalty for the coefficients and another L_1 penalty for
pairwise differences of the coefficients. This specification of the penalty
function encourages grouping of positively correlated predictors combined with
a sparsity solution. We construct an efficient algorithm to implement the
HORSES procedure. We show via simulation that the proposed method outperforms
other variable selection methods in terms of prediction error and parsimony.
The technique is demonstrated on two data sets, a small data set from analysis
of soil in Appalachia, and a high dimensional data set from a near infrared
(NIR) spectroscopy study, showing the flexibility of the methodology.
