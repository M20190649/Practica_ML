Massive Data Clustering in Moderate Dimensions from the Dual Spaces of
  Observation and Attribute Data Clouds
Cluster analysis of very high dimensional data can benefit from the
properties of such high dimensionality. Informally expressed, in this work, our
focus is on the analogous situation when the dimensionality is moderate to
small, relative to a massively sized set of observations. Mathematically
expressed, these are the dual spaces of observations and attributes. The point
cloud of observations is in attribute space, and the point cloud of attributes
is in observation space. In this paper, we begin by summarizing various
perspectives related to methodologies that are used in multivariate analytics.
We draw on these to establish an efficient clustering processing pipeline, both
partitioning and hierarchical clustering.
