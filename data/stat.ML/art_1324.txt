ReFACTor: Practical Low-Rank Matrix Estimation Under Column-Sparsity
Various problems in data analysis and statistical genetics call for recovery
of a column-sparse, low-rank matrix from noisy observations. We propose
ReFACTor, a simple variation of the classical Truncated Singular Value
Decomposition (TSVD) algorithm. In contrast to previous sparse principal
component analysis (PCA) algorithms, our algorithm can provably reveal a
low-rank signal matrix better, and often significantly better, than the widely
used TSVD, making it the algorithm of choice whenever column-sparsity is
suspected. Empirically, we observe that ReFACTor consistently outperforms TSVD
even when the underlying signal is not sparse, suggesting that it is generally
safe to use ReFACTor instead of TSVD and PCA. The algorithm is extremely simple
to implement and its running time is dominated by the runtime of PCA, making it
as practical as standard principal component analysis.
