Robustness of Maximum Correntropy Estimation Against Large Outliers
The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully
applied in robust regression, classification and adaptive filtering, where the
correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the well-known mean square error
(MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers (or impulsive noises).
Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop various robust adaptive
algorithms under MCC, but so far little insight has been gained as to how the
optimal solution will be affected by outliers. In this work, we study this
problem in the context of parameter estimation for a simple linear
errors-in-variables (EIV) model where all variables are scalar. Under certain
conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation
error and show that the optimal solution under MCC can be very close to the
true value of the unknown parameter even with outliers (whose values can be
arbitrarily large) in both input and output variables. Illustrative examples
are presented to verify and clarify the theory.
