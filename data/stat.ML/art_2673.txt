Particle Metropolis-Hastings using gradient and Hessian information
Particle Metropolis-Hastings (PMH) allows for Bayesian parameter inference in
nonlinear state space models by combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
particle filtering. The latter is used to estimate the intractable likelihood.
In its original formulation, PMH makes use of a marginal MCMC proposal for the
parameters, typically a Gaussian random walk. However, this can lead to a poor
exploration of the parameter space and an inefficient use of the generated
particles.
  We propose a number of alternative versions of PMH that incorporate gradient
and Hessian information about the posterior into the proposal. This information
is more or less obtained as a byproduct of the likelihood estimation. Indeed,
we show how to estimate the required information using a fixed-lag particle
smoother, with a computational cost growing linearly in the number of
particles. We conclude that the proposed methods can: (i) decrease the length
of the burn-in phase, (ii) increase the mixing of the Markov chain at the
stationary phase, and (iii) make the proposal distribution scale invariant
which simplifies tuning.
