Fast Landmark Subspace Clustering
Kernel methods obtain superb performance in terms of accuracy for various
machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations.
However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering
tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily
approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in
particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering
and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from
$K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an
algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the
original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of
this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering
algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal
sacrifice of accuracy.
