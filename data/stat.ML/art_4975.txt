Machine Learning in Downlink Coordinated Multipoint in Heterogeneous
  Networks
We propose a method for downlink coordinated multipoint (DL CoMP) in
heterogeneous fifth generation New Radio (NR) networks. The primary
contribution of our paper is an algorithm to enhance the trigger of DL CoMP
using online machine learning. We use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers
to enhance the user downlink throughput in a realistic frequency division
duplex network environment. Our simulation results show improvement in both the
macro and pico base station downlink throughputs due to the informed triggering
of the multiple radio streams as learned by the SVM classifier.
