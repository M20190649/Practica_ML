Efficient Distributed Estimation of Inverse Covariance Matrices
In distributed systems, communication is a major concern due to issues such
as its vulnerability or efficiency. In this paper, we are interested in
estimating sparse inverse covariance matrices when samples are distributed into
different machines. We address communication efficiency by proposing a method
where, in a single round of communication, each machine transfers a small
subset of the entries of the inverse covariance matrix. We show that, with this
efficient distributed method, the error rates can be comparable with estimation
in a non-distributed setting, and correct model selection is still possible.
Practical performance is shown through simulations.
