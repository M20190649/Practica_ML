Ensembles of phalanxes across assessment metrics for robust ranking of
  homologous proteins
Two proteins are homologous if they have a common evolutionary origin, and
the binary classification problem is to identify proteins in a candidate set
that are homologous to a particular native protein. The feature (explanatory)
variables available for classification are various measures of similarity of
proteins. There are multiple classification problems of this type for different
native proteins and their respective candidate sets. Homologous proteins are
rare in a single candidate set, giving a highly unbalanced two-class problem.
The goal is to rank proteins in a candidate set according to the probability of
being homologous to the set's native protein. An ideal classifier will place
all the homologous proteins at the head of such a list. Our approach uses an
ensemble of models in a classifier and an ensemble of assessment metrics. For a
given metric a classifier combines models, each based on a subset of the
available feature variables which we call phalanxes. The proposed ensemble of
phalanxes identifies strong and diverse subsets of feature variables. A second
phase of ensembling aggregates classifiers based on diverse evaluation metrics.
The overall result is called an ensemble of phalanxes and metrics. It provide
robustness against both close and distant homologues.
