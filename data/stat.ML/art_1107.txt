Statistical Guarantees for Estimating the Centers of a Two-component
  Gaussian Mixture by EM
Recently, a general method for analyzing the statistical accuracy of the EM
algorithm has been developed and applied to some simple latent variable models
[Balakrishnan et al. 2016]. In that method, the basin of attraction for valid
initialization is required to be a ball around the truth. Using Stein's Lemma,
we extend these results in the case of estimating the centers of a
two-component Gaussian mixture in $d$ dimensions. In particular, we
significantly expand the basin of attraction to be the intersection of a half
space and a ball around the origin. If the signal-to-noise ratio is at least a
constant multiple of $ \sqrt{d\log d} $, we show that a random initialization
strategy is feasible.
