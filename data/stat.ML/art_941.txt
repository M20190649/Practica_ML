Causal nearest neighbor rules for optimal treatment regimes
The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to
precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor
method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the
framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects
within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses
nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size
increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal
$k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e.
performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this
problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform
metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the
proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a
chronic depression clinical trial.
