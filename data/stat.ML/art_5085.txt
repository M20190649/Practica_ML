Deep learning in color: towards automated quark/gluon jet discrimination
Artificial intelligence offers the potential to automate challenging
data-processing tasks in collider physics. To establish its prospects, we
explore to what extent deep learning with convolutional neural networks can
discriminate quark and gluon jets better than observables designed by
physicists. Our approach builds upon the paradigm that a jet can be treated as
an image, with intensity given by the local calorimeter deposits. We supplement
this construction by adding color to the images, with red, green and blue
intensities given by the transverse momentum in charged particles, transverse
momentum in neutral particles, and pixel-level charged particle counts.
Overall, the deep networks match or outperform traditional jet variables. We
also find that, while various simulations produce different quark and gluon
jets, the neural networks are surprisingly insensitive to these differences,
similar to traditional observables. This suggests that the networks can extract
robust physical information from imperfect simulations.
