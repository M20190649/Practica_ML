Multiple Testing for Neuroimaging via Hidden Markov Random Field
Traditional voxel-level multiple testing procedures in neuroimaging, mostly
$p$-value based, often ignore the spatial correlations among neighboring voxels
and thus suffer from substantial loss of power. We extend the
local-significance-index based procedure originally developed for the hidden
Markov chain models, which aims to minimize the false nondiscovery rate subject
to a constraint on the false discovery rate, to three-dimensional neuroimaging
data using a hidden Markov random field model. A generalized
expectation-maximization algorithm for maximizing the penalized likelihood is
proposed for estimating the model parameters. Extensive simulations show that
the proposed approach is more powerful than conventional false discovery rate
procedures. We apply the method to the comparison between mild cognitive
impairment, a disease status with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's or
another dementia, and normal controls in the FDG-PET imaging study of the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
