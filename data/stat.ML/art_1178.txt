Query Efficient Posterior Estimation in Scientific Experiments via
  Bayesian Active Learning
A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as
Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant
parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via
expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An
urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can
estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.
  In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting
when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior
estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior.
Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In
order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active
regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to
evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via
experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our
approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and
other heuristics for posterior estimation.
