Single-shot Adaptive Measurement for Quantum-enhanced Metrology
Quantum-enhanced metrology aims to estimate an unknown parameter such that
the precision scales better than the shot-noise bound. Single-shot adaptive
quantum-enhanced metrology (AQEM) is a promising approach that uses feedback to
tweak the quantum process according to previous measurement outcomes.
Techniques and formalism for the adaptive case are quite different from the
usual non-adaptive quantum metrology approach due to the causal relationship
between measurements and outcomes. We construct a formal framework for AQEM by
modeling the procedure as a decision-making process, and we derive the
imprecision and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound with explicit dependence on the
feedback policy. We also explain the reinforcement learning approach for
generating quantum control policies, which is adopted due to the optimal policy
being non-trivial to devise. Applying a learning algorithm based on
differential evolution enables us to attain imprecision for adaptive
interferometric phase estimation, which turns out to be SQL when non-entangled
particles are used in the scheme.
