Forecasting Framework for Open Access Time Series in Energy
In this paper we propose a framework for automated forecasting of
energy-related time series using open access data from European Network of
Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The framework provides
forecasts for various European countries using publicly available historical
data only. Our solution was benchmarked using the actual load data and the
country provided estimates (where available). We conclude that the proposed
system can produce timely forecasts with comparable prediction accuracy in a
number of cases. We also investigate the probabilistic case of forecasting -
that is, providing a probability distribution rather than a simple point
forecast - and incorporate it into a web based API that provides quick and easy
access to reliable forecasts.
