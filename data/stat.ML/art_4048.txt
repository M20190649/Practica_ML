Post Training in Deep Learning with Last Kernel
One of the main challenges of deep learning methods is the choice of an
appropriate training strategy. In particular, additional steps, such as
unsupervised pre-training, have been shown to greatly improve the performances
of deep structures. In this article, we propose an extra training step, called
post-training, which only optimizes the last layer of the network. We show that
this procedure can be analyzed in the context of kernel theory, with the first
layers computing an embedding of the data and the last layer a statistical
model to solve the task based on this embedding. This step makes sure that the
embedding, or representation, of the data is used in the best possible way for
the considered task. This idea is then tested on multiple architectures with
various data sets, showing that it consistently provides a boost in
performance.
