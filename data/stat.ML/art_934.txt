On the EM-Tau algorithm: a new EM-style algorithm with partial E-steps
The EM algorithm is one of many important tools in the field of statistics.
While often used for imputing missing data, its widespread applications include
other common statistical tasks, such as clustering. In clustering, the EM
algorithm assumes a parametric distribution for the clusters, whose parameters
are estimated through a novel iterative procedure that is based on the theory
of maximum likelihood. However, one major drawback of the EM algorithm, that
renders it impractical especially when working with large datasets, is that it
often requires several passes of the data before convergence. In this paper, we
introduce a new EM-style algorithm that implements a novel policy for
performing partial E-steps. We call the new algorithm the EM-Tau algorithm,
which can approximate the traditional EM algorithm with high accuracy but with
only a fraction of the running time.
