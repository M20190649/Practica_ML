Bayesian SPLDA
In this document we are going to derive the equations needed to implement a
Variational Bayes estimation of the parameters of the simplified probabilistic
linear discriminant analysis (SPLDA) model. This can be used to adapt SPLDA
from one database to another with few development data or to implement the
fully Bayesian recipe. Our approach is similar to Bishop's VB PPCA.
