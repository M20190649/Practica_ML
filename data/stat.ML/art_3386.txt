Bayesian optimization for materials design
We introduce Bayesian optimization, a technique developed for optimizing
time-consuming engineering simulations and for fitting machine learning models
on large datasets. Bayesian optimization guides the choice of experiments
during materials design and discovery to find good material designs in as few
experiments as possible. We focus on the case when materials designs are
parameterized by a low-dimensional vector. Bayesian optimization is built on a
statistical technique called Gaussian process regression, which allows
predicting the performance of a new design based on previously tested designs.
After providing a detailed introduction to Gaussian process regression, we
introduce two Bayesian optimization methods: expected improvement, for design
problems with noise-free evaluations; and the knowledge-gradient method, which
generalizes expected improvement and may be used in design problems with noisy
evaluations. Both methods are derived using a value-of-information analysis,
and enjoy one-step Bayes-optimality.
