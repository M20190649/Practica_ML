A Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm for the Mode Seeking Framework
In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the
mode-seeking framework. Given a dataset in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we define regions of
high density that we call cluster cores. We then consider a random walk on a
neighborhood graph built on top of our data points which is designed to be
attracted by high density regions. The strength of this attraction is
controlled by a temperature parameter $\beta > 0$. The membership of a point to
a given cluster is then the probability for the random walk to hit the
corresponding cluster core before any other. While many properties of random
walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc\dots) have been shown to
enventually encode purely local information when the number of data points
grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of cluster cores
solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of $\beta$ influences
the behavior of our algorithm: for small values of $\beta$ the result is close
to hard mode-seeking whereas when $\beta$ is close to $1$ the result is similar
to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the
scalability of our approach by providing the fuzzy clustering of a protein
configuration dataset containing a million data points in $30$ dimensions.
