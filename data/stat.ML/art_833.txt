Recurrent switching linear dynamical systems
Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams
traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear
dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into
segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on
switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that
not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching
behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These "recurrent"
switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the
conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS
models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate
inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable.
