Accelerated Distributed Dual Averaging over Evolving Networks of Growing
  Connectivity
We consider the problem of accelerating distributed optimization in
multi-agent networks by sequentially adding edges. Specifically, we extend the
distributed dual averaging (DDA) subgradient algorithm to evolving networks of
growing connectivity and analyze the corresponding improvement in convergence
rate. It is known that the convergence rate of DDA is influenced by the
algebraic connectivity of the underlying network, where better connectivity
leads to faster convergence. However, the impact of network topology design on
the convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we
begin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For
edge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the
optimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of
network resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge
scheduling. Further, we provide a tractable approach to analyze the improvement
in the convergence rate of DDA induced by the growth of network connectivity.
Our analysis reveals the connection between network topology design and the
convergence rate of DDA, and provides quantitative evaluation of DDA
acceleration for distributed optimization that is absent in the existing
analysis. Lastly, numerical experiments show that DDA can be significantly
accelerated using a sequence of well-designed networks, and our theoretical
predictions are well matched to its empirical convergence behavior.
