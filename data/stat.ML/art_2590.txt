Joint modeling of multiple time series via the beta process with
  application to motion capture segmentation
We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to the problem of jointly
modeling multiple related time series. Our model discovers a latent set of
dynamical behaviors shared among the sequences, and segments each time series
into regions defined by a subset of these behaviors. Using a beta process
prior, the size of the behavior set and the sharing pattern are both inferred
from data. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on the
Indian buffet process representation of the predictive distribution of the beta
process. Our MCMC inference algorithm efficiently adds and removes behaviors
via novel split-merge moves as well as data-driven birth and death proposals,
avoiding the need to consider a truncated model. We demonstrate promising
results on unsupervised segmentation of human motion capture data.
