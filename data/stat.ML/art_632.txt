Identification of stable models via nonparametric prediction error
  methods
A new Bayesian approach to linear system identification has been proposed in
a series of recent papers. The main idea is to frame linear system
identification as predictor estimation in an infinite dimensional space, with
the aid of regularization/Bayesian techniques. This approach guarantees the
identification of stable predictors based on the prediction error minimization.
Unluckily, the stability of the predictors does not guarantee the stability of
the impulse response of the system. In this paper we propose and compare
various techniques to address this issue. Simulations results comparing these
techniques will be provided.
