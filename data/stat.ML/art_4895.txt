algcomparison: Comparing the Performance of Graphical Structure Learning
  Algorithms with TETRAD
In this report we describe a tool for comparing the performance of graphical
causal structure learning algorithms implemented in the TETRAD freeware suite
of causal analysis methods. Currently the tool is available as package in the
TETRAD source code (written in Java). Simulations can be done varying the
number of runs, sample sizes, and data modalities. Performance on this
simulated data can then be compared for a number of algorithms, with parameters
varied and with performance statistics as selected, producing a publishable
report. The order of the algorithms in the output can be adjusted to the user's
preference using a utility function over the statistics. Data sets from
simulation can be saved along with their graphs to a file and loaded back in
for further analysis, or used for analysis by other tools. The package
presented here may also be used to compare structure learning methods across
platforms and programming languages, i.e., to compare algorithms implemented in
TETRAD with those implemented in MATLAB, Python, or R.
