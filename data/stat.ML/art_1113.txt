Spatial Modeling of Oil Exploration Areas Using Neural Networks and
  ANFIS in GIS
Exploration of hydrocarbon resources is a highly complicated and expensive
process where various geological, geochemical and geophysical factors are
developed then combined together. It is highly significant how to design the
seismic data acquisition survey and locate the exploratory wells since
incorrect or imprecise locations lead to waste of time and money during the
operation. The objective of this study is to locate high-potential oil and gas
field in 1: 250,000 sheet of Ahwaz including 20 oil fields to reduce both time
and costs in exploration and production processes. In this regard, 17 maps were
developed using GIS functions for factors including: minimum and maximum of
total organic carbon (TOC), yield potential for hydrocarbons production (PP),
Tmax peak, production index (PI), oxygen index (OI), hydrogen index (HI) as
well as presence or proximity to high residual Bouguer gravity anomalies,
proximity to anticline axis and faults, topography and curvature maps obtained
from Asmari Formation subsurface contours. To model and to integrate maps, this
study employed artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
system (ANFIS) methods. The results obtained from model validation demonstrated
that the 17x10x5 neural network with R=0.8948, RMS=0.0267, and kappa=0.9079 can
be trained better than other models such as ANFIS and predicts the potential
areas more accurately. However, this method failed to predict some oil fields
and wrongly predict some areas as potential zones.
