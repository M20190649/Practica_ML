A Kernel Test for Three-Variable Interactions with Random Processes
We apply a wild bootstrap method to the Lancaster three-variable interaction
measure in order to detect factorisation of the joint distribution on three
variables forming a stationary random process, for which the existing
permutation bootstrap method fails. As in the i.i.d. case, the Lancaster test
is found to outperform existing tests in cases for which two independent
variables individually have a weak influence on a third, but that when
considered jointly the influence is strong. The main contributions of this
paper are twofold: first, we prove that the Lancaster statistic satisfies the
conditions required to estimate the quantiles of the null distribution using
the wild bootstrap; second, the manner in which this is proved is novel,
simpler than existing methods, and can further be applied to other statistics.
