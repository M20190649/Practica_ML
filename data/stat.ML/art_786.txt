Short-term time series prediction using Hilbert space embeddings of
  autoregressive processes
Linear autoregressive models serve as basic representations of discrete time
stochastic processes. Different attempts have been made to provide non-linear
versions of the basic autoregressive process, including different versions
based on kernel methods. Motivated by the powerful framework of Hilbert space
embeddings of distributions, in this paper we apply this methodology for the
kernel embedding of an autoregressive process of order $p$. By doing so, we
provide a non-linear version of an autoregressive process, that shows increased
performance over the linear model in highly complex time series. We use the
method proposed for one-step ahead forecasting of different time-series, and
compare its performance against other non-linear methods.
