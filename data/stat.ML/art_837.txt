Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition Based on Adaptive Over-complete
  Dictionary
This paper proposes a subspace decomposition method based on an over-complete
dictionary in sparse representation, called "Sparse Signal Subspace
Decomposition" (or 3SD) method. This method makes use of a novel criterion
based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the dictionary over the data set.
This criterion, well adapted to subspace-decomposition over a dependent basis
set, adequately re ects the intrinsic characteristic of regularity of the
signal. The 3SD method combines variance, sparsity and component frequency
criteria into an unified framework. It takes benefits from using an
over-complete dictionary which preserves details and from subspace
decomposition which rejects strong noise. The 3SD method is very simple with a
linear retrieval operation. It does not require any prior knowledge on
distributions or parameters. When applied to image denoising, it demonstrates
high performances both at preserving fine details and suppressing strong noise.
