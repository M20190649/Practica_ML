Exploring Sparsity in Multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis
Recent studies in the literature have paid much attention to the sparsity in
linear classification tasks. One motivation of imposing sparsity assumption on
the linear discriminant direction is to rule out the noninformative features,
making hardly contribution to the classification problem. Most of those work
were focused on the scenarios of binary classification. In the presence of
multi-class data, preceding researches recommended individually pairwise sparse
linear discriminant analysis(LDA). However, further sparsity should be
explored. In this paper, an estimator of grouped LASSO type is proposed to take
advantage of sparsity for multi-class data. It enjoys appealing non-asymptotic
properties which allows insignificant correlations among features. This
estimator exhibits superior capability on both simulated and real data.
