A Note on the SPICE Method
In this article, we analyze the SPICE method developed in [1], and establish
its connections with other standard sparse estimation methods such as the Lasso
and the LAD-Lasso. This result positions SPICE as a computationally efficient
technique for the calculation of Lasso-type estimators. Conversely, this
connection is very useful for establishing the asymptotic properties of SPICE
under several problem scenarios and for suggesting suitable modifications in
cases where the naive version of SPICE would not work.
