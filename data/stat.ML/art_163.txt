Variable Selection in High Dimensions with Random Designs and Orthogonal
  Matching Pursuit
The performance of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for variable selection
is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case,
since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of
the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the
coefficient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the
performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm
[\textit{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} \textbf{55} (2009) 2183--2202]. Moreover,
variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefficient
vector, whereby one has only control on the $\ell_1$ norm of the smaller
coefficients, is also analyzed. As a consequence of these results, we also show
that the coefficient estimate satisfies strong oracle type inequalities.
