A simple yet efficient algorithm for multiple kernel learning under
  elastic-net constraints
This papers introduces an algorithm for the solution of multiple kernel
learning (MKL) problems with elastic-net constraints on the kernel weights. The
algorithm compares very favourably in terms of time and space complexity to
existing approaches and can be implemented with simple code that does not rely
on external libraries (except a conventional SVM solver).
