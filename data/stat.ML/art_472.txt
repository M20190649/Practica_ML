Convex Modeling of Interactions with Strong Heredity
We consider the task of fitting a regression model involving interactions
among a potentially large set of covariates, in which we wish to enforce strong
heredity. We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our
proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH
[Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso,
and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to
a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating
directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has
guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any
convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension
to the setting of generalized linear models. We derive an unbiased estimator of
the degrees of freedom of FAMILY, and explore its performance in a simulation
study and on an HIV sequence data set.
