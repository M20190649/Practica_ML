An Algorithmic Framework for Computing Validation Performance Bounds by
  Using Suboptimal Models
Practical model building processes are often time-consuming because many
different models must be trained and validated. In this paper, we introduce a
novel algorithm that can be used for computing the lower and the upper bounds
of model validation errors without actually training the model itself. A key
idea behind our algorithm is using a side information available from a
suboptimal model. If a reasonably good suboptimal model is available, our
algorithm can compute lower and upper bounds of many useful quantities for
making inferences on the unknown target model. We demonstrate the advantage of
our algorithm in the context of model selection for regularized learning
problems.
