Bayesian estimation of possible causal direction in the presence of
  latent confounders using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic structural equation
  model with individual-specific effects
We consider learning the possible causal direction of two observed variables
in the presence of latent confounding variables. Several existing methods have
been shown to consistently estimate causal direction assuming linear or some
type of nonlinear relationship and no latent confounders. However, the
estimation results could be distorted if either assumption is actually
violated. In this paper, we first propose a new linear non-Gaussian acyclic
structural equation model with individual-specific effects that allows latent
confounders to be considered. We then propose an empirical Bayesian approach
for estimating possible causal direction using the new model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method using artificial and real-world data.
