The Mondrian Kernel
We introduce the Mondrian kernel, a fast random feature approximation to the
Laplace kernel. It is suitable for both batch and online learning, and admits a
fast kernel-width-selection procedure as the random features can be re-used
efficiently for all kernel widths. The features are constructed by sampling
trees via a Mondrian process [Roy and Teh, 2009], and we highlight the
connection to Mondrian forests [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2014], where trees are
also sampled via a Mondrian process, but fit independently. This link provides
a new insight into the relationship between kernel methods and random forests.
