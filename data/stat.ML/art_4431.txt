Guided Machine Learning for power grid segmentation
The segmentation of large scale power grids into zones is crucial for control
room operators when managing the grid complexity near real time. In this paper
we propose a new method in two steps which is able to automatically do this
segmentation, while taking into account the real time context, in order to help
them handle shifting dynamics. Our method relies on a "guided" machine learning
approach. As a first step, we define and compute a task specific "Influence
Graph" in a guided manner. We indeed simulate on a grid state chosen
interventions, representative of our task of interest (managing active power
flows in our case). For visualization and interpretation, we then build a
higher representation of the grid relevant to this task by applying the graph
community detection algorithm \textit{Infomap} on this Influence Graph. To
illustrate our method and demonstrate its practical interest, we apply it on
commonly used systems, the IEEE-14 and IEEE-118. We show promising and original
interpretable results, especially on the previously well studied RTS-96 system
for grid segmentation. We eventually share initial investigation and results on
a large-scale system, the French power grid, whose segmentation had a
surprising resemblance with RTE's historical partitioning.
