Training Gaussian Mixture Models at Scale via Coresets
How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this
work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is
a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset
also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps
surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension
and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set
size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a
good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such
coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming
settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our
results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in
computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of
Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets suggests that
our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with
negligible approximation error.
