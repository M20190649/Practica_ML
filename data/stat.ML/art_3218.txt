Fast Embedding for JOFC Using the Raw Stress Criterion
The Joint Optimization of Fidelity and Commensurability (JOFC) manifold
matching methodology embeds an omnibus dissimilarity matrix consisting of
multiple dissimilarities on the same set of objects. One approach to this
embedding optimizes the preservation of fidelity to each individual
dissimilarity matrix together with commensurability of each given observation
across modalities via iterative majorization of a raw stress error criterion by
successive Guttman transforms. In this paper, we exploit the special structure
inherent to JOFC to exactly and efficiently compute the successive Guttman
transforms, and as a result we are able to greatly speed up the JOFC procedure
for both in-sample and out-of-sample embedding. We demonstrate the scalability
of our implementation on both real and simulated data examples.
