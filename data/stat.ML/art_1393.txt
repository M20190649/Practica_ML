An Ensemble Classifier for Predicting the Onset of Type II Diabetes
Prediction of disease onset from patient survey and lifestyle data is quickly
becoming an important tool for diagnosing a disease before it progresses. In
this study, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) questionnaire is used to predict the onset of type II diabetes. An
ensemble model using the output of five classification algorithms was developed
to predict the onset on diabetes based on 16 features. The ensemble model had
an AUC of 0.834 indicating high performance.
