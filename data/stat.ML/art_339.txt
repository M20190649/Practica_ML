Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Process Models
We propose a family of multivariate Gaussian process models for correlated
outputs, based on assuming that the likelihood function takes the generic form
of the multivariate exponential family distribution (EFD). We denote this model
as a multivariate generalized Gaussian process model, and derive Taylor and
Laplace algorithms for approximate inference on the generic model. By
instantiating the EFD with specific parameter functions, we obtain two novel GP
models (and corresponding inference algorithms) for correlated outputs: 1) a
Von-Mises GP for angle regression; and 2) a Dirichlet GP for regressing on the
multinomial simplex.
