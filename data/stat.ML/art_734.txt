Relative Density and Exact Recovery in Heterogeneous Stochastic Block
  Models
The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for
networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering
communities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there
are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and
computational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its
full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of
communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the
connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows
us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right
parameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the
various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations
via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\log n$ is considered to be
the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex
methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right
circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser),
to recover very small clusters (up to $\sqrt{\log n}$ size), if there are just
a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$).
