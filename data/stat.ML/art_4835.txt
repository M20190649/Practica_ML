Unsupervised Learning with Imbalanced Data via Structure Consolidation
  Latent Variable Model
Unsupervised learning on imbalanced data is challenging because, when given
imbalanced data, current model is often dominated by the major category and
ignores the categories with small amount of data. We develop a latent variable
model that can cope with imbalanced data by dividing the latent space into a
shared space and a private space. Based on Gaussian Process Latent Variable
Models, we propose a new kernel formulation that enables the separation of
latent space and derives an efficient variational inference method. The
performance of our model is demonstrated with an imbalanced medical image
dataset.
