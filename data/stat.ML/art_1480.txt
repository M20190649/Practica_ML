Variational Inference over Non-differentiable Cardiac Simulators using
  Bayesian Optimization
Performing inference over simulators is generally intractable as their
runtime means we cannot compute a marginal likelihood. We develop a
likelihood-free inference method to infer parameters for a cardiac simulator,
which replicates electrical flow through the heart to the body surface. We
improve the fit of a state-of-the-art simulator to an electrocardiogram (ECG)
recorded from a real patient.
