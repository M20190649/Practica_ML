An Outlyingness Matrix for Multivariate Functional Data Classification
The classification of multivariate functional data is an important task in
scientific research. Unlike point-wise data, functional data are usually
classified by their shapes rather than by their scales. We define an
outlyingness matrix by extending directional outlyingness, an effective measure
of the shape variation of curves that combines the direction of outlyingness
with conventional depth. We propose two classifiers based on directional
outlyingness and the outlyingness matrix, respectively. Our classifiers provide
better performance compared with existing depth-based classifiers when applied
on both univariate and multivariate functional data from simulation studies. We
also test our methods on two data problems: speech recognition and gesture
classification, and obtain results that are consistent with the findings from
the simulated data.
