An Aggregation Method for Sparse Logistic Regression
$L_1$ regularized logistic regression has now become a workhorse of data
mining and bioinformatics: it is widely used for many classification problems,
particularly ones with many features. However, $L_1$ regularization typically
selects too many features and that so-called false positives are unavoidable.
In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze an aggregation method for sparse
logistic regression in high dimensions. This approach linearly combines the
estimators from a suitable set of logistic models with different underlying
sparsity patterns and can balance the predictive ability and model
interpretability. Numerical performance of our proposed aggregation method is
then investigated using simulation studies. We also analyze a published
genome-wide case-control dataset to further evaluate the usefulness of the
aggregation method in multilocus association mapping.
