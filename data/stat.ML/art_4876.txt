Combining Random Walks and Nonparametric Bayesian Topic Model for
  Community Detection
Community detection has been an active research area for decades. Among all
probabilistic models, Stochastic Block Model has been the most popular one.
This paper introduces a novel probabilistic model: RW-HDP, based on random
walks and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for community extraction. In RW-HDP,
random walks conducted in a social network are treated as documents; nodes are
treated as words. By using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, a nonparametric
Bayesian model, we are not only able to cluster nodes into different
communities, but also determine the number of communities automatically. We use
Stochastic Variational Inference for our model inference, which makes our
method time efficient and can be easily extended to an online learning
algorithm.
