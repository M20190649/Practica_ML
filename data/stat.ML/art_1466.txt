Globally Optimal Symbolic Regression
In this study we introduce a new technique for symbolic regression that
guarantees global optimality. This is achieved by formulating a mixed integer
non-linear program (MINLP) whose solution is a symbolic mathematical expression
of minimum complexity that explains the observations. We demonstrate our
approach by rediscovering Kepler's law on planetary motion using exoplanet data
and Galileo's pendulum periodicity equation using experimental data.
