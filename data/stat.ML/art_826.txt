Independent Component Analysis by Entropy Maximization with Kernels
Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most popular method for blind
source separation (BSS) with a diverse set of applications, such as biomedical
signal processing, video and image analysis, and communications. Maximum
likelihood (ML), an optimal theoretical framework for ICA, requires knowledge
of the true underlying probability density function (PDF) of the latent
sources, which, in many applications, is unknown. ICA algorithms cast in the ML
framework often deviate from its theoretical optimality properties due to poor
estimation of the source PDF. Therefore, accurate estimation of source PDFs is
critical in order to avoid model mismatch and poor ICA performance. In this
paper, we propose a new and efficient ICA algorithm based on entropy
maximization with kernels, (ICA-EMK), which uses both global and local
measuring functions as constraints to dynamically estimate the PDF of the
sources with reasonable complexity. In addition, the new algorithm performs
optimization with respect to each of the cost function gradient directions
separately, enabling parallel implementations on multi-core computers. We
demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EMK over competing ICA algorithms
using simulated as well as real-world data.
