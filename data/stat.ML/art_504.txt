Streaming Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture
  Models
In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming
data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity with the observed
data. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice;
existing inference algorithms are either not applicable to streaming
applications or not extensible to BNP models. For the special case of Dirichlet
processes, streaming inference has been considered. However, there is growing
interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random
measures (NRMs). We work within this general framework and present a streaming
variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models. Our algorithm is based
on assumed density filtering (ADF), leading straightforwardly to expectation
propagation (EP) for large-scale batch inference as well. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text
corpora.
