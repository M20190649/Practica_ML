Joint Estimation of Multiple Dependent Gaussian Graphical Models with
  Applications to Mouse Genomics
Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent conditional dependence
among random variables. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for data
arising from a group of Gaussian graphical models that are themselves
dependent. A motivating example is that of modeling gene expression collected
on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is
affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues,
but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume
independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple
dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the
systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph
dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific
variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers
jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the
proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to
a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and
obtain biologically plausible results.
