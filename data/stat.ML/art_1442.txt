Lagged Exact Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection with Parameter
  Estimation
Identifying changes in the generative process of sequential data, known as
changepoint detection, has become an increasingly important topic for a wide
variety of fields. A recently developed approach, which we call EXact Online
Bayesian Changepoint Detection (EXO), has shown reasonable results with
efficient computation for real time updates. The method is based on a
\textit{forward} recursive message-passing algorithm. However, the detected
changepoints from these methods are unstable. We propose a new algorithm called
Lagged EXact Online Bayesian Changepoint Detection (LEXO) that improves the
accuracy and stability of the detection by incorporating $\ell$-time lags to
the inference. The new algorithm adds a recursive \textit{backward} step to the
forward EXO and has computational complexity linear in the number of added
lags. Estimation of parameters associated with regimes is also developed.
Simulation studies with three common changepoint models show that the detected
changepoints from LEXO are much more stable and parameter estimates from LEXO
have considerably lower MSE than EXO. We illustrate applicability of the
methods with two real world data examples comparing the EXO and LEXO.
