Two New Approaches to Compressed Sensing Exhibiting Both Robust Sparse
  Recovery and the Grouping Effect
In this paper we introduce a new optimization formulation for sparse
regression and compressed sensing, called CLOT (Combined L-One and Two),
wherein the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\ell_1$- and
$\ell_2$-norms. This formulation differs from the Elastic Net (EN) formulation,
in which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\ell_1$- and
$\ell_2$-norm squared. It is shown that, in the context of compressed sensing,
the EN formulation does not achieve robust recovery of sparse vectors, whereas
the new CLOT formulation achieves robust recovery. Also, like EN but unlike
LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect, wherein coefficients
of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned
roughly comparable values. It is already known LASSO does not have the grouping
effect. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best features of both LASSO
(robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect).
  The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse
Group LASSO) which was introduced into the literature previously, but without
any analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery. It is
shown here that SGL achieves robust sparse recovery, and also achieves a
version of the grouping effect in that coefficients of highly correlated
columns belonging to the same group of the measurement (or design) matrix are
assigned roughly comparable values.
