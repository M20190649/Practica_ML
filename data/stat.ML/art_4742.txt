Property-driven State-Space Coarsening for Continuous Time Markov Chains
Dynamical systems with large state-spaces are often expensive to thoroughly
explore experimentally. Coarse-graining methods aim to define simpler systems
which are more amenable to analysis and exploration; most current methods,
however, focus on a priori state aggregation based on similarities in
transition rates, which is not necessarily reflected in similar behaviours at
the level of trajectories. We propose a way to coarsen the state-space of a
system which optimally preserves the satisfaction of a set of logical
specifications about the system's trajectories. Our approach is based on
Gaussian Process emulation and Multi-Dimensional Scaling, a dimensionality
reduction technique which optimally preserves distances in non-Euclidean
spaces. We show how to obtain low-dimensional visualisations of the system's
state-space from the perspective of properties' satisfaction, and how to define
macro-states which behave coherently with respect to the specifications. Our
approach is illustrated on a non-trivial running example, showing promising
performance and high computational efficiency.
