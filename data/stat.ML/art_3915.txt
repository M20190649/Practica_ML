Iterative proportional scaling revisited: a modern optimization
  perspective
This paper revisits the classic iterative proportional scaling (IPS) from a
modern optimization perspective. In contrast to the criticisms made in the
literature, we show that based on a coordinate descent characterization, IPS
can be slightly modified to deliver coefficient estimates, and from a
majorization-minimization standpoint, IPS can be extended to handle log-affine
models with features not necessarily binary-valued or nonnegative. Furthermore,
some state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as block-wise computation,
randomization and momentum-based acceleration can be employed to provide more
scalable IPS algorithms, as well as some regularized variants of IPS for
concurrent feature selection.
