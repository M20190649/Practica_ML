Sparse Representation Classification Beyond L1 Minimization and the
  Subspace Assumption
The sparse representation classifier (SRC) has been utilized in various
classification problems, which makes use of L1 minimization and is shown to
work well for image recognition problems that satisfy a subspace assumption. In
this paper we propose a new implementation of SRC via screening, establish its
equivalence to the original SRC under regularity conditions, and prove its
classification consistency under a latent subspace model. The results are
demonstrated via simulations and real data experiments, where the new algorithm
achieves comparable numerical performance but significantly faster.
