Very Fast Kernel SVM under Budget Constraints
In this paper we propose a fast online Kernel SVM algorithm under tight
budget constraints. We propose to split the input space using LVQ and train a
Kernel SVM in each cluster. To allow for online training, we propose to limit
the size of the support vector set of each cluster using different strategies.
We show in the experiment that our algorithm is able to achieve high accuracy
while having a very high number of samples processed per second both in
training and in the evaluation.
