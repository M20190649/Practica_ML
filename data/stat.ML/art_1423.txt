Adaptive Nonparametric Clustering
This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called
Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering
structure by checking at different points and for different scales on departure
from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering
structure in terms of weights \( w_{ij} \) each of them measures the degree of
local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of
"no gap" between them. % The procedure starts from very local scale, then the
parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully
adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their
structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the
procedure is able to recover different clusters with sharp edges or manifold
structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive
numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various
artificial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states
optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity.
