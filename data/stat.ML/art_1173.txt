Subset Selection for Multiple Linear Regression via Optimization
Subset selection in multiple linear regression is to choose a subset of
candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff error and the number of variables
selected. We built mathematical programming models for subset selection and
compare the performance of an LP-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored
valid inequalities to known heuristics. We found that our models quickly find a
quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality. Our
models are also applicable with slight modifications to the case with more
candidate explanatory variables than observations. For this case, we provide
mathematical programming models, propose new criteria, and develop heuristic
algorithms based on mathematical programming.
