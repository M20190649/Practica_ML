Black-box Importance Sampling
Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but
its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the
importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by
studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance
weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism.
Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult
problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of
improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both
theoretical and empirical analyses are provided.
