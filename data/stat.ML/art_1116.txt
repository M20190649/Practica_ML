Estimating the Number of Clusters via Normalized Cluster Instability
We improve current instability-based methods for the selection of the number
of clusters $k$ in cluster analysis by developing a normalized cluster
instability measure that corrects for the distribution of cluster sizes, a
previously unaccounted driver of cluster instability. We show that our
normalized instability measure outperforms current instability-based measures
across the whole sequence of possible $k$ and especially overcomes limitations
in the context of large $k$. We also compare, for the first time, model-based
and model-free approaches to determine cluster-instability and find their
performance to be comparable. We make our method available in the R-package
\verb+cstab+.
