On the convergence rate of the three operator splitting scheme
The three operator splitting scheme was recently proposed by [Davis and Yin,
2015] as a method to optimize composite objective functions with one convex
smooth term and two convex (possibly non-smooth) terms for which we have access
to their proximity operator. In this short note we provide an alternative proof
for the sublinear rate of convergence of this method.
