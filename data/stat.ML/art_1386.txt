Demixing Structured Superposition Signals from Periodic and Aperiodic
  Nonlinear Observations
We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) structured high-dimensional
vectors from a limited number of nonlinear observations where this nonlinearity
is due to either a periodic or an aperiodic function. We study certain families
of structured superposition models, and propose a method which provably
recovers the components given (nearly) $m = \mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$
denotes the sparsity level of the underlying components. This strictly improves
upon previous nonlinear demixing techniques and asymptotically matches the best
possible sample complexity. We also provide a range of simulations to
illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
